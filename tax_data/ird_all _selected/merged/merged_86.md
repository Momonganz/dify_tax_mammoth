Introducing a Research and Development (R&D) tax credit is one ofthe government's priorities. 2. All OECD countries provide support to business R&D, usually through some combination of tax credits and grants. Tax credits should be considered as a complement to grants rather than as an alternative. Tax credits and grants have different strengths and weaknesses. Having both enables each to be directed at their particular strengths. 3. A tax credit's strengths are likely to be greatest where it operates as neutrally as possible as per types of firms and levels of assistance and where there are boundary-type judgements, these are made in as explicit and rigid way as possible. Grants we would suggest are a better mechanism for targeting particular types of firms if that is a goal for developing the New Zealand R&D ecosystem. 4. There is an opportunity as part of the design of the R&D tax credit to learn from the experiences of other countries and from New Zealand's own previous experience to ensure the Government gets the best value from the policy while ensuring as far as possible risks are managed. Key risks to be managed are around the integrity of the tax system and protection of the revenue base. 5. Choices in the design and implementation of the credit will reduce but not eliminate these risks. 6. There will be trade-offs between policies that might maximise support for business R&D and measures that might undermine other parts of the tax system. 7. One way to manage the risks is a thorough policy and implementation design process. We consider 1 April 2019 is a feasible implementation date for an R&D tax credit, though there are some risks associated with this timeframe.

It is recommended that you: • Forward this report to the Ministers of Finance and Research, Science and Innovation • Convene a Ministerial sub-committee .consisting of you and the Ministers of Finance and Research, Science and Innovation. Richard Braae Senior Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister ofRevenue I I 2017 IR2017/596: Introducing a Research and Development Tax Credit Page2 Withheld under section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 In Confidence Background 9. The previous Labour Government introduced an R&D tax credit in 2008. This was repealed by the National Government in 2009. 10. Introducing a 12.5% R&D tax credit was a policy your Party campaigned on during the election. 11. Though it has not been recognised as an immediate priority in terms of being on the 1 00-day Plan, we understand implementing this policy is a Government priority. 12. There are three Ministers who will have responsibilities relating to introducing the R&D tax credit. These are you, as Minister ofRevenue, the Minister ofFinance and the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation. 13. The purpose of this Report is to assist in your engagement with your Ministerial colleagues. Ways of supporting business R&D 14. Governments have different ways of supporting business R&D, broadly divided into tax credits and grants. 15. Grants and tax credits are not interchangeable. Grants usually involve an application and pre-approval process. Tax credits are more non-discretionary - once eligibility has been defined, frrms self-assess their eligibility and submit their claim for the credit without further bureaucratic intervention. 16. However, these distinctions are not hard and fast and some countries' grant schemes have features that bring them closer to tax credits and vice versa. 17. Their different characteristics mean that grants are perceived to work best for targeted interventions to grow particular types of R&D whereas tax credits, being non-discretionary, are more suited to providing broad support for all business R&D. 18. In New Zealand, R&D is currently supported via grants 1 provided by Callaghan Innovation and a tax loss cash-out scheme administered by Inland Revenue. The cash-out scheme is targeted to start-ups because these frrms are more likely to face cash flow constraints, but eligibility extends to other companies. Projected expenditure on grants for 2017/18 is $171 million and for the tax loss cash-out $13 million. 1 There are three Grant schemes: Growth Grants, Project Grants and Student Grants. IR20 17/596: Introducing a Research and Development Tax Credit Page3 In Confidence 19. We consider any consideration of an R&D tax credit should not happen in isolation but involve consideration of all of Govermnent's objectives in this space and a matching of instruments (tax credits, grants, loans, tax-loss cash-outs) to where they can best advance govermnent objectives. Perspectives on support for R&D 20. The New Zealand tax system operates within a broad-base low-rate framework. The essence of this framework is that tax operates neutrally and as much in the background as possible. 21. One implication of this framework is that the tax system is generally not used to address externalities 2 - either positively or negatively. Inland Revenue's position is that there should be a high burden of proof before moving away from broad-base low-rate principles to using the tax system to address externalities. This is because there are many activities that proponents could support on the basis of a possible positive externality. Allowing concessions can quickly lead to a demand for further exceptions and an undermining of the coherence of the tax system. Inland Revenue's approach has been supported by successive tax reviews. 22. Nonetheless, all OECD countries provide some tax or non-tax incentives for business R&D. This is on the basis of the positive externalities that arise from R&D. 23. R&D is beneficial in terms of promoting productivity and economic growth but frrms underinvest in R&D because they catmot capture all the benefits flowing from it for themselves. Govermnent support is justified in terms of raising the amount of R&D from what it otherwise would have been so as to get more of the social benefits. 24. A majority of OECD countries provide tax credits as part of a programme of supporting R&D. Within the OECD, New Zealand is something of an outlier in not having an R&D tax credit. 25. Even though R&D is one of the activities for which there is the strongest empirical evidence for positive externalities, in the past we have argued against R&D credits on the grounds that the likely benefits of such a tax are likely to be outweighed by its costs. Costs include a reduction in the consistency and coherence of the tax system and a potential for considerable accounting activity being devoted to recharacterising expenses to benefit from tax credits. This continues to be our first-best advice. At the same time some of our concerns may be moderated by a well-designed R&D tax credit that draws on international best practice. 26. In introducing an R&D tax credit, we consider there needs to be attention to protecting the integrity of the tax system and protecting the fiscal base. Within the design of the tax credit, we anticipate there will need to be trade-offs between policies that might maximise support for R&D and measures that might undermine other parts of the tax system. 2 An externality, sometimes refetTed to as a spillover, arises where there are costs or benefits that affect a patty that did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. IR20 17/596: Introducing a Research and Development Tax Credit Page4 In Confidence Risks to be managed with an R&D tax credit 27. The global history ofR&D tax incentives is one of expenditure blowouts, followed by reviews, followed by tightening up. This is not conducive to scheme stability, which is important for growing business R&D. 28. We suggest there are two particular risks to be aware of The first is recharacterisation ofbusiness activity as R&D. This means the Government spends money without gaining any of the externalities that it expects from subsidising R&D. It also weakens the tax system because if firms perceive they can exploit weaknesses in one part of the system this weakens the voluntary compliance framework on which our tax system is built. 29. Relatedly, there is a risk of unanticipated fiscal costs. In part, this is likely to reflect recharacterisation. But it appears, from overseas experience, that there are particular features of tax credit schemes that are more likely to lead to aggressive claiming by firms, or promotion of such by tax advisors. 30. Consequently, we think there are some features of the tax credit that will be important for minimising these risks, even though they cannot be avoided completely: • introducing an R&D tax credit should be more than re-implementing the 2008 policy. Though the previous policy provides a good starting point, there is an opportunity to learn about what has changed since then in the way businesses operate and from other jurisdictions about what works well and to adjust our scheme accordingly; • tax credits should be considered as a complement to grants rather than as an alternative. Tax credits and grants have different strengths and weaknesses. Having both enables each to be directed at their particular strengths; • a tax credit's strengths are likely to be greatest if it operates as neutrally as possible as per types of firms and levels of assistance and where there are boundary-type judgements, these are made in as explicit and rigid way as possible. Grants we would suggest are a better mechanism for targeting particular types of firms if that is a goal for developing the New Zealand R&D ecosystem; • the way R&D is defined and potentially excluding certain sectors or activities :fi:om the scheme are also ways of managing risk. This will include careful assessment of how to treat R&D expenditure on software and mining, and whether to extend the credit to R&D that is undertaken overseas. Importantly, our initial exploration of these issues suggests that the previous revenue protection measures in the 2008 rules may no longer be sufficient; • clarifying our expectations of tax advisors and introducing an accountability framework for them will minimise risks around their adopting an aggressive tax-planning oriented approach; • early and significant engagement, jointly with Callaghan Innovation, with firms undertaking R&D, will help us better understand these issues and also shape business expectations about how the tax credit is likely to work. IR2017/596: Introducing a Research and Development Tax Credit PageS In Confidence • we consider the cost of an R&D tax credit should be charged against the Vote: Business, Science and limovation appropriation rather than being recorded as a reduction in company tax receipts, as this is more likely to focus attention on expenditure growing more rapidly than anticipated. 31. We note that New Zealand has some strengths that can assist in the development of a stable R&D tax credit regime: • New Zealand's small size makes it easier to achieve good coverage ofthose firms likely to be interested in an R&D tax credit; • Callaghan Innovation and MBIE know the sector; • Inland Revenue has close working relationships with the accounting and tax advisory professions. 32. Because we anticipate introducing the R&D tax credit will involve more than re- implementing the 2008 policy, we have indicated to MBIE that 1 April 2019 is the earliest feasible commencement date for a new scheme. In doing so we have pointed out that we see three sets ofrisks associated with this time:fi-ame: • The capacity of applicant firms to be ready; • The willingness of accounting software developers to provide systems that will support firms being able to integrate their R&D tax credit application with their normal business operations; • Inland Revenue's operational capacity given Business Transformation and 100-day Plan projects. 33. The likelihood and scale of these risks will become clearer as the design ofthe R&D tax credit progresses. 34. MBIE has conveyed this advice to the Minister for Research, Science and Innovation. 35. Allowing time for policy and implementation design will allow good participation with the R&D sector in designing the rules, identification and mitigation of fiscal risks reducing policy instability, and engagement with other countries to ensure we are adopting current best practice. Next steps 36. As previously stated, there are three Ministers with an interest in this policy, with each of you having particular areas of focus. MBIE has provided advice to its Minister (Briefing number 0890 17-18) and this has been forwarded to you. MBIE has also suggested there be a Ministerial sub-connnittee consisting of you, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation. We endorse this suggestion.

Allowable as a deduction 2.Research and development expenditure is deductible for tax purposes provided that: The expenditure has been incurred in deriving income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income; and The taxpayer treats the amount as an expense for accounting purposes by applying the asset recognition criteria contained in financial reporting standard NZ IAS-38. NZ IAS-38 3.Under NZ IAS-38, expenditure on “research” is expensed, while expenditure on “development” is expensed until the entity can establish that 6 criteria are met, in which case the expenditure is capitalised and depreciated. The recognition of an asset is a high threshold, resulting in the majority of development expenditure being expensed. 4.NZ IAS-38 defines “research” as “original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge or understanding.” The term “development” is defined as “the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services before the start of commercial production or use.” 2. s 9(2)(a) IN CONFIDENCE Page 2 of 3 Loss continuity 5.A person that has incurred R&D expenditure may choose to allocate all or part of the deduction to a later income year. This ensures that deductions for R&D are not lost under the shareholder continuity rules for carrying forward losses when companies bring in new equity investors. Loss-cash out 6.Start-up companies are able to receive a payment up to 28 percent (the current company tax rate) of their tax losses from research and development expenditure in any given year, instead of carrying the losses forward to a future tax year. 7.A cashed-out loss is effectively an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future income. 8.To be eligible, a company must be a loss-making company resident in New Zealand, with a sufficient proportion of labour expenditure on research and development. 9.The amount of losses that can be cashed out has been capped as follows: Tax year Amount of loss Cash-out value 2015-16 $500,000 $140,000 2016-17 $800,000 $224,000 2017-18 $1.1 million $308,000 2018-29 $1.4 million $392,000 2019-20 $1.7 million $476,000 2020-2021 onwards $2 million $560,000 Previous R&D tax credit 10.A tax credit for research and development was enacted in 2008, but repealed in 2009. Black hole expenditure 11.Black hole expenditure is business expenditure of a capital nature that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes and does not give rise to a depreciable asset, so cannot be deducted as tax depreciation over time. 12.Amendments were made in 2014 to allow deductions for certain black hole R&D expenditure, such as expenses incurred for the purpose of applying for a patent. Capital gains tax and R&D 13.New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. This indirectly incentivises R&D as when a business ultimately decides to sell its idea, it is not subject to tax. Implications of New Zealand’s approach to R&D 14.As we do not have a tax credit for R&D expenditure, businesses have no incentive to separate out from other deductions the amount spent on R&D. This means that the amount spent on R&D may be under-reported to Statistics New Zealand. IN CONFIDENCE Page 3 of 3 Consultation with Treasury 15.Treasury was informed about this briefing note.

This Note outlines factors to consider in relation to the commencement date of an R&D tax credit. For the reasons set out below, Inland Revenue recommends a 2020 start date rather than a 2019 start date. Background and Context 2. There are three factors prompting this Note. 3. First, the incoming Government's policy is to re-introduce an R&D tax credit, with the goal of encouraging greater levels of business R&D. In taking this step, it is sensible to consider whether there are other parts of the tax system that might be frustrating firms from undertaking R&D. 4. Second, in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Trustpower decision), IR has been considering the approach to feasibility and black hole expenditure. 5. Finally, Minister Nash has received a letter from Business New Zealand, the Angel Association, New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, and the Corporate Taxpayers Group. This letter argues that current tax law which prevents tax losses being carried forward if more than 51 per cent of ownership in a company changes hinders innovation in New Zealand. They instead propose the adoption of a same or similar business test. IN CONFIDENCE Page 1 of 3 3. s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 6. These factors come together when considering companies in loss that are undertaking R&D and other productivity-enhancing expenditure- a relatively common outcome for start-ups. Will they be incentivised to undertake more R&D by the tax credit? Are there other settings in the tax system which are deterring them from undertaking R&D or treating them less favourably than other firms- perhaps older, larger and more established firms, that are in profit? Relevant factors under current tax law 7. General factors : • There is no R&D tax credit, but Government policy is to introduce one. • As a general principle, losses are carried forward rather than being paid out. This non-symmetrical treatment of losses (compared to profits) is motivated by protection of the tax base. • Where there is a breach of (ownership) continuity, losses cannot be carried forward. This too is motivated by protection of the tax base , but is an asymmetry that discourages taking risk. 8. Within the tax system, there are some factors that already provide more favourable treatment for firms undertaking R&D: • R&D expenditure is deductible (can be expensed) even though it is often contributing to the creation of an asset • For R&D intensive firms, there is a (capped) cashing out of tax-losses • R&D expenditure can be allocated, in total or in part, to a later income year 1 . This ensures deductions for R&D are not lost under the shareholder continuity rules when a company is sold. • Amendments were made in 2014 to allow deductions for certain black hole R&D expenditure, such as expenses incurred for the purpose of applying for a patent. 9. A final point is that there is currently no capital gains tax, which is potentially advantageous to start -ups. This issue, however, is within the terms of reference of the Tax Working Group. Assessment of the current system 10. Firms that have current profits (perhaps from some other line of business), are currently able to realise the full value of their deductions for R&D. For firms that don't have current profits, R&D deductions must be deferred until the firm has profits. This non-symmetric treatment of firms in loss compared with firms in profit can be considered as treating the latter more favourably than the former. Given that the typical high-tech start-up company will be in loss, this could be argued as creating a disincentive for them, and of their undertaking R&D. 11. If the R&D tax cr edit is not refundable (ie, is not paid out if a f irm is in loss) - and IR argues strongly it should not be because of fiscal risks that arise when the tax credit is refundable - it will provide weaker incentives for start-ups to undertake more R&D. 12. At the same time, it can be noted that within the tax system there are already provisions which recognise the circumstances that might afflict firms undertaking R&D and compensates for these. 13. In addition, grants provided by Callaghan Innovation are a means for Government directly support ing firms at an early, pre-profit stage which are undertaking R&D. The treatment of firms should be considered from a wider perspect ive than just the tax system. 1 Thi s provision will ne ed to be c on sidered in development of the R&D tax credit . IN CONFIDENCE Page 2 of 3 14. Nonetheless, it can be noted that the current system is not ideal. The concerns are: • There is a patchwork of provisions that have been put in place to assist or compensate firms undertaking R&D. This creates complexity-complexity which is likely to be aggravated by the introduction of an R&D tax credit. • The patchwork creates fiscal risk if rationalisation of the rules is not undertaken at the same time any R&D tax credit is introduced. • Where these compensations have been put in place, they are tightly tied to R&D because this is a relatively tangible concept to define. However, there are innovative firms that are equally worthy of Government support, in terms of contributing to economic growth and the goals of c diverse, sustainable low- carbon economy, and these firms are not receiving special consideration. Where IR would like to head 15. Pulling together these factors, Inland Revenue considers the tax system should ideally move in the following directions (though noting that some of these concepts do not currently have funding committed for them): • Introduce an R&D tax credit to address the spillovers arising from firms undertaking R&D 16. Implications for introduction date of an R&D tax credit 17. In the cross-agency report on the introduction of an R&D tax credit (IR2017/644), Ministers are asked to consider introducing the credit on 1 April of either 2019 or 2020. 18. Inland Revenue has not previously expressed a strong preference with respect to these dates. 19. However, we now consider that ideally the R&D tax credit will be developed in the context of the above issues-particularly regarding loss continuity, to allow for consistent treatment of losses. The complexity of these issues and the time that will be required to resolve them leads us to recommend a 1 April 2020 start date for the R&D tax credit. Consultation with Treasury 20.

It proposes certain adjustments to the definition of eligible R&D. It responds to a request from Ministers at DEV for advice about the penalty rules that would apply to inappropriate claims under the tax credit. 3.Integrity will be an important feature for the R&D tax credit. Perceptions that the scheme is rewarding claims that do not represent genuine R&D or that tax advisors are claiming too great a share of the expenditure will undermine the credibility of the scheme. 4.A review of claims from the 2008 tax credit highlights circumstances in which firms were able to receive the tax credit for business as usual expenditure. Consequently, officials propose tightening the rules in two areas – where there is dual purpose expenditure and where firms are being paid by a third party to undertake work. 5.Software is an important area of R&D expenditure. It is also an area where officials consider tightening of the rules that applied in 2008 could be warranted. We are working on developing a robust set of proposals for defining eligibility of software expenditure. We expect this to be complete by May 2018 and anticipate following this by targeted consultation with relevant stakeholders. 6.Officials consider the shortfall penalties framework that applies to all tax returns is a suitable basis for applying penalties to incorrect R&D tax credit claims. However, we also consider the risks around R&D tax credits may be greater when advisors are paid on a contingency basis. Therefore an extension to the framework is proposed where the offense is non-trivial and the advisor shares in the value of the claim.

(CAB-18-MIN-0056 refers) Officials have prepared a discussion document (2216 17-18, IR2018/133 refers) based on decisions by Ministers on the design features for the tax credit (1714 17-18, IR2018/083 and 1892 17-18, IR2018/084 refer) 8.As with any scheme involving expenditure of public money, there is a need to ensure the integrity of that expenditure. There are risks of inappropriate claims with an R&D tax credit. 9.This report responds to a request from Ministers for further advice around measures to ensure the integrity of the tax credit. It proposes certain adjustments to the definition of eligible R&D and seeks Ministers’ approval for their inclusion in the Discussion Document. It also responds to a request from Ministers at DEV for advice about the penalty rules that would apply to inappropriate claims under the tax credit. 10.This report has three sections. The first outlines the framework for the R&D tax credit and how this supports its integrity. The second proposes some particular refinements to the definition of R&D that was described in the technical design features report in order to support appropriate expenditure. The third outlines possible new penalties for the R&D tax credit to complement existing penalty rules. How the framework supports integrity 11.As noted in a previous report (1714 17-18, IR2018/083 refers), the objectives for designing an R&D tax credit are to provide easily accessible support to a broad range of business R&D, in a fiscally responsible way, while maintaining trust and confidence in the tax system. Each element of these objectives has integrity implications. 12.Providing easily accessible support means that the compliance burden associated with applying for the tax credit should be kept to a minimum. This requires the information requirements be consistent with normal business practices. 13.It also means there is as little ambiguity as possible as to what constitutes eligible R&D expenditure. This can be challenging as research and development, as it is used colloquially, doesn’t have a precise definition. Firms may consider they are doing R&D because a project is innovative and challenging but not comply with the definition within the legislation. Consequently, an important aspect of the definition of R&D is to favour clarity as to what qualifies and what doesn’t, even if – at the margin – this might disqualify some expenditure that is worthy of support. 14.It is also the case that government will learn with experience. There needs to be a flexible regulatory environment both to keep up with how R&D is changing for firms and to address what appears to be abuse of the scheme. Though stability of the scheme is an objective because this will be conducive to firms planning to undertake R&D, it has to be tempered by a commitment to adjust the legislation when warranted. In Confidence IR2018-132 Integrity within the RD Tax Credit Page 5 15.Applying the concept of fiscal responsibility to integrity is also challenging. On the one hand, increased expenditure as a result of firms undertaking more R&D is exactly what the scheme is aiming for. On the other hand, rapid increases in expenditure under the scheme may signal a proliferation of low value claims. 16.Perceptions that the scheme is rewarding claims that do not represent genuine R&D or that tax advisors are claiming too great a share of the expenditure will undermine the credibility of the scheme. 17.As stated in the Discussion Document, the Government is committed to monitoring the scheme and will have the ability to speedily identify and remedy issues that could compromise the integrity of the scheme. This sends a clear signal that the Government will maintain a focus on the scheme meeting its objectives and delivering value for money. 18.Being part of the tax system means that the tax credit will influence perceptions of that system. The tax system relies on voluntary compliance which in turn hinges on public confidence that the system is fair. An erosion of trust in one part of the system can undermine compliance in other parts of the tax system. 19.Inland Revenue will audit a selection of claims to test their validity and enforce compliance with the legislation. But this will not be a comprehensive safeguard so the transparency measures (discussed in 1892 17-18, IR2018/084) and integrity measures discussed in this report will be necessary adjuncts to support the integrity of the tax credit. Refinements to the definition of R&D 20.The technical design features briefing (1892 17-18, IR2018/084 refers) outlined the definition of R&D, including eligible and ineligible activities and expenditure categories. Since finalising that report, officials have completed a review of claims from the 2008 R&D tax credit. This has led us to propose certain refinements to the R&D definition. These have been incorporated into the draft Discussion Document that has been presented to Ministers as an attachment to briefing 2216 17-18, IR2018/133. 21.A common theme from the 2008 claims is that firms undertook R&D as part of a broader project. The claim was for all the project; business as usual expenses were included as R&D. The result was claims many times greater than what the IR investigators considered was genuine R&D. However, applicants successfully argued that their claims were permissible according to the letter of the law. 22.For the 2019 tax credit, officials therefore propose the following adjustments to the previous definition in order to provide greater clarity and to better target the credit to genuine R&D. Issue: Dual purpose R&D 23. Withheld under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 In Confidence IR2018-132 Integrity within the RD Tax Credit Page 6 24.Officials consider R&D can legitimately occur with respect to the operation of a manufacturing plant. However, the appropriate amount of eligible R&D expenditure would be the extra expenditure incurred over what it would have cost to manufacture the firm’s output without any R&D. This would isolate the actual cost of the R&D from the business as usual costs of the entity. 25.One way to address this would be to introduce a “to the extent” test. This would mean that where an activity has an R&D purpose and another purpose (in this case manufacturing output), the applicant would be required to apportion expenditure to R&D and the other purpose. 26.The problem with this test is that its application is fact specific. This will potentially lead to a high administration and compliance costs associated with establishing how much of an activity is for an R&D purpose and how much for another purpose. There is also a risk that it would not be as robust as expected and still allow recharacterisation. 27.Officials therefore propose a clearer rule that to be eligible, an activity must be for the sole purpose of R&D. This would mean that dual purpose activities would not be eligible R&D expenditure. In the example above, this rule would have excluded the costs of the manufacturing operation as eligible R&D expenditure because there would have been an additional purpose of producing output for sale. 28.This rule would not exclude genuine pre-production trials and manufacturing innovation. For example, if a production process is run solely to trial an innovative new method, this could be eligible. 29.Nonetheless, there is a risk of over-reach with this exclusion – that is valid R&D is excluded or firms incur additional costs in order to separate R&D from other activities. However, officials note the approach is consistent with the brightline (a clear boundary) test used elsewhere in the tax system. It is also similar to that adopted in other jurisdictions 1 . 30.On balance, officials consider the benefits arising from clarity are likely to outweigh the possible costs. The proposal will be highlighted in the Discussion Document so will be tested through consultation. 31.Proposal: To be an eligible activity for the R&D tax credit, the activity must be for the sole purpose of R&D. Issue: Eligibility where there is commercial consideration 32. 1 The US excludes research that is conducted after the beginning of commercial production; Ireland requires eligible expenditur e to be wholly and exclusively for the carrying on of the research; Australia requires a production activity to be for the dominant purpose of supporting R&D. Withheld under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 In Confidence IR2018-132 Integrity within the RD Tax Credit Page 7 The 2008 scheme had an “at risk” rule - firms claiming the tax credit had to bear the risk of the R&D expenditure. The intention was that the party commissioning the R&D would claim for the R&D tax credit. Often the investigators considered the genuine R&D was a small part of the project but the applicant successfully claimed for most of the project cost. The rules applying in 2008 did not enable claims to be confined to the genuine R&D portion. 33.Officials consider these claims are not consistent with the intention of the scheme and therefore propose to strengthen the “at risk rule” by incorporating a restriction that is included in the Australian R&D tax credit. This specifies that eligible expenditure does not include expenditure when the R&D performing entity or its associate had received or could reasonably be expected to receive consideration. 34.This rule, in conjunction with the restriction on dual purpose R&D, would mean that where a commissioned project included R&D, the commissioning party could claim the credit provided the R&D-related portion was identified as a separate project. If the R&D performing entity undertook extra R&D separate from what is was commissioned to undertake, it could claim a credit for that extra R&D. 35.Proposal: Eligible expenditure does not include expenditure when the R&D performing entity or its associate had received or could reasonably be expected to receive consideration. Software development 36.Software R&D will be an area of significant expenditure within the R&D tax credit. It accounted for approximately 40% of all tax credit claims under the 2008 credit and Australian officials indicated it makes up a higher proportion of expenditure under its R&D tax credit. 37.Officials consider that software development activities should qualify for the R&D tax credit where the activity meets the core or supporting R&D activity definitions. However, across OECD countries, mapping the definition of R&D onto software is an acknowledged difficulty. Inland Revenue investigators reported that when they investigated claims it was difficult to distinguish between R&D and standard software development. In itself, this means that re-examination of the 2008 rules is warranted. Also, technological change means that rolling over the 2008 rules relating to eligible software expenditure may not be appropriate. 38.The only limit placed on software under the 2008 credit was a $3 million cap for eligible expenditure on internal software development 2 . Internal software development was an area of particular concern for investigators of the 2008 claims. Officials are therefore considering whether internal software development should be excluded from eligible expenditure altogether, as is the approach in Australia. 39.Another approach adopted by other countries is to indicate, via guidelines or within legislation, the type of activities that would be eligible or ineligible for the tax credit. An example of the first could be developing new operating systems and of the second could be security testing. Officials consider that having a schedule of the software activities that would not qualify for the tax 2 This could be increased at the Minister of Finance’s discretion. In Confidence IR2018-132 Integrity within the RD Tax Credit Page 8 credit, with the ability to update that schedule more quickly than by primary legislation 3 , would make the tax credit more responsive to changes in the way software is developed and used. 40.Officials will continue to work on these issues. Having a robust approach to software will be important for the integrity of the R&D tax credit. It is anticipated that this work will be completed by May 2018. 41.Within the draft Discussion Document, this is flagged as an area where more work is being undertaken. Once more robust proposals have been developed, officials propose undertaking targeted consultation with relevant stakeholders. Penalty Rules 42.Voluntary compliance is the fundamental basis of the tax system. Administration of the R&D tax credit will also rely on voluntary compliance by taxpayers. Guidance and education will be provided to assist taxpayers understand what is eligible and make correct claims. 43.However, there is a risk with the R&D tax credit of applicants submitting incorrect claims. Penalties are one factor that will deter this. 44.Within the tax system, the shortfall penalties framework applies to all tax returns. This establishes a hierarchy of offenses from lack of reasonable care at the lowest level to tax evasion involving fraud at the highest. Appropriate penalties are associated with each level of offense, with civil penalties applying to the lower level offenses and criminal penalties applying to the higher level offenses. 45.Officials consider the shortfall penalties framework provides a suitable basis for applying penalties to incorrect R&D tax credit claims. However, we also consider the risks around R&D tax credits may be greater when advisors are paid on a contingency basis as this means they gain an incentive to inflate the claim. For this reason it is proposed that: i.where it is found that the R&D tax credit application demonstrates gross carelessness 4 or a more serious offense: and ii.if an external advisor has received or would have received a direct financial benefit from the claim (in the form of a fee contingent on the R&D tax credit), the advisor will be joint and severally liable (with the taxpayer) for the appropriate penalty (including repayment of tax shortfall and interest). 46.This proposal has been included in the draft Discussion Document. 47.There are two further elements which officials are investigating as possible extensions to the penalties regime. These are not covered in the draft Discussion Document. 3 Possible mechanisms could be Order in Council or Commissioner’s (of Inland Revenue) Determination 4 This means that the extension of the penalty would not apply if the taxpayer was found not to have exercised reasonable care In Confidence IR2018-132 Integrity within the RD Tax Credit Page 9 48.A risk is that advisors might promote template schemes 5 for claims under the R&D tax credit. Officials are doing further work to assess whether the current promoter penalties regime is adequate to cover this situation or should be revised. 49.Officials are also investigating whether there should be an over-ride to the standard secrecy provisions applying to tax records so that Inland Revenue could report a tax advisor associated with problematic claims to the appropriate professional body.

Jointly with Min Woods, you are taking the Cabinet paper Research and Development Tax Incentive Discussion Document to the DEV Cabinet Committee on 11 April. (Briefing 2757 17-18, IR2018/205 refers.) 6. You are seeking approval to publish the Discussion Document Fuelling Innovation to Transform our Economy that will underpin consultation on the proposed R&D tax credit. 7. The Discussion Document does not commit the Government to any policy, but it signals the parameters of Government's intended support for the research, science and innovation sector. 8. We anticipate that Minister Woods will take the lead in introducing the item and responding to questions about how this policy fits into the wider picture of Government support business innovation. This briefing therefore addresses tax-related issues. Tax-Related Questions that may be raised 9. Q: What's the difference between a tax incentive and a tax credit? 10. Minister Woods has requested the policy be referred to as a tax incentive because this provides a better description of the outcome sought. The instrument is a tax credit- that's the technical way it will be described in the tax legislation. 11. Q: How does the proposed rate of 12.5% compare with Australia's tax credit scheme? 12. The Australian scheme is more complex than what's proposed for New Zealand so it's not possible to make a simple comparison of the schemes' generosity. For small businesses, the Australian scheme is at a higher effective rate ( 16%) and is refundable, so is more generous. For large firms, the Australian scheme is at a lower effective rate (8.5%) and is not refundable, so is less generous. 13. Q: Is there a risk that the proposed defmition will exclude firms undertaking valuable innovation that we want to be eligible for the subsidy? 14. With the definition, we are trying to balance two competing objectives: • Including worthy R&D, while • Excluding business as usual being recharacterised as R&D. IR2018/: Speaking Notes for R&D paper at DEV Page3 In Confidence 15. The purpose of consultation is to get feedback on whether we've got that balance right. 16. In addition, it won't be the case that all worthwhile innovative activity will be eligible for the tax credit. The credit is focused on subsidising the acquisition and application of new knowledge because this is where market incentives are likely to be weakest for firms. For other innovative activities, the market provides good incentives so there is less justification for a government subsidy. 17. Q: Many small R&D performing firms will be in loss. Why is the tax credit not refundable right from the start? 18. Officials agree that ideally there should be support for R&D firms in loss. However, the risks associated with refundability are greater than with non-refundability. That is why we are proceeding carefully before introducing this feature. The issues that need to be worked through are set out at paragraph 32 of the Cabinet paper. These are substantial issues and there is not the time to work through them and get legislation enacted to meet the April 2019 start date for the credit. 19. Q: How can we make sure that this scheme is not rorted? 20. There are several ways we are ensuring the R&D tax incentive will support genuine R&D. • The definition of R&D, including the excluded activities and expenditure, will set out eligible expenditure and is designed to exclude business as usual expenditure. This definition incorporates lessons from the experience of the 2008 credit -for instance some of the additional exclusions that are being proposed are designed to defeat the types of claims that did not seem to be genuine R&D. • Because the tax credit will be part of the tax system, we will make sure the standard shortfall penalties within the tax system will apply to claims made for the tax credit. • Officials are investigating whether there are additional measures that need to apply to deter aggressive behaviour by tax advisors. 21. All these provide some measure of safeguard. However, they will not be an absolute protection. Therefore there will also be, in the legislation, a capacity to adjust the definition of R&D so that we can quickly remedy issues that suggest the scheme's integrity is being compromised.

Whi le I broadly support the measure, some of the thinking it is incorrect. Myt h: everything’s already available here The Minister’s media release of 1 May 2018 states “Large multinationals sell exactly the same products into our market without collecting GST”. The selection of goods available in New Zealand is vastly smaller than what’s available internationally. There are a huge number of goods that simply aren’t stocked in New Zealand, meaning local retailers aren’t disadvantaged when goods are purchased overseas. For example, in April 2018 alone, I searched for quality underwear in a size 22, special camera attachments for my iPhone and specific brands of shoes, and none of these items were available in New Zealand at any price or from any retailer. While I have no issues paying GST on goods I buy locally or internationally, it’s important not to perpetuate the myth that everything anyone could ever want can be purchased from a local retailer. Myth : Kiwis are motivated to shop on international websites based on price Serv ice in many stores is non-existent and I don’t wish to reward bad service by spending money in such stores. If I’m not going to receive personalised service, then I will purchase online either through a local or international website. To say Kiwis are shopping on international websites purely because of price is also a myth. As part of this process, retailers should take a good, hard look at their service levels and what they can do to retain customers. Man y thanks for the opportunity to comment.

Hi Thank you for your email of 2 May which raised the potential for double taxation under the Government’s proposals to collect GST on low-value imported goods in situations where multiple low- value goods are shipped together with a total value exceeding $400. To prevent GST being paid twice on low-value goods shipped in a single package, the discussion document suggests that the consumer would need to provide Customs with appropriate evidence that GST has already been paid on some or all of the goods in that package. For example, the consumer could retain proof of purchase (such as an invoice or an email from the supplier providing confirmation of their order) that shows they were charged GST by the supplier along with the amount of GST paid on the items. The Government is seeking feedback on whether this approach is appropriate, or whether other approaches for preventing or relieving double tax in these situations may be more workable. For example, Australia has a slightly different approach to supplies of multiple low-value goods. While offshore suppliers should charge GST at the point of sale on goods valued at or below the Australian low- value threshold of AU$1,000, there is an exception to this rule when the supplier has a reasonable belief that the goods will be grouped together and shipped in one package. However, in cases where the supplier is unable to form a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together but it turns out that the goods are in fact sent together in one package, Australian Customs will collect GST at the border if the total value is more than AU$1,000. In these situations, the consumer is required to seek a refund of the GST from the supplier. One point that we should probably clarify in relation to the proposals is that the value on the package should be exclusive of any GST charged by the supplier. So in your example where 40 items valued at $10 each are shipped together in a single package, the value on the package should be $400 instead of $460. But you are nevertheless correct that there is the potential for double taxation under the proposals, such as where two goods valued at $210 each are shipped together in a single package. I trust that this response is helpful. We would be very receptive to hearing any suggestions that you may have about ways to prevent or relieve double taxation in these situations, so please send in a submission if you have any thoughts on how the proposal in the discussion document could be improved. You can write a submission to us by replying to this email.

Just like 'trade me' in New Zealand, where people selling their own second hand items do not pay GST, people who are on e-bay who are not traders, but selling their own second hand items should not be expected to pay this tax. Nor should it be added at the border for second hand items over $400. An example of this may be a wedding dress - where it is likely to cost more than $400, but is used. Taxes have already been paid on this item in the original country when it was bought and sold the first time around.

However this monitoring work would rely heavily on the values and information we and other CBAFF members supplied in their low and high value entries. The issue with this is that while other integrated Courier Companies supply this information electronically it is currently not supplied by goods coming in via Post. This would give shippers more incentive to use this import method. Particularly from some countries into NZ. We note that IRD have raised a concern on consumers being taxed twice. Once at the border and once at the point of sale. We feel this was a moot point as on arrival the customs broker would be checking if GST had already been collected or not by looking at the commercial invoice. They always require a copy of the commercial invoice in order to complete a customs entry so this would already need to be requested. If GST was collected twice by mistake then this should be refunded by Customs and not the vendor. While large well known Vendors would look to do the right thing and refund their customers not all vendors would and it would not be fair to put the NZ customer at a disadvantage when it is the NZ public this initiative is designed to benefit. The ATO come to NZ and held several presentations this year to NZ eCommerce Exporters on the upcoming changes 1 st July 2017. This was extremely valuable for our customers and it would be highly recommended that IRD did the same in AU and other countries. We also feel that the data matching across NZ and AU mentioned is a great idea. Being able to register in AU or NZ and have the same codes work in both countries would be ideal as a lot of our shippers send to both AU and NZ already. It would also make it easier for those only sending to AU now also want to look at NZ. We are more than happy to discuss any of the above submission with either IRD or Customs further if required.

Summary of major points and recommendations: •BSNZ is strongly supportive of the Government's decision to collect GST from offshore suppliers of low-value goods. •We are supportive of an offshore registration supplier model for collecting GST on low value goods, because it is simple, straightforward, and in line with the Australian approach. •We are in favour of the earliest possible implementation date given the growth rate of online shopping. •We support a threshold for supplier registration being $60,000 revenue in a 12-month period. •We favour an approach that requires offshore suppliers to return GST on goods valued at or below $400, instead of the current de minimis of $60 of “duty”. This flat threshold will vastly simplify understanding and compliance. •In principle, we support the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges for goods valued at or below $400, but we are concerned that New Zealand-domiciled retailers will still suffer a competitive disadvantage in relation to duties on items below the $400 threshold. • We are strongly supportive of online marketplaces and “re-deliverers” being included in the offshore supplier model. PUB-025 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1. Since 2009 we have been researching the effects on the competitive position of our members as a result of the loophole in the application of the existing Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This has allowed New Zealand consumers to avoid paying GST on consumption of low value goods purchased from offshore online retailers. We have been advocating strongly that this has placed New Zealand bookshops and other small retailers in an unfair competitive position 2. The New Zealand Government’s GST legislation was designed to be universally applied and the small exceptions to this, including the original granting to NZ Customs of an exemption on collecting GST on goods below $400, saw the universality largely enforced. 4. However, the purchasing of low value goods from offshore online retailers has grown hugely in recent years and has grossly exposed the 1985 exemption when there was very little online retailing, if any. 3. The introduction of new legislation establishing an offshore supplier model that will require offshore online retailers, and related marketplaces, to collect GST on sales into New Zealand will effectively level the playing field for domestic retailers which currently have a 15 per cent price disadvantage. 4. The proposed offshore supplier model is a sensible and pragmatic solution, preferable to collection between the point of sale and delivery, or after delivery, as both would require entirely new systems to be devised. 5. Collection at the point of sale for physical goods is the natural extension of the system that was implemented successfully for services and intangibles in 2016. 6. We are supportive of the proposal as outlined in the discussion paper and our comments are summarised below: 7. For too long New Zealand based retailers, both in bricks and mortar stores and online, have been at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore online suppliers because of the outdated application of the 1985 legislation providing a loophole for online offshore retailers. This affects the New Zealand bookshops and other retailers in many ways, stunting their growth, and reduction in employment, and includes a detrimental flow-on effect to suppliers and the general commerce within a community.. 8. Bookshops in particular, are hubs of their communities and thus the cultural health of communities throughout New Zealand are put at risk if they cannot compete fairly. 9. We are in favour of the earliest possible implementation date. The systems that will be needed to implement the new legislation are largely in place as a result of the requirement of offshore online retailers supplying digital services, such as e-books, to collect GST. 10. As the discussion paper notes, it is difficult to estimate the total revenue foregone resulting from the non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods. This is because we don’t have good data about the volume and value of goods under the de minimis crossing our border. Customs has RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT estimated it at around $80 million in 2016 but our own research has suggested it could be much higher. 11. Research conducted by Victoria University for BSNZ in 2011 suggested that online sales by New Zealand retailers would increase substantially if offshore online retailers were required to collect GST on their sales into New Zealand. 12. The experience of applying GST to services and intangibles has shown that the actual revenue collected is much more than initially estimated. When the system was proposed it was estimated that the Government was foregoing approximately $40 million a year in revenue. Total revenue from the GST returns filed by offshore suppliers for the first twelve months was $113 million. 13. Before the implementation of offshore registration for services and intangibles there was also concern about uptake and non-compliance. That has also proved not to be a major issue and over 200 merchants have registered to date. It is noted that one major supplier of books into New Zealand, Abe Books (owned by Amazon) has already informed New Zealand bookshops that if they sell into Australia the price of their books will be increased by 10 per cent as Abe Books intends to comply with the Australian legislation as of 1 July, 2018 14. We favour the proposed approach that requires offshore suppliers to return GST on goods valued at or below $400, instead of the current de minimis of $60 of “duty” – this removes the complication of determining the product type and the country of origin in order to correctly apply a tariff. 15. We support the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges for goods valued at or below $400. This is a much easier threshold to understand and apply than the roving de minimis of $60 duty owing. 16. We are strongly supportive of online marketplaces and “re-deliverers” being included in the offshore supplier model. If they are excluded, there is a real risk that this will provide another loophole that allows GST to be avoided by offshore suppliers. We note in many cases in the United States where States have legislated to ensure that online retailers collect sales tax on previously exempted cross border sales, re-deliverers have not been included which has created another large loophole. 17. The Australian model, like that proposed for New Zealand, closes this loophole by ensuring that re-deliverers are required to pay GST. 18. We support the detailed proposals for registration and returns. Extending the existing GST registration system is a straightforward approach. New Zealand's existing GST registration system is already working well for foreign suppliers of digital services, and we see no reason why it won't also be effective for low value goods. 19. In the longer-term, we also support exploring joint-registration systems with other countries, and potentially a single harmonised GST system. The more that Australia and New Zealand can simplify and streamline border requirements, the better it will be for both businesses and consumers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 20. We would be happy to present our views in person and our submission is available to be made public if required. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Submission on “GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system” A government discussion document – published May 2018 Introduction The Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Incorporated (CBAFF) wishes to make a submission the discussion document published in May 2018 in respect to GST on low value imported goods. CBAFF CBAFF is the leading industry association representing customs brokers, freight forwarders and related service providers in New Zealand’s part of the international supply chain. The representation for such service providers also extends to their clients being importers and exporters. Those service providers and their clients are the parties subject to control of the New Zealand Customs Service, the Ministry for Primary Industries and Inland Revenue Department, together with other agencies such as the Ministry of Transport, Maritime New Zealand, Civil Aviation Authority, Environmental Protection Authority and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. CBAFF has a long history of engaging with the NZ border agencies on matters relating to the regulation of the passage of goods in and out of New Zealand and relating to wider trade policy issues such as the development and implementation of Free Trade Agreements and the development of cargo security initiatives. CBAFF is a member of FIATA – the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations and the Federation of Asia Pacific Aircargo Associations and works closely with other associations representing similar groups to those CBAFF represents. This includes Australian Federation of International Forwarders and Customs Brokers and Forwarders Council of Australia with whom CBAFF has worked collaboratively. In undertaking these roles, CBAFF draws upon the expertise of its members and their long history of representing service providers in the supply chain and those importers and exporters in the supply chain. The membership of CBAFF comprises some 110 companies delivering supply chain services for international trade to New Zealand and overseas companies. Supply chain services include: government agency compliance, arranging and/or providing transportation – international and domestic, warehousing / storage, PUB-027 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 2  repairs / maintenance,  reverse logistics and  order fulfilment. Submission presented by Rosemarie Dawson Executive Director Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Inc P O Box 34-149 Birkenhead Auckland 0626 June 2018 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 3 SUBMISSION In regards to the discussion document published May 2018 entitled “GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system”. 1. The proposal is certainly to be commended for creating “fairness” when viewed in relation to the New Zealand retail market. 2. The process for administering the scheme will be somewhat challenging for the Freight and Express industries and in this respect the proposal is short on specific operational detail. The proposal is specific in relation to registration. 3. Para 3.3. To differentiate at the point of sale between goods value at under or over NZ$400 is adding an unnecessary level of complexity to this system Based on the “broad based” GST system Companies who are GST registered should collect GST on all sales regardless of the value of the goods. On arrival consignments over $400 in value would be stopped at the Border for a high value entry clearance subject to any applicable duty, GST on CIF value and Transaction fees less GST paid at point of sale. 4. Para 3.6. We support the change of “de minimus” from $60 duty value to goods value. Based on “goods value” will make it easier and simpler to explain than the present “de minimus” based on duty value. The level of “de minimus” on goods value should reflect that of our main trading partners. Our recommendation would be for a de minimus of NZ$1000. 5. Para 3.8. We support the valuation being that of the value of the goods. 6. Para 3.10. We support the broad based GST system with few exceptions. 7. Para 3.12-3.15. The supply of multiple low value goods is likely to create some headaches and an unnecessary level of complexity. If Point 3 above is adopted then no further action required. If point 3 is not adopted then the differentiation in value between sales under or over NZ$400 will created additional costs for overseas suppliers. 8. Para 3.17-3.19 Instances where multiple low value goods may have had GST applied at point of sale that should be subject to Border clearance should have provision at time of Border clearance for any point of sale GST to be offset against collection at the Border. This could be actioned by way of a credit claim in the Border clearance and supported by evidence of GST paid at point of sale. 9. Para 3.17. What appropriate evidence is likely to be acceptable? This potentially will bottleneck the flow of consignments through the Postal system and Express Couriers which would be counter-productive to the system designed to expedite the collection of GST. 10. Para 3.24 We question the rationale behind exempting supplies to GST registered business. Para 1.6 states that New Zealand’s GST system is a broad based consumption tax, based on the destination principle. This means that all goods and services should be subject to GST when they are consumed in New Zealand. Current trading within NZ business to business attracts GST with provision to claim inputs. For simplicity at the point of sale there should not be another layer of distinction relating to GST registered businesses. 11. If however there is to be a distinction between GST registered business’ then in relation to Para 3.24-3.25 concern is expressed around the business to business exclusion of GST based on the supply of a NZ business number. A NZ business number does not necessarily mean that the RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT CBAFF submission on GST on Low Value Imported Goods June 2018.docx Page 4 business is registered for GST. We would suggest that supply of a GST registration number (para 3.25) is implicit upon the business as a declaration of their GST status. 12. Whilst creating “fairness” for the NZ retail market it implies “unfairness” in that it only applies to offshore suppliers who voluntarily choose to register. Suppliers who don’t register but supply items under the new de minimus of NZ$400 will provide a benefit to consumers given the new “de minimus” 13. At the Border there will be difficulty in distinguishing between items/suppliers where GST has been applied, items/suppliers who are not registered and therefore no GST collected, supplies to GST registered entities where no GST need be applied and GST on multiple value consignments where GST has and has not been applied in relation to the value of the goods. 14. Concern is expressed that the proposal is around the collection of GST (revenue) on low value goods but of equal or greater importance is the recognised pathway for biosecurity risk. 15. Concern is expressed in respect to liabilities for the Brokers involved where both Administrative Penalties and Infringement Notices (as per the new Customs and Excise Act commencing October 2018). 16. Concern is expressed around the resources needed to administer the proposal. Already both Customs and MPI resources are stretched to deal with normal commercial importations without the added volumes of administering low value consignment. As an industry we would be gravely concerned if the costs involved were then reflected over imports with neither Customs nor MPI benefiting from the Import Transaction Fee and Biosecurity System Entry Levy. ENDS RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2 If GST is to be collected, under the pretence that this levels the playing field for New Zealand retailers, then there are better, less risky ways to do this than to place the burden on overseas entities that have absolutely no reason to comply. Collection at the border for all parcels would still allow this tax revenue to be collected, and an online system for payment and release of parcels would easily mitigate the administrative costs involved. This is just one of many potential solutions. With experience in retail myself, I have seen local distributors decide that the New Zealand market is too small, with sales too low, to warrant dealing with it. Again, I stress that there is a huge risk that international retailers, with no obligation to go to the hassle and expense of collecting GST for the New Zealand government, might also decide that the country isn’t worth the hassle. Without a hint of humour or irony, I sincerely hope that you reconsider this approach, as I really do need clothes to wear.

We agree in principle with the proposals outlined in the discussion document. New Zealand’s GST system operates based on the destination principle, which charges GST on all goods and services supplied in/to and consumed in New Zealand. Measures that address the inconsistent imposition of GST between goods purchased locally, and goods purchased and imported from overseas, will strengthen New Zealand’s GST base. However, while the proposals may have merit from a pure policy perspective, the final design of the proposal will be critical in order to ensure the rules are workable for those affected and achieve the desired outcome in the most efficient way. We therefore strongly urge that officials seriously consider the compliance impact the proposals will have on those who are captured by the rules. Our submission provides feedback on topics as requested in the discussion document. We also note further areas that we consider requires official’s considerations. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise specified (the Act). Electronic Marketplaces Electronic marketplaces (EMs) are currently required to register and remit GST on the supply of remote services to a person resident in New Zealand. The discussion document proposes that the scope of this rule should be extended to incorporate the supply of low-value imported goods (low-value goods). In our view, a straight extension of the rule does not allow for the array of different business models that operate within the EM environment for low-value goods. The key point to note is that the business models between low-value goods and remote services can differ significantly, therefore it is possible that the existing EM model would impose entirely different challenges for those that operate an EM that contains low-value goods. In short, there is a spectrum of EMs and there may not be a “one size fits all” solution. PUB-029 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 For example, some EMs merely facilitate the interaction between suppliers and consumers - they do not process any payments or handle goods. EMs who operate in such fashion would be required to significantly adjust their business structure to comply with the proposed rules. The proposal should not impose unfair burdens on or generate excessive compliance costs for offshore businesses as officials pursue an efficient and administrable system. The United Kingdom uses a joint-and-several liability (JSL) approach to the collection of VAT on the supply of goods made within EMs. The JSL rules hold EMs liable for GST where the EM knew or should have known that the offshore supplier should have been GST-registered, but was not. In this approach, the EM plays an active role in policing the GST registration status of offshore suppliers within their marketplace without the need to substantially adjust their business model. Other features of the JSL approach in the UK includes the lack of a turnover threshold for registration, and the ability for an offshore supplier to appoint an agent or ‘tax representative’ to handle their UK VAT obligations. The JSL approach is an alternative to the current proposed EM model which could reduce the compliance burden on EM operators. We therefore submit that further consideration is given to the proposals concerning EMs. We note that the proposals around EMs should, at a minimum, include the ability for an EM to use a New Zealand agent to comply with their obligations. This would replicate the current rules that apply for remote services and can be a good alternative for EMs to manage their compliance costs. We understand that officials are currently reviewing various options in relation to EMs and PwC NZ will continue to liaise with officials on these options. We will also liaise with officials on the definition of “electronic marketplace”. Re-deliverers We understand and appreciate the need to include re-deliverers within the proposal. The exclusion of such businesses from the system could present the situation where consumers may opt to purchase goods via a re-deliverer in order to avoid paying New Zealand GST. However, as with EMs, it is important that the final design of the proposal take into account the business model of re-deliverers. A clear understanding of what information and knowledge re- deliverers have in terms of their customers and the goods they process is required to ensure the final design of the proposals can be incorporated easily into existing business processes. Australia’s “Reasonable Belief” Exception Under the Australian model, an offshore supplier who reasonably believes that the supply of low value goods, when combined together surpasses AU $1000, will be grouped and sent together, can shift the imposition of GST from the point of sale to the time at which the consignment arrives at the Australian border. This is referred to as the “reasonable belief” exception. Feedback has been sought as to whether the exception should be incorporated into New Zealand’s rules. We believe that this is an unnecessary measure that if introduced would increase compliance costs for offshore suppliers as well as create uncertainty for consumers. This is because consumers may get confused as to whether GST had been charged on goods at the time of supply. As such, on balance we do not support the introduction of a “reasonable belief” exception. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 However, it will be important that a simple process is available to the New Zealand consumer to demonstrate GST has been paid where a consignment is stopped at the border. This will go to the overall customer experience for the New Zealand consumer, therefore it is important that the process needs to be simple so that the process is not seen as an additional barrier to the purchase of goods. De Minimis Threshold – Definition and Value We welcome a change to the way in which the de minimis is defined. The current definition has historically caused a significant amount of confusion for consumers importing goods. Defining the de minimis in terms of the value of the goods themselves, rather than the dutiable component of the goods, will bring clarity and certainty to consumers and offshore suppliers as to the tax treatment of imported goods. In our view, the proposed $400 threshold value is appropriate at this stage and the threshold could be reviewed two-three years after the rules are introduced. This value complements the existing operation of processes conduct by Customs at the border, while collecting tax revenue currently foregone. Valuation Methodology The valuation methodology for determining whether GST is required to be charged on a supply of goods has been raised by officials as an area requiring further consideration. We agree that this is a critical concept. Any resulting valuation methodology should be easy for offshore suppliers to understand and comply with. The issue is exemplified by the sale of a low-value good with an associated cost (e.g. shipping charge) which causes the total amount paid by the consumer to be more than $400. For customs valuation purposes, associated costs (such as costs of shipping) are included in determining value. Therefore, there is some merit in using the same methodology to reduce complexity. Furthermore, by the time New Zealand initiates an offshore supplier registration system, offshore suppliers who supply low-value goods into Australia would have had 15 months of experience with the Australian model. This model requires the deduction of freight and insurance costs in determining if goods fall above or below the de minimis threshold. When goods fall below the threshold, GST is imposed on the full transaction amount – an amount inclusive of freight and insurance costs (i.e. a ‘customs value’ approach’). It would be most efficient for offshore suppliers if New Zealand were to follow the same approach as Australia. We note that in the discussion document, the value of the goods in the various examples generally include shipping costs. It would be useful to have the valuation methodology specifically clarified to ensure there is no confusion as to the value of the goods to which New Zealand GST applies to. Transitional measures We note that the transitional measures that were included within the remote services rules helped ensure a smooth transition into the new rules. For example, the six-month transitional period for the first return provided those affected with sufficient time to adjust their systems and processes in order to determine and comply with their GST obligations. We strongly submit that the transitional measures that applied for the remote services rules apply to low-value goods also. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 196444\_6 Commission and fees If offshore sellers, re-deliverers, or EMs have a GST liability, clarity is required in relation to the GST treatment of agency fees paid by principal to agent due to the fact that in some case agents (or intermediaries) may have a GST liability on the sale depending on the final shape of the rules and concessions.

BusinessNZ took the opportunity to submit on this issue in 2015 via the GST: Cross- Border Services, Intangibles and Goods discussion document. There we outlined our vie ws on a range of issues relating to the collection of GST on imported goods and services, including our conclusion that any changes should remain in line with New Zealand’s overall GST system, at present one of the cleanest in the world. BusinessNZ’s principled approach In principle, BusinessNZ supports the Government in charging GST on imported goods, as well as on digital products and other services. As with GST on goods and services domestically, GST on offshore purchases should be broad and consistent. However, we have always been conscious of the need to distinguish between such a requirement and the situation where the practical and compliance implications for those who collect the tax outweigh the revenue collected. Ultimately, what the Government should aim for is an enhanced GST system that best meets the needs of the three key interested parties, business, consumers and government. Any solution meeting the needs of only 1 or 2 of these groups will not provide a long-term policy answer and will inevitably lead to ongoing revisions that create further distortions and compliance issues. BusinessNZ believes the various moving parts need to be balanced. There is a fine line between ensuring GST collected from offshore purchases meets general compliance requirements and minimises tax base erosion and ensuring the collection requirement does not, at the same time, create unintended consequences that effectively damage JacksonStone House 3- 11 Hunter Street PO Box 1925 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Tel: 04 496-6555 Fax: 04 496-6550 www.businessnz.org.nz RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT New Zealand’s economic base. One way to make certain these objectives are met is by avoiding extreme measures and instead taking a pragmatic and reasonable approach. Getting offshore companies on board Chasing the ‘last dollar’ will invariably lead to increased compliance and transaction costs, which could fall heavily on offshore suppliers exporting items to New Zealand. For some, the increased costs will simply mean New Zealand becomes a ‘no-go zone’, preventing both New Zealand consumers and businesses from purchasing items they want. And New Zealand businesses could experience reciprocal problems when looking to export their own goods if this country is perceived as one where transacting goods across borders is difficult. We strongly agree it is important to create a level playing field to enable New Zealand businesses to compete with offshore suppliers. However, from a broader perspective we would not want the Government to think the review will provide a panacea for all competitiveness woes. Acknowledging New Zealand’s place in the world In a global context, New Zealand is a very small market, whether measured using variables such as total GDP or the value of imports and exports. We are also a distant market and therefore have become a country whose efforts to reduce trade barriers have provided at least a comparative advantage over countries and regions with far larger economic clout but with trade barriers in place. When looking to create a better balance between the obligations of domestic and offshore suppliers, the Government should not make GST policy changes that lead those suppliers to view New Zealand as somewhere to be avoided from a terms of trade point of view - possibly due to significant compliance procedures associated with the export of goods or services. Overly complicated and onerous GST measures might more negatively a ffect New Zealand, compared with similar arrangements offshore, simply, as a small market in the global economy, because of existing impediments. Simplicity of capturing at source In our 2015 submission, BusinessNZ favoured the option of identifying those enterprises which deal with the bulk of sales to New Zealand, requesting they collect GST on behalf of the New Zealand Government. We believed identifying the main players would be relatively easy and it would not take a sizeable number of enterprises to ensure the greatest amount of revenue was collected. Therefore, we are pleased to see that of the three options considered in the current discussion document, the Government has decided to proceed with the ‘at the point of sale’ option, whereby suppliers would be required to register for, collect and return GST (“offshore supplier registration”). Overall, we believe the offshore supplier registration option is the best way forward, and should be introduced. Primary Recommendation: In principle, the offshore supplier registration system should proceed. 2 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT But notwithstanding our primary recommendation that of the options considered, the offshore supplier registration system should proceed, we also wish to take the opportunity to outline a recent concern that has arisen across the Tasman. The Government needs to be cognisant of this problem when developing the GST policy further. Mindful of learning from offshore experiences In relation to the point raised above regarding getting offshore companies on board, paragraph 4.4 in the discussion document points out that “For some suppliers, the compliance costs of registering and returning GST may outweigh the revenue collected in supplying low-value goods to New Zealand customers. As far as possible any new rules should be designed in a way that does not pose a barrier to trade with New Zealand as this could reduce market competition and consumer choice”. BusinessNZ agrees. In fact, we do not have to look far abroad to see the current state of play in Australia, given the country is going through its own major review of the GST issue. BusinessNZ agrees the best way forward is to require offshore suppliers to register, collect and return GST on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers where the value of the goods is $400 or less. However, recent developments in Australia show this change process as not perhaps as straightforward as first believed. As paragraph 2.21 of the discussion document points out, the Australian Parliament has enacted similar legislation to that proposed for New Zealand, namely that offshore suppliers of goods register for GST in Australia and collect and return GST on goods supplied to Australian consumers valued at or below AU$1000. Suppliers must do this if the total supplied to Australia exceeds the AU$75,000 threshold for GST registration. The requirement comes into force on 1 July 2018. However, in late May, Amazon announced that from 1 July it would block Australians from buying from its international e-commerce websites and restrict them to a smaller local platform. While other significant offshore suppliers such as Ebay and Alibaba have confirmed post the Amazon announcement that they would not be blocking Australian users, the fact that one of the largest suppliers of goods in the world has taken this step means there is nothing to stop other major suppliers following a similar path, especially if the challenge of implementing the tax is greater than the size of the market supplied. Given the New Zealand population is roughly 20 percent the size of Australia’s, our pulling power as a market puts us in an even more delicate position. At the very least, BusinessNZ believes there are two steps IRD needs to take before looking to implement an offshore supplier registration system. First, it needs to assess exactly where Australia sits in relation to the collecting and remitting of GST in terms of major international suppliers other than Amazon. We do not consider lack of agreement from a few offshore suppliers should prevent this new regime from proceeding. However, if some of the largest suppliers to the New Zealand market are blocking customers, then the trade-off between the three interested parties discussed above comes into play, as the benefit of revenue collection may be superseded by loss of consumer choice due to an adverse offshore business reaction. Second, with regard to the above, we note, on page 5, that what is proposed would apply from 1 October 2019.

We have also had the benefit of discussing the proposal with officials to feed in our thoughts at a concept stage and appreciate the time and effort made by officials to engage with us. Overall we believe the proposals are sensible, timely and appropriate. A fundamental principle of GST is that it should tax the consumer at the place of consumption, in the simplest and easiest way possible. A summary of our submissions is set out at the end of this document and our detailed submissions are in chapters 3, 4 and 5. In our view the proposed rules should be seen as an interim step to an eventual technological solution. We assume that, in time, technology will have advanced sufficiently for Governments to receive information about the nature and value of goods in a timely manner and to be able to deal with the tax aspects in an easy and low cost way. We urge officials to continue to investigate and develop technology solutions that will reduce compliance costs for businesses, Government and consumers. In addition, we strongly believe that the proposals point to the need for a publicly searchable register of New Zealand businesses and their GST status. This would provide independent comfort to offshore suppliers looking for reassurance that their customer is GST registered. A searchable register would also be invaluable to New Zealand businesses and to Customs for compliance checks. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) provides a searchable register for the NZBN, but this register does not include GST registration status. In our view, that register should include GST registration status, or a separate register should be introduced by Inland Revenue that provides information on a business’s GST registration.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 7 General comments Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Discussion Document and provide feedback. We have also had the benefit of discussing the proposal with officials at a concept stage and appreciate the time and effort made by officials to engage with us. Overall we support the proposal to introduce the measures outlined in the Discussion Document as an interim measure. We assume that, in time, technology will have advanced sufficiently for governments to receive information about the nature and value of goods in a timely manner and be able to deal with the tax aspects in a simple and low cost manner, as well as provide a more comprehensive collection of the consumption tax. The Tax Working Group’s conclusion was that these proposals should proceed because practical concerns meant that the alternative options (either taxing between the point of sale and delivery, or after delivery) were not feasible in the short term. Governments should continue to investigate advances in technology so that when the practical concerns of the alternative collection options have been addressed then Government can introduce the alternatives. The “expanded vendor” registration model is not a perfect solution. The model will result in some goods not being subject to GST – such as when the goods have a value of less than $400 and the vendor is not GST registered (even if they should be). Thus, the proposals still leave a significant hole in the collection of GST on imported goods. Notwithstanding the above, in our view, the “expanded vendor” collection model currently has the greatest potential to provide an efficient and effective solution to the issue of taxation of low-value imported goods. We support the proposal as an interim step for a vendor model that also leverages the scale, aggregating and centralising power of electronic distribution platforms and intermediaries in the supply chain where appropriate. We acknowledge that expansion to include further entities will include some complexity and we discuss this further in chapter 3 of our submission. The measures proposed will have the effect of aligning the rules for goods with the rules for services, already introduced. (Although we note that this is not the case if the goods are consumer-to-consumer supplies). Moreover, the proposed measures are very similar to those introduced in Australia and are also broadly similar to the model used in the EU. This will promote ease of business for multinationals who are looking to register in many countries at once. The Australian rules have only just come into effect and New Zealand should be looking to Australia to see where their measures have been effective and where we should look to modify our proposals to deal with issues encountered. The similarity with overseas jurisdictions will also be invaluable as technology develops further and a wider range of measures become available to collect tax on cross-border sales of goods. We believe the measures outlined in the Discussion Document will eventually be superseded by a technology solution, likely involving international co-operation. Therefore, it is imperative that New Zealand develop a new regime that takes international norms into account as much as is RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

We believe that the proposals as outlined strike an appropriate balance between these two considerations.

It is consistent with GST policy to continue to treat fine metal as exempt from GST and thus not subject to the proposed rules, although we agree with the comments in the Discussion Document that it is unlikely that many will seek to import fine metal with a value below the threshold of $400. In addition, we agree with the proposal to exclude alcohol and tobacco products from the proposed rules. These products have their own regime and are subject to additional taxes for public health reasons. It would not be sensible to include these products within what is intended to be a simplified regime. In addition, we note that this is in line with the rules in Australia. Supplies of multiple low-value goods We agree with the proposal to treat a consignment of goods that is above the threshold as being subject to the current rules and taxed at the border. This rule is consistent with current practice and is sensible where the supplier is aware of the total value of the goods supplied. In addition this approach is consistent with the rules to be implemented in Australia. Preventing double taxation We agree that double taxation needs to be prevented. However, significant work needs to be done to ensure that an efficient process is applied. The current proposal is to allow a consumer to contact Customs with evidence that GST has already been paid on the goods. Officials will need to give thought to how to make this process as streamlined as possible. The proposal in the Discussion Document sounds time consuming and bureaucratic. One suggestion would be to include a prior notification procedure. The vendor could notify Customs that they are sending goods where GST has already been charged. Customs needs to develop trusted vendor or documentation protocols which allow easy Customs clearance so that the focus is on audit activity rather than clearance at the border. Another option would be to allow consumers to notify Customs prior to their goods coming into the country that they are expecting a shipment of goods with GST paid. This procedure would also allow Customs to check when the goods arrive and allow the consumer to receive goods in a timely manner.

Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 11 Ultimately we expect that a technology solution is needed but understand that this may not be possible in the short-to-medium term. Therefore, we recommend that officials consider one of the options above. “Reasonable belief” exemption The Discussion Document asks for feedback on whether New Zealand should adopt Australia’s “reasonable belief” exception. The exception “means that if the supplier reasonably believes that the multiple goods will be grouped together and shipped in one consignment, GST can be charged at the border instead of by the offshore supplier” (paragraph 3.20). Feedback from our members in public practice suggests that this would be useful for their clients. Option to tax If a “reasonable belief” exemption is not adopted, it would be of use to offshore suppliers to have an “option to tax” – that is, if the supplier is not sure whether the goods will be shipped in one consignment or not, they could have an option to charge GST. If it is subsequently discovered that the goods are shipped in a larger consignment and GST is charged at the border, the consumer could use the process proposed at paragraph 3.17 to prevent double taxation. Returns and refunds We support the proposal in paragraph 3.23 of the Discussion Document. The proposed rule is that, when an offshore supplier issues a refund, they would be able to adjust their output tax in a subsequent GST return. There would be a time limit for the adjustment based on the input tax rules. This rule is necessary as most offshore suppliers will be using simplified (pay-only) GST returns and are not able to claim input tax credits. Supplies to consumers and GST-registered businesses We support the proposal to include only supplies to consumers within the scope of the new rules. We also support the proposal to allow an offshore supplier to zero rate the supply to a New Zealand registered person. We discuss both of these in more detail below. Identification of New Zealand consumers It is proposed that a supply will be treated as being made to a New Zealand consumer if there is a New Zealand delivery address. This is appropriate as it is highly likely that the consumption of RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 12 the goods will be in New Zealand. In addition, this is a straightforward test and thus has low compliance costs for suppliers. Supplies to businesses excluded We support the proposal to exclude supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. There is currently no revenue leakage provided the business is fully taxable and therefore we do not believe that there is a need to include these supplies within the scope of the regime. There will be an increase in compliance costs for some overseas suppliers, who will need processes in place to identify business suppliers. However, the exclusion of supplies to GST registered recipients from the rules places an incentive on the recipient to inform the supplier of their registration status. This is because, if the business is inadvertently charged GST, the New Zealand business will need to obtain a Tax Invoice from the supplier. The Tax Invoice will need to comply with the requirements in section 24 of the GST Act. Obtaining a Tax Invoice is likely to be difficult and the process time consuming. It will be simpler for the New Zealand business recipient to simply supply its IRD number to the overseas vendor. This incentive to provide an IRD number increases the likelihood that the GST charge is accurate. The introduction of these proposals should also give Government an opportunity to review the requirements in section 24 and consider whether the advances in technology mean that certain fields are no longer necessary. In addition, we suggest that the threshold for the simplified tax invoice be raised. We agree with the comments in the Discussion Document that the proposed exclusion may mean some offshore suppliers are outside the regime entirely (i.e. those which supply only to GST registered businesses), which we agree is desirable. Rules for identifying business-to-business supplies We agree with the proposed rules for identifying business-to-business suppliers. In particular, we support the proposal to allow the recipient to use the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN). The MBIE website has a searchable register which allows anyone to confirm independently that the NZBN is correct. Officials should consider extending the publication function. It is our view that Government should provide a searchable register that shows a business’s name, GST registration status and IRD number (if GST registered). If there are concerns with making a registered person’s IRD number publicly available, Government should consider using the NZBN for GST purposes. Our members have a strong desire for an independent process that would enable them to verify another business’s GST registration status. This function is available in Australia and generally works well. The argument is even stronger for offshore suppliers. Offshore businesses that RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 13 supply goods and services online will generally have less direct interaction with their customers compared to those who sell domestically. In the case of suspected fraud, it would be most helpful if the supplier could search a register to check if a business was legitimate and was in fact GST registered. Ability to zero-rate business-to-business supplies We support the proposal to allow an offshore supplier to zero rate the supply to a New Zealand registered person. It will allow an offshore supplier to claim input tax if they have incurred costs in New Zealand which were subject to GST. Allowing an option to zero rate is also consistent with the rules in section 8 of the GST Act, which essentially allow an overseas supplier making supplies to New Zealand GST registered recipients to opt into New Zealand’s registration system. The proposed rule is also consistent with the rule for offshore suppliers of services. Reverse charge for GST registered businesses We agree with the proposal to require a New Zealand registered recipient to return GST where the goods will also be used for exempt or private purposes. We question whether this should be more accurately characterised as a change of use adjustment. We assume that a change of use adjustment would be more accurate and more similar to domestic purchases. We still see a place for a reverse charge where the goods will be used wholly for non-taxable purposes and the purchaser has incorrectly provided an IRD number and is not actually GST registered, or has incorrectly claimed that the goods will be used fo r business purposes. New Zealand businesses being inadvertently charged GST The easiest and most painless way for a New Zealand business to recover inadvertently charged GST is to claim the GST as input tax in its next GST return. The proposal in the Discussion Document is to allow a New Zealand business to claim the GST in its return, provided the recipient is able to obtain a full Tax Invoice from the supplier. We believe this is a good intermediate step between allowing an input tax claim (low compliance cost) and requiring the business to obtain a refund from the supplier (generally higher in compliance cost). We recognise that officials will see a possible revenue risk in allowing an input claim without evidence that the supplier has paid the corresponding output tax and thus we support the proposals as drafted.

We strongly support the proposal to remove the tariffs and cost recovery charges on low-value goods for the reasons outlined in paragraph 3.46 of the Discussion Document.

Formed in Australia.

This will be easily understood because New Zealand currently has a registration threshold of $60,000. We believe having a common registration threshold that is easily understood will make it more likely that offshore suppliers will comply. Moreover, there has been comment in the New Zealand media about the role of the proposals in “levelling the playing field” for New Zealand retailers. Requiring the same dollar value registration threshold will enhance the credibility of the proposals as establishing a level playing field. In reality, the threshold applies only to supplies made to consumers in New Zealand, whereas a domestic supplier must take into account total worldwide supplies, to both businesses and consumers, so domestic and offshore suppliers do not in fact have the same registration threshold. Nevertheless we agree that the New Zealand Government should be careful not to impose a barrier to trade and thus should not look to impose a compliance burden on an offshore supplier unless it will result in a revenue benefit. We note that where a non-resident vendor exceeds the $60,000 threshold it is unlikely that they will automatically register for GST in New Zealand. Rather, it is likely that only those vendors who have material supplies of goods into New Zealand will register. This is an inherent issue with the vendor registration model. While it is addressed partly by the proposed “marketplace” rules, they do not provide a full solution, hence our comments above that these proposals should be seen as only an interim step. Special rules for marketplaces and re-deliverers Marketplaces The Discussion Document proposes that a marketplace be required to register when:  customers would normally consider the marketplace to be the supplier; and  this is reflected in the contractual arrangements. Paragraph 4.10 of the Discussion Document suggests three criteria for determining when the marketplace be required to register (i.e. when the two criteria above are met). They are when the marketplace:  authorises the charge to the customer;  authorises deliver of the goods to the customer; or  sets any of the terms and conditions of the transaction. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 17 These criteria are very similar to those in the Australian rules. By way of background, many popular New Zealand sites are more akin to online classifieds. Australian officials consider online classifieds to be outside the scope of the “marketplace” rules and we agree with this treatment. One of New Zealand’s most popular e-commerce sites is a listing platform, allowing vendors to advertise and sell their goods. Offshore vendors may also use the platform to list their goods. Goods purchased on the platform are not purchased from the platform itself, or from a related company. The platform supplies the vendor with the means to list the goods and charges a listing fee (either before or after sale). The platform is similar to a mall operator such as Westfield, in that it provides a shop front for retailers and charges a fee to the retailers, but is not responsible for, or involved in, the sales to the consumers. Taking this example, we assume that these platforms would qualify as online classifieds and would not meet the definition of a “marketplace”. At the other end of the spectrum are sites such which allow consumers to purchase through a range of channels. They supply goods directly to New Zealand consumers but also hosts other suppliers on its website. The other suppliers also sell the goods directly to consumers. Some of the other suppliers are part of the same group of companies. Others are independent retailers. Taking this example, we assume that such a overseas platform would qualify as a “marketplace”. The definition will need to make clear for which supplies:  The offshore platform is the seller in its own right;  The offshore platform must return GST as a “marketplace”; and  The offshore platform does not need to return GST because the seller is registered separately for New Zealand GST and is required to charge New Zealand GST on the sale. A practical concern is that it is not always clear to consumers whether they are making a payment to the platform or the underlying supplier. Therefore, in our view, the criteria should not require customer knowledge of the contractual arrangements. We understand that the criteria in paragraph 4.10 are very similar to those used in Australia. However, from discussions with our members it would seem that the Australian rules do not always allow the parties to distinguish between each of the scenarios easily. One example is the criterion relating to authorisation of payment. We understand that some suppliers of online classifieds provide a service whereby the platform may hold the payment until the goods are received. This service provides protection for supplier and recipient. However, we do not believe that offering this service makes the platform the supplier. Accordingly, in that situation, the platform should not be required to remit the GST on the goods supplied. We request specific clarification on this point and to have further consultation if a different view is proposed. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 18 The Discussion Document states (at paragraph 4.12) that underlying suppliers would still be required to register for supplies made to New Zealand residents not connected with the marketplace. A key question is whether the overseas supplier would need to take into account supplies made through the marketplace or whether the registration requirement would exist only where the supplies made outside the marketplace exceed the registration threshold. We assume that supplies through a marketplace are excluded when determining whether the threshold is met for direct supplies but believe this must be specifically clarified. In addition, it will be crucial to know when a supply is considered to be “through the marketplace” and when it is not. The Discussion Document states (paragraph 4.13) that “the compliance costs for these smaller suppliers fall away when the requirement to register and return GST is shifted to the marketplace”. We would like to know whether Government has evidence of this. The marketplace rules remove registration, GST return and payment from the supplier. However, there will be other compliance costs between the marketplace and the supplier (e.g. complex reimbursement arrangements) which would mean that the overall compliance costs for the supplier have not reduced overall. Re-deliverers We agree that it is sensible to require a re-deliverer to register for and charge New Zealand GST where the original supplier has no knowledge that the goods are to be shipped to New Zealand. We understand that most re-deliverers require the consumer to provide information about the type and value of the goods to be shipped. We assume that re-deliverers will be able to alter their systems to charge GST to the consumer in addition to their current costs. However, we recommend that officials check with re-deliverers to ensure that this is workable. (We note that the inclusion of re-deliverers in the model means that there is a consumer GST model being applied – although aggregated to a re-deliverer – and wonder whether this suggests that a consumer model is achievable). We support the proposal that freight forwarders and courier companies, who are simply carrying out a delivery function, not be caught by the rules for re-deliverers. However, the rules will need to provide a clear distinction between a re-deliverer as described in the proposals, and a simple freight forwarder. Moreover, the rules should provide a distinction between a re-deliverer and a finance-type company such as lay-buy or afterpay. We understand that these companies may pay the merchant directly for the goods and arrange for the merchant to ship the goods to New Zealand. Thus the payment company would meet the second of the criteria listed at paragraph 4.19 because it is purchasing the goods on behalf of the consumer. In our view, it would be more logical for the retailer to return the GST in that situation rather than the payment company. We assume from the comments in paragraph 4.11 of the Discussion RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 19 Document that officials are aware of this issue and intend that the rules will be drafted so that it is the retailer who accounts for GST rather than the payment company. We mention the issue here because there is a risk that a payment company could fall out of the “marketplace” rules yet be required to account for GST as a “re-deliverer” and we do not believe this would be a desirable result. Simplified registration system We agree with the proposal to allow overseas suppliers of goods to use the simplified registration system already in place. We understand from our members that this system is working well (although we note that our members have said that their clients generally find the New Zealand GST registration process to be straightforward by comparison with other countries). Consequence for non-residents registered to claim input tax At present, non-residents are able to claim New Zealand GST input tax on costs incurred in making their overseas supplies. However, a condition of a non-resident being able to claim GST for their overseas supplies is that the non-resident does not make taxable supplies in New Zealand. If these non-residents are subject to the non-resident supplier rules, the GST refund rules would need to be modified to allow GST to be claimed for expenses relating to their overseas supplies. Filing periods We strongly support the proposal to allow offshore suppliers to file quarterly returns. This is consistent with the EU filing requirements. Thus it will reduce compliance costs for large international organisations who file indirect tax returns across the world.

Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. 21 Enforcement, compliance and penalties We agree with the comments in the Discussion Document that ensuring that the rules are workable and easy to comply with will be the best way to ensure voluntary compliance. Measures to bolster compliance We strongly support the proposal to explore joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions in the future. In particular, we believe that a joint GST registration system with Australia would likely result in additional Government revenue from businesses that would not otherwise be required to register. The first steps will be to investigate technology that will allow this. Officials should continue to investigate ways in which this could occur including the technology used in other jurisdictions. Penalties for false representations by consumers We believe it is appropriate to extend existing penalties and interest rules to offshore suppliers. The Discussion Document proposes to require a person to register and pay the GST that should have been returned where as a consumer they have made false representations that they are in business to evade the GST impost. The Discussion Document gives very little detail on this proposal except to say that it would apply in exceptional cases. The spirit of the rule sounds sensible. However, the detail will be important. Without further information we are unable to provide additional comment.

Our key messages Trade Me supports: A fair regime for the collection of GST on low value imported goods. Further consideration of an extended status quo model of collection. In the event a supplier registration model is adopted, New Zealand taking a slightly different approach to Australia by adjusting some key settings to ensure a more workable regime. In particular, we support: oThe electronic marketplace (“EMP”) definition not applying to onshore marketplaces. oSpecial provisions for ‘approved marketplaces’ that are offshore. oThe Commissioner having a discretion to allow partial compliance of offshore suppliers and marketplaces. oA more simplified regime, with fewer exceptions, to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers and marketplaces and address double taxation risks. We believe these changes will help to reduce offshore supplier and EMP compliance costs. This is important as otherwise there is a material risk that suppliers and EMPs will cease supplying services to New Zealand residents, and consumers will be adversely affected. We have set out separately below our submissions in respect of the key issues discussed in the Government Discussion Paper and Additional Memo. When developing our submission, we have adopted the following principles. Over the past 19 years of operating online, we’ve found that laws work best when they are: straightforward and easy for consumers to understand and apply; RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 only apply to marketplaces operated by non-resident persons. However, as noted above, we recommend that a new provision be included that requires any such onshore marketplaces to provide information about each offshore supplier’s aggregated supplies to New Zealand to the IRD. This would better enable the IRD to enforce the GST requirements against suppliers who supply over $60,000 per year. Main policy justifications for treating the EMP operator as the supplier for low value goods for GST purposes: Minimisation of compliance costs Higher rates of compliance There is a spectrum of EMPs, some more akin to classified advertisements, to those that sell their own goods and have a great amount of control over third-party sales. There will be a point along this spectrum where the costs of compliance to the EMP operator are disproportionate to the revenue collected or to the compliance cost savings to underlying vendors trading through its platform. The EMP is deemed to be the supplier unless all of the following conditions are met: the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed that the supplier is liable for the payment of the GST; and the marketplace does not authorise either the charge or the delivery to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. We agree that there is a spectrum of online marketplace types, with differing levels of involvement in the sale of goods and services. Most marketplaces set some terms and conditions for the transaction in order to create a safe and trusted marketplace. As a result, we believe, the scope of the regime is potentially broader than perceived. If the definition is not carefully set, New Zealand risks creating a new set of distortions in the market. For example, consider the structure of a traditional taxi co-operative in New Zealand against the structure of the Uber ride-sharing service. Uber has structured their operations in such a manner that each driver who operates via the platform separately contracts with the customer. As a result, the applicable GST threshold is considered for each driver, and not for Uber at an organisational level. The outcome of this is that there is a significant portion of ride-sharing activity (and associated transactions) on which GST is not being collected. We believe that if any definition of “marketplace” is not sufficiently thoughtful and well-constructed, this could result in a shift in the manner in which online shopping and services are structured. For example, if social media platforms are not captured by the definition but bespoke marketplaces are, this would provide a social media platform with a 15% competitive advantage on price, which would distort activity across different business models. In addition, we are concerned that by creating a GST collection environment which gives a 15% benefit to less structured platforms, this may reduce the level of protection afforded to New Zealand consumers. For example, if we considered the EMP definition in respect of a marketplace with operations similar to Trade Me: ensure that the documentation identifies the supplier as making the supply: Trade Me already does this, and requires the supplier to comply with product safety, intellectual property and other legal obligations. ensure that the supplier is liable for the payment of GST: Trade Me already requires that all auctions must include GST and all tax obligations are the responsibility of the seller and/or the buyer (as the parties determine). The “or the buyer” phrase is particularly applicable for high value imported goods. change its terms such that the marketplace does not authorise the change or the deliver to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made: Trade Me already does not authorise the charge or the delivery. We often do not even see the charge. For example, Australian based sellers listing on our site can register an NZ bank account and we allow them to receive payment into that bank account, with them arranging and RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 authorising delivery once they’ve confirmed payment is received. As a result, the only thing that a marketplace structured in a similar manner to Trade Me would need to do to avoid being the deemed supplier would be to change its terms and conditions such that the marketplace doesn’t set any of the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. We think this creates adverse consequences. Currently, almost all marketplaces set some general terms and conditions that apply to sellers using their marketplaces, and the supplier sets the specific terms relating to a trade (e.g. shipping timeframe, returns policies etc). As a result there is a hybrid arrangement. However, the terms that Trade Me sets are focused on ensuring trust and safety, and ensuring appropriate consumer protections apply in our New Zealand environment – i.e. terms to ensure that members have trust in our site and products sold on our site are safe. We think it would not be desirable for marketplaces to be incentivised not to set such terms in order to avoid GST liability. We agree there is a spectrum of marketplaces. We have compared on the following page ASOS, Amazon, eBay, Trade Me and Facebook. If the policy settings favour using online marketplaces or suppliers to collect GST, we support either: all marketplace platforms, including social media being captured by the relevant definitions (i.e. all the examples above); or only those marketplace platforms that behave like a supplier (i.e. in the table below ASOS and Amazon being captured). From a practical perspective, we acknowledge that if a particularly broad definition is used then it will be harder for some social media platforms to comply with the requirements. This is why we support (see below) the Commissioner having a discretion to allow aspects of non-compliance where marketplaces have a compelling case not to comply with the requirements. Accordingly, we recommend a broader definition of EMP with and an ability for EMPs to be able to apply to the Commissioner to gain exemption from certain requirements.

CAPEC New Zealand has consistently held the view that any changes to the collection of taxes for low value goods should be underpinned by the following Guiding Principles: •Effective and efficient collection of revenue; •Competitive neutrality (between air cargo and post); •Consistent application of border clearance and taxation arrangements; •Recognition of CAPEC New Zealand’s unique and essential role as a provider of time definite delivery services. •Ongoing and meaningful consultation with Government Executive Summary CAPEC New Zealand has reviewed the GST on low-value imported goods – an offshore supplier registration system publication by the Inland Revenue, along with the Explanatory Material and Q&A, released in June 2018. It should be noted that New Zealand Customs and the New Zealand Government has engaged closely with CAPEC New Zealand Members as part of the consultation process for the last 3 years. This engagement has proven to be invaluable in terms of clarifying policy intent and reviewing the practicality of various processes and procedures. CAPEC New Zealand greatly appreciates being consulted on such important policy reform. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 CAPEC New Zealand believes that the only equitable, timely and cost effective m ethodology to collect GST from Low Value Goods is through collecting the GST for goods valued at under $400 directly at point of sale at origin. This methodology can be implemented without the need to delay the movement of goods through the Border and will assist in Facilitation of Trade. We understand the position taken by Government on the current inequities of GST collection between low value on shore and off shore purchases. We also believe that the consumer should be able to access the benefits of a truly global market place. With this in mind we firmly hold the position that the collection of tax must be done in a way that the cost of collection does not outweigh the amount collected and done with minimal disruption. Furthermore the consumer should not have to take on additional collection costs over and above that of the tax itself. Based on the above CAPEC New Zealand strongly supports the offshore collection of GST and endorses the model and approach that Australia has taken. CAPEC New Zealand would like representation and consultation in relation to any potential changes to the LVG threshold and any changes to the current collection at the border for tax & duty. Notwithstanding this stakeholder engagement, there remain several key areas of focus for CAPEC New Zealand Members have concerns with the offshore collection model. These can be summarized as follows:- • Double Taxation • Valuation • Issue of Combined Entries • Refund of Undue Payments • Reconciliation • Vendor Compliance/Enforcement • Currency (Exchange rate) Double Taxation CAPEC New Zealand believes that double taxation will be common if duties are calculated at invoice item/line level and strongly suggests taxation at a total invoice level per transaction. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 CAPEC New Zealand is concerned that consignments valued above $400 c ontaining multiple goods, some or all of which are valued at or below $400, will have a common occurrence of double taxation. When the goods valued above $400 enter New Zealand, they will undergo a formal customs clearance and will be subject to import transaction fee, duties and GST. CAPEC New Zealand supports the reasonable belief test for vendors to apply. This allows the vendor to not collect GST on a low-value imported good if they have a reasonable belief that the good will be sent in a consignment valued above the low-value threshold. Valuation CAPEC NEW ZEALAND believes the Customs value of the goods should be based on CIF by the vendor. This is because GST is currently collected by NZ Customs for goods over $400 based on CIF. If the vendor collected GST where the valuation of the goods is based on the Customs value, the occurrence of double taxation will be more likely(see below) Example of Double Taxation: Customs Value based on Cost of Goods (NZD) IPAD Cost 380 Total GST Charged by Vendor: 57 (If the vendor only charges GST on the value of goods and doesn’t include the freight component when it reaches New Zealand, the freight component will push it over threshold). When the Goods enter NZ they will undergo a customs entry and the below charges will apply: Total GST Charged by NZC 63.00 Import Transaction Fee 52.67 Total Charges 115.67 Therefore it is important that the mechanism to collect GST is based on CIF when collecting GST using the vendor collect model. This will therefore match the way GST is assessed at the border for goods over $400. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 Is sue of Combined Entries New Zealand Customs currently combine entries for multiple shipments for same importer but different suppliers. Ex ample: Consumer buys a shirt from Vendor A worth NZ$300 and shoes from Vendor B worth NZ$200. Because the value is worth less than $400 for both Vendor A and B, the offshore vendors charge GST at the point of sale. New Zealand Customs requires the shipments to undergo combined entry when they enter New Zealand. These goods will then be subject to duties, GST and entry charges. Therefore double taxation will occur. CAPEC New Zealand believes that all entries into New Zealand for goods under current threshold should be exempt from combined entries if they are from different suppliers. This will reduce the amount of potential double taxation. Refund of Undue Payments Wh en both New Zealand Customs and the Vendor have charged GST a process will be needed to relieve the double taxation by refunding the consumer for the extra revenue they have paid. There are three main ways in which this could occur:- • Customs could refund the GST they have collected without the need to cancel and or adjust the original entry. • The vendor could refund the GST they have collected. • The consumer could request a refund of GST through an IRD refund claim process similar to how businesses currently claim GST refunds. Car riers and New Zealand Customs do not have the resources to handle the additional work associated with entry adjustments and refunds where GST has been collected by the vendor and at the border. Preferred option would be the consumer would approach the vendor for a refund. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 Reconciliation What mechanisms will be in place for reconciliation of paid consignments? Vendor Compliance / Enforcement CAPEC New Zealand strongly suggests that any non compliance/enforcement will not be the responsibility of the Members. Currency (Exchange Rate) The Customs value, or the value for duty of imported goods, is used to calculate the Customs duty. When the invoiced amount is not in New Zealand dollars, it will be converted at the rate in force on the day your entry is presented to us. Exchange rates used by us are set for a two-week period, and are published 11 days in advance. These rates may differ slightly from the currency rates published by overseas trading banks. The Members strongly recommend review for consistency. Summary The vendor collect model is acknowledged by CAPEC New Zealand’s the best approach and commends Inland Revenue’s decision to avoid the receiver collect model. Our belief is that the Inland Revenue wants to gain maximum clarity on the effectiveness of the vendor collect model without adding increased cost and regulatory burden to the express industry. We believe that the model proposed, whilst avoiding tax collection at the border, creates a new set of challenges which need to be considered during the process design. We encourage Inland Revenue to review the proposed design for collecting GST offshore and ensure that is effective and efficient for the express industry, provides meaningful data to the regulators and improves the GST revenue for the Crown. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 CAPEC New Zealand looks forward to receiving a response from Inland Revenue fo r consideration prior to the Draft proceeding to Parliament. Further industry consultation is critical in ensuring this policy reform leads to a more efficient and effective process. In this regard, CAPEC New Zealand Members would again extend an invitation to Inland Revenue officials to visit our facilities to gain a better understanding of the international air express environment and we would like to be involved in any workshops/working groups when it comes to industry input and feedback for the design of the proposed offshore GST collection model. Yours sincerely Dianella Ngakuru, Country Manager – Federal Express (Chairman) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1 | Page Submission to the Inland Revenue Department on GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system discussion document 3 July 2018 PUB-037 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2 | Page Overview This document is a submission on the proposed imposition of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on Low Value Goods (LVGs) sold to and imported by New Zealand buyers (Proposed Measures) using electronic distribution platforms (EDPs) by an industry group comprising Alibaba Group’s AliExpress, eBay and Etsy, which are third party online marketplaces (3P). Applying the same tax burden to remote, often small, retailers is unfair and potentially at risk of being reciprocated by other Governments on NZ small businesses operating online. The current proposal will result in high rates of non-compliance and thus not achieve the desired revenue increases for the Government of New Zealand, will disadvantage customers on 3P platforms, and will not achieve the Government’s objective of levelling the playing field for New Zealand retailers. We also recommend the establishment of an IRD-led industry working group (including marketplaces, logistics providers, payments systems and retailers) on this matter and a review of any model twelve months after any legislation is passed. Equally NZ should take stock of Europe’s timeline on this matter and align with those global timelines. The extraterritorial imposition of GST is contrary to good tax policy and has the following technical complications: 1. Reduced revenue of $40-65 million per annum – and rising The Government’s own estimates assume that two-thirds of online purchases will be captured by the proposed model. The Australian Treasury, when proposing a similar model in 2017, assumed a compliance rate of just 25%. Based on a similar compliance rate in New Zealand, the actual revenue raised by this tax would be $40-65 million per annum less than is projected, with the shortfall rising by about 10% annually as the volume of online trade increases. The proposed model will result in significantly reduced revenue to be reinvested into essential services for New Zealanders compared to a model which captures a larger percentage of online transactions. 2. Very high rates of non-compliance We believe compliance will be low as consumers will simply turn to websites or marketplaces that are not compliant; or use eBay or AliExpress as a search engine then purchase the equivalent product directly from the seller or through alternative, non- compliant retailers who will be able to offer the products at 15% less than compliant players; and which have spotty track records regarding consumer protection and regulatory compliance. There will be no new border processes to ensure GST has been captured. We understand that neither IRD nor Customs will be given additional resources to enforce the new rules. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 | Page 3. We are not traditional retailers As a technical matter, the proposed model is extremely difficult for 3P marketplaces to implement and we are yet to analyse any issues related to measures taken to comply with the flawed Australian collection model. 3P marketplaces do not hold the goods, and do not control the movement of the goods. We are not the sellers or owners of the goods, we simply connect buyers and sellers. The focus should be on 1P retailers/suppliers in the truest sense of that word. Government could consider an exemption for 3P marketplaces and focus on suppliers in the truest sense of that word. In our view however a logistics services/freight handler model would be far more effective and capture all LVG parcels coming across the border, as we outlined during Australian consultations too. 4. Unprecedented compliance costs will increase costs for Kiwi consumers The proposed model will require extensive system changes and ongoing compliance costs that will at least be partly borne by consumers as the NZ GST is a consumption tax, and therefore a tax on consumers. What Government is proposing is that suppliers bear the brunt of collection. eBay, Etsy and AliExpress are global platforms. These system changes are technically difficult and will still result in a less-than-optimal rate of revenue collection. There is a high degree of risk that consumers and businesses will face complications with the implementation of the proposed model as it is novel, complex and remains untested. 5. New Zealand retailers remain disadvantaged To use Australian Treasury modelling as an example, New Zealand businesses will continue to be disadvantaged as up to 75% of low value goods imported into New Zealand will continue not to be taxed, and thus continue to have a tax-price advantage over goods sold locally in New Zealand. This rate could increase should overseas retailers or marketplaces decide not to offer products to New Zealand consumers. This has been the case in Australia where Amazon has decided to restrict cross-border sales. Changing the GST laws as they relate to overseas online purchases will not fix all the issues faced by traditional retailers: for example, but not limited to wages, cost of rent and general cost of doing business in NZ. 6. Unfair to SMBs and individual sellers Under current GST rules, vendors who sell less than $60,000 of goods into New Zealand are exempt from GST. Under the new proposal, overseas Small and Micro Businesses (SMBs) will no longer be exempt if they sell through a platform like eBay, Etsy or AliExpress. This puts small businesses at a severe, clear and discriminatory disadvantage if they use 3P marketplaces, compared to suppliers who sell directly through websites or other channels which may result in decreased visibility, transparency and compliance in respect of regulations set by New Zealand authorities. 7. Higher trade barriers The extraterritorial application of New Zealand’s GST laws will create additional costs for overseas businesses and limit the free trade of goods into New Zealand. This is not in the spirit of various free trade agreements across the globe. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 | Page The proliferation of efforts to expand the imposition of local sales-type taxes on remote small businesses in the name of fairness will make it harder for Internet-enabled small enterprises to export. Before the Internet very small enterprises and microentrepreneurs rarely, if ever exported. They were generally trapped in their local market, increasingly faced direct competition from large enterprises with greater access to global markets, and were subject to ups and downs of their economic neighbourhood. The Internet has dramatically expanded the opportunity to small businesses to trade. While it is still very difficult for small and micro enterprises to compete head-on with giant competitors, access to global commerce platforms with many millions of users has allowed small enterprises, including in New Zealand, to carve out successful niches and grow. A better future for small businesses, who will continue to face large competitors with their traditional access to global markets, is to maintain low tax barriers and promote access to greater Internet-enabled exports and imports. A fairer more efficient collection model The authors of this submission believe the proposed model should be abandoned and replaced with a fairer more effective model, for example one based on an extension of current systems such as via collection at the border. This is what already happens for goods worth more than $400. Under the current proposal, there would be one system for goods under $400, and another system for everything else. A border collection model would address many of the concerns raised above, and would significantly increase the revenue captured. 100% of imports pass through the border so 100% of GST would be collected. Alternatively, the current proposals require rewriting to ensure they are workable. In particular, 3P marketplaces that merely provide listing and processing services to users should be treated differently under the proposed amendments. 3P marketplaces do not set the price, hold or handle goods, or have full knowledge of the flow of physical goods – therefore a model intended for online retailers cannot be easily applied to our platforms. We would welcome the opportunity for further discussion of the points made in this submission. About Us The members of the Industry Group operate websites that provide the ability for sellers to list goods for sale to buyers. These services are referred to as “3P”. 3P service providers rely on the information provided from users, do not set the price of the goods, and do not handle the goods. It is important to distinguish “3P” services from “1P” services where the website operator acquires the goods wholesale and resells the goods in its own right. Further information on each member of the Industry Group is outlined below. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 | Page Alibaba Group’s mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere.

In case you did not have time to join the calls or to provide written input, there is still a time window until the end of this week (Fri day July 6 th ) to provide written input. We have attached the relevant consultation documents again in this e-mail for your convenience. The first consultation document deals with the scope of market place rules, double taxation issues and valuation methods for the proposed $400 threshold. The colleagues from New Zealand Inland Revenue are mainly seeking feedback on the below 3 points which they also mentioned in their memorandum: 1. How to define an electronic marketplace for the purpos es of an offshore supplier registration model, if we propose to deem electronic marketplaces the suppliers who must collect the tax. 2. How to minimise the potential for double or non-taxation where low-value goods are transported with higher value goods and how to deal with refunds. 3. What is the appropriate value to apply the tax: the custom’s value or the price paid by the consumer. In addition, we received another consultation docume nt this morning from the New Zealand colleagues (which you will also find attached) focusing on approaches to the marketplace rules. Any input to this document is also highly appreciated. We would like to kindly encourage you to share your written input directly with the following colleagues from New Zealand Inland Revenue: Chris Gillion In case you have any follow up questions to the consultation, please feel free to contact the above mentioned colleagues directly.

This is particularly the case for deemed suppliers whose existing systems and contracts may not readily deal with the requirements to comply with the GST. Submission On balance, we consider it is now appropriate to apply GST to cross-border sales. However, it is important that the GST is implemented in as efficient a way as possible. Government needs to recognise that the proposal will disrupt commercial arrangements and that it is necessary for the administration of the system to be as light touch as possible. At the border compliance, particularly, needs to have a mind-set change so that goods from compliant suppliers are efficiently cleared. Foreign Supplier Model The starting point in Wayfair is that the tax is a tax on the consumer of the goods. However, collection and enforcement problems mean that the collection is imposed on the supplier. That is also the position for the document’s proposal – in particular, that technology limitations mean that the supplier should charge and collect the GST. However, the proposal is not limited to a supplier model. Both electronic marketplaces (“EMPs”) and re-deliverers are also required to register. The first extends the GST to goods supplied that would not be taxable if acquired in New Zealand. Individual businesses are not able to use the threshold and consumer to consumer (“C2C”) supplies are within the net. The re-deliverer registration requirement is a consumer collection model (albeit a before the border model). This hybrid model suggests that the limitations may be overstated. Further, the model means that there is a difference between the (theoretical) incidence of the tax (on the consumer) and the legal liability (on the supplier/deemed supplier). The proposed model is a mix of compromise and opportunism to raise as much revenue as possible. Submission It is important that there is on-going attention paid to the regime to make changes to reduce the costs as quickly as changes to Customs and postal processes allow. Summary of submissions Our further detailed submissions are in the Appendix. We summarise below our submission points. — To reduce compliance costs for offshore businesses required to register and account for GST under the proposed rules, we recommend that: - New Zealand’s rules for GST on low-value imported goods should be aligned with Australia’s to the extent Australia’s rules are workable. Problems arising from those rules should be dealt with and not repeated in New Zealand’s rules. - Registrants should be given the option to charge GST on all their low-value imported goods sales, so that they do not have to verify which sales are made to GST registered businesses. - A searchable public register of GST registered businesses is made available to allow registrants to determine whether they are making supplies to GST registered businesses. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 3 — The rules should include provisions to ensure that consumer-to-consumer sales of low-value imported goods made through an electronic marketplace (“EMP”) are not subject to GST. — The threshold for the low-value goods should be determined with reference to the Customs value of the goods and the GST value of the goods should include delivery charges. — Consideration should be given as to whether the threshold can be increased from the proposed NZ$400 to NZ$1,000. — Customs and Inland Revenue need to have an efficient clearance and audit process to ensure double taxation does not arise. In particular, processes should be established so that it is reasonable to rely on audit rather than at the border clearance processes. — The time limit for making output tax adjustments for refunds given by offshore suppliers should not be limited to two years. — The rules should provide practically achievable criteria for EMPs to apply for an exemption from the rules so that the primary obligation to return the GST on the sale of low-value imported goods is on the actual supplier. The overriding of commercial arrangements and the cost of implementation should be dealt with by the proposal. — The rules should state the time of supply for vouchers issued by EMPs is at the time of redemption as opposed to issuance. — The rules should confirm that offshore suppliers only take into account direct sales when determining whether the offshore supplier has exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. Officials should also consider a simplified set of threshold rules being applied. — Non-resident suppliers required to charge GST under these (or the remote services) rules, should be entitled to recover input tax on acquisitions for their non-New Zealand activity and supplies. — The application of New Zealand consumer law to GST pricing of foreign suppliers should be considered and if necessary, it should be confirmed that GST exclusive quoting but GST pricing at the checkout is allowed.

Yours sincerely Peter Scott Partner John Cantin Partner RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 4 Appendix: Submission on GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system (A government discussion document) General design comments Extended offshore supplier registration model The discussion document notes that three options were considered for the collection of GST on low-value goods being: 1 At the point of sale where the offshore supplier will be required to register for GST and collect GST on their sales. 2 Between the point of sale and delivery where the courier companies and New Zealand Post would collect the GST on low-value goods sales. 3 After the delivery of the goods where the recipient of the goods would pay the GST after their delivery. The discussion document recommends an offshore supplier registration model (under the first option) at present as there are practical concerns for the latter two options that make them infeasible in the short to medium term. We note that the model outlined in the discussion document is not a pure offshore supplier registration model due to the extension of the GST registration requirement to include EMPs and re-deliverers. These are not the supplier of the goods. This presents some policy and practical challenges that need to be carefully considered in the design of the proposed rules. Further, particularly for EMPs, existing business models and contractual arrangements will not easily accommodate the proposals. We note below particular submissions that may allow more appropriate outcomes. Alignment with Australian rules GST applies to low-value goods imported into Australia from 1 July 2018. The proposed rules for charging GST on low-value goods imported into New Zealand are largely similar to the Australian model. Given Australia and New Zealand’s close relationship and geographic proximity, there will be many offshore suppliers, EMPs and re-deliverers that will be selling/shipping low-value goods to both countries. We would encourage officials that, to the extent possible, New Zealand’s rules should be aligned with Australia’s. This will help minimise the compliance cost for offshore businesses that need to comply with both countries’ low-value goods rules. However, equally, attention should also be paid to practical and technical problems with the Australian rules. Our feedback is that the rules are not always as easily implemented as the model would suggest. New Zealand has time available to work with suppliers to consider the rules and to find solutions. Consumer to consumer (C2C sales) From a policy perspective, so that New Zealand and foreign sourced goods have the same treatment, the proposed rules should not apply to sale of goods that would not be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. The proposals may overreach where the goods are being sold by a private seller, i.e. C2C sales through an electronic marketplace. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 5 The proposed rules should ensure that C2C sales are not subject to GST where they are sold through an electronic marketplace. Some suggestions on how this can be achieved are: — Exclude from the EMP rules, platforms that mainly only provide a service to list goods for sale. This will ensure that C2C sales would not be subject to GST. The offshore private seller would not have an obligation to charge GST under the proposed rules. On the other hand, offshore businesses that use the listing platform to sell their goods would still have the requirement to register for and charge GST on their low value goods sales. — If this exclusion is not workable, then we would recommend that EMPs are given the option not to charge GST on the sale of goods made through their platforms where they reasonably expect that the seller is not carrying on a taxable activity, e.g. EMPs would require their customers to confirm whether they are a business or private seller when on- boarding users onto their platform. Valuation We believe that two separate issues need to be considered: 1 what value of the goods should be used for determining whether the goods are below the threshold for GST to apply 2 whether, if a good is subject to the low-value goods regime, the costs of delivery and insurance to the end customer should be included in the taxable value of the goods. We consider the second issue first. Including international freight and insurance in the value of the goods We agree that delivery charges (i.e. international freight and insurance) for low-value goods should be included in the value of the goods for GST charging purposes. Simply, the value of the consumption in New Zealand includes the price of the goods plus the cost of getting the goods to New Zealand. Therefore, it is logical that those costs are included in the value of the goods. This is consistent with the current valuation rules in section 12 of the GST Act. This is also consistent with the stated policy objective of applying GST on low-value imported goods in order to level the playing field with local suppliers. For local suppliers, their cost of making the goods available to their customers includes the cost of delivery of the goods into their shops, and these delivery costs are then recovered in the price for which they sell their goods. Accordingly, not including delivery charges for low-value imported goods would not put the local suppliers in a level playing field. Value for determining whether goods are low-value goods Officials are considering two valuation options in determining whether goods are low-value goods, being: 1 the Customs value of the goods 2 the GST value of goods (i.e. the customs value plus delivery charges – see above). Our preference would be for the threshold to be based on the Customs value of the goods because: — From the offshore supplier/EMP re-deliverer’s perspective, it would be easier for them to set-up their systems to add GST where the value/price of the goods is below the low-value goods threshold. This is because, typically, delivery charges are not known until the customer proceeds to ‘check-out’ the goods, so whether GST applies or not would be RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 6 determined only at the end. Including the delivery charges can then be accommodated by adding GST to the delivery charge at the end of the process. — From a customer experience perspective, it would also be preferable that the prices quoted by the offshore supplier (for example in the supplier’s website) includes all applicable taxes, e.g. customers may not be happy to see a price of NZ$370 for example, and then find out when they proceed to the check out that they need to pay an additional 15% on top of the price quoted as the delivery charges exceeded NZ$30. — Australia’s low-value goods threshold is based on the Customs value of the goods. Aligning the New Zealand threshold valuation method with that of Australia’s will help minimise the compliance cost for offshore businesses that need to comply with the rules in both countries. Threshold value The discussion document proposes a NZ$400 threshold in order for GST to apply on low-value imported goods. We recommend officials consider whether this threshold can be increased. If this is an option, then we would recommend a threshold value of NZ$1,000. The practical benefits of increasing the low-value goods threshold are: — Given that Australia’s low-value goods threshold is set at AU$1,000, increasing the New Zealand threshold to NZ$1,000 will further align the rules between the two countries. — A higher threshold will reduce cases where a single consignment has multiple low value goods that exceed the threshold and the practical issues associated with that issue. We note that the Customs de minimus value will need to be aligned with the threshold to ensure there is no double-taxation of the imported goods. Supplies of multiple low value goods Double taxation As noted in the discussion document, there is a potential for double taxation where a single consignment includes multiple goods that individually are below the low-value goods threshold, but in aggregate, exceed the threshold. In this case, the offshore supplier (assuming they are required to register for GST) would have charged GST on the individual items sold under the proposed rules; however, as the consignment value is above the customs de minimus value, NZ Customs will also seek to collect GST at the border, when these goods are imported. In order to prevent double taxation, it is proposed that the consumer would need to provide Customs with appropriate evidence of the GST payment so that GST will not be collected again at the border. While we agree that this is an option, we would urge officials to consider more efficient procedures for providing evidence to Customs that GST has already been paid at the point of sale. Requiring customers to produce the evidence that GST has been paid on the imported goods creates a delay in the movement of goods at the border (as the goods will not be cleared until the customer has provided the evidence required). This raises the concern that implementing the GST on low value goods will unduly interfere with trade. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 7 Further, this adds administrative costs to Customs in contacting the customer and processing the evidence provided. A trade-off for GST being applied on low value goods is that duty and cost recovery charges will not apply. We assume that will be the case for consignments of low value goods otherwise consumers will pay GST and customs cost recovery charges and duty. The costs would not therefore be recovered by Customs. We recommend officials consider Customs: — Develop an Approved Supplier regime for registered suppliers/EMPs/re-deliverers. Consumers of goods supplied by Approved Suppliers would not be required to separately prove GST payment. Instead, Approved Suppliers would be subject to post-importation audit activity by Customs and Inland Revenue, and/or — Provide documentation guidelines that would allow a supplier to show that GST has been charged. We would expect over time suppliers would comply with these requirements if it made the customer experience easier. If measures such as these are implemented, enforcement of the proposed rules should be easier. Complying suppliers will be more visible so that audit checks are simpler. Potentially non-complying suppliers will also be more visible. We have made two assumptions: 1 Information will be exchanged between Customs and Inland Revenue under the Customs and Excise Act 2018. 2 The proposals’ references to the consumer proving GST has been paid is intended to be a reference to GST has been charged. A consumer is unlikely to ever be in a position to prove that GST has been paid by the supplier. Reasonable belief Australia has a reasonable belief test for whether goods will be part of a consignment or not and therefore whether the threshold is breached or not. If New Zealand has an equivalent rule, the reasonable belief exclusion should be optional. This would allow: — GST to be applied automatically to goods that are below the threshold. This is likely to be attractive if Customs processes for confirming that GST has been charged are efficient and not intrusive. — Suppliers, who are uncertain whether goods are part of a single consignment or not, to charge GST without any concern that it may have been incorrectly charged. Option to charge GST on B2B sales It is proposed that only sales of low-value imported goods to non-GST registered recipients (B2C sales) will be subject to GST under the proposed rules. However, there will be an option to zero-rate sales to GST registered recipients (B2B sales). The proposed rules will require the offshore supplier, EMP or re-deliverer to differentiate between B2C sales that are subject to the proposed rules and B2B sales that are not. This creates a compliance burden as procedures/systems to verify whether the recipient of the goods is GST registered will be required. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 8 In order to ease the compliance burden for registrants, we recommend they are also given the option to charge GST on all their low-value imported goods sales, i.e. not to differentiate between B2C and B2B sales. We emphasise that this should be an option and not the default rule as not all registrants may want to charge GST on all their sales. Registrants that already have their systems set-up to differentiate between B2B and B2C sales will want to have the option to continue to treat B2B sales as not subject to GST or zero-rated. Public register of GST registered businesses As noted above, the requirement to differentiate between B2B and B2C sales under the proposed rules is a compliance burden for the registrant. In order to ease this burden, we would also recommend that a searchable public register of GST registered businesses is made available. This would provide registrants with an easy and cost- effective method for checking whether the recipient is GST registered. This would have the additional benefit for a range of other situations under current GST legislation where confirmation of the GST status of a supplier or recipient is needed to determine the correct GST treatment (for example, zero-rating of land transactions; insurance claims paid by insurers; claiming of second-hand goods credits). Refunds/returns Where an offshore supplier provides a refund to the customer for goods returned by the customer, it is proposed that the supplier will be able to adjust its output tax for the GST refunded. However, it is noted in the discussion document that the time limit for making the output tax adjustment would be two years, as required under section 20 of the GST Act 1985. We do not agree that the two year time limit applies to a domestic supply. The two year time limit only applies to unclaimed GST input tax. It does not apply to output tax adjustments (for example, via credit note). A two year limit should not apply to offshore suppliers. If there is an option to charge GST on B2B sales, we would expect the recipient’s input tax claim would automatically be adjusted via the credit note rules. We recommend that is confirmed. Requirement for EMP to register and return GST on low-value imported goods Under the proposed rules, EMPs will be required to register for and return GST on low-value imported goods sold through their platform where customers would normally consider the EMP to be the supplier and this is reflected in the contractual arrangements between the parties. Policy and practical considerations We note that this proposal is contrary to the scheme of the rules that apply to domestic suppliers. This is a significant departure from the policy of the domestic rules. Even an agent for a supplier is not the supplier for GST purposes unless specific rules are followed and the parties agree. The proposal is justified on revenue and compliance grounds. The proposal will capture more supplies with fewer registered persons. Officials should be aware that the: — Proposal comes at a cost to EMPs. Implementing the rules when the EMP is not the actual supplier is not necessarily straight-forward or cheap. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 9 — Goods are likely to be less tied to a platform than remote services. Suppliers have direct distribution channel options that may not be the case for remote services. The differences in thresholds may therefore encourage suppliers to direct rather than EMP channels. This would mean that the same economic transaction has different GST results. — Proposal is likely to require that commercial arrangements will need to be renegotiated. We have not analysed the position in any detail but we would not expect section 78 to facilitate amendments to existing contracts between suppliers and EMPs. (These contracts are unlikely to have New Zealand as the governing law. We have not researched whether section 78 can have extra-territorial reach. However, even if it can, commercial renegotiations would still likely be required.) — Proposal may mean that consumer to consumer transactions are included when they would not be if the supply was a domestic supply. — Resident EMPs, which may have resident and non-resident suppliers, have a particular problem as domestic suppliers are deemed to sell through the EMP as well. We recommend that, if the EMP proposal proceeds, these particular issues are dealt with. Ability for supplier to be responsible It is proposed that the remote services rules of when an EMP will be required to register will be applied for low-value imported goods, i.e. an EMP will be required to charge GST unless all the following criteria are met the: 1 documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the EMP 2 underlying supplier and the EMP have agreed that the supplier is liable for the payment of the GST 3 EMP does not authorise either the charge or the delivery to the recipient, nor set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. In respect of the second criteria above, we understand that if a supplier is not required to register, as it does not meet the NZ$60,000 registration threshold, the criteria can still be satisfied. In other words, if the supplier agrees to meet their GST obligations, that is satisfied if they are below the threshold and not required to register for GST and charge GST. We also note that based on our discussions with various EMPs, it is highly unlikely that the EMPs will be able to satisfy especially the third criteria in practice. This is a concern as in some cases it would not be reasonable for the EMP to have the primary responsibility for returning the GST, e.g. if the payment is received directly by the supplier. The EMP proposal is also contrary to a supplier model of responsibility for charging and collecting GST. To mitigate those concerns, it is also proposed that EMPs will be allowed to not be treated as the supplier, at the Commissioner’s discretion, where the EMP has a ‘compelling case’ that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with its obligations. While we support consideration of this option, we would encourage officials to: — set the criteria for what a ‘compelling case’ would be at a practically achievable level; and — consider whether this option can be more widely applied, given the EMP rules do not sit easily with domestic policy. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 10 Vouchers issued by EMPs Some EMPs issue gift cards/vouchers that can be used to purchase goods in the EMP’s platform. The vouchers may be used to: — Purchase goods that are not consumed in New Zealand, for example, if goods are purchased using a voucher but are not shipped to New Zealand. No GST should apply. — Purchase goods that are above the threshold so that there will be double taxation if GST is charged on issue. Further the vouchers may be in denominations that are more or less than the threshold but may be used for low value goods or not. We recommend that a specific time of supply rule is included in the rules for vouchers issued by offshore EMPs, so that the time of supply for these vouchers is only on redemption of the vouchers. This will ensure that GST will only apply where these vouchers are used to purchase low-value imported goods into New Zealand. Registration threshold The proposed rules require an offshore supplier to register for and charge GST on low-value imported goods where its supplies exceed NZ$60,000. However, it is not clear from the discussion document, whether the NZ$60,000 threshold for an offshore supplier will only include its direct sales to New Zealand customers, or whether they include both direct sales and sales made through an EMP. We understand that the threshold is to be applied only to direct sales. This should be clear in the proposed rules. The registration threshold rules have look back and look forward rules. With exchange rate as well as demand volatility, it is likely that foreign suppliers will move above and below the threshold. Theoretically, and consistent with domestic suppliers, this would make them liable to register and provide them with an option to deregister. Consideration should be given to whether the threshold tests can be amended for offshore suppliers so that they can practically be applied. As an example, the test could be applied annually based on the supplier’s financial balance date rather than on a rolling 12 month basis. Section 54B Non-resident supplier registration Non-residents are able to register and recover input tax for supplies acquired for a taxable activity that does not involve New Zealand taxable supplies. This rule is consistent with the policy that GST is a tax on personal consumption and is not a tax on business. The rules currently prevent a non-resident from using these rules if they make any New Zealand taxable supplies. In our view, they should still be able to claim input tax for acquisitions which relate to supplies outside the scope of New Zealand’s GST. A consequential change to section 54B is required to allow this to occur. GST inclusive pricing New Zealand consumers are used to transacting on a GST inclusive basis. If that is not the case, suppliers are careful, as a result of New Zealand consumer law, to make it clear that the quoted price does not include GST (i.e. GST will be added to determine the total consideration.) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Inland Revenue KPMG Submission: GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system 5 July 2018 ACTIVE\_13800633\_1.DOCX 11 Offshore suppliers are unlikely to be transacting on the same basis. This is particularly the case where the supplier sells to multiple jurisdictions with different tax rules. As the application of a particular rule is not known with certainty until the goods are ordered, tax is often added at the check-out. We would expect foreign suppliers to want to continue with their current processes. Whether and how New Zealand consumer law applies to imported low-value goods needs to be considered. The current and desired position should be confirmed and consulted on by Officials. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT High Level Summary of Key Points on the GST on low value goods proposals in New Zealand Ge n eral •A simple and flexible tax regime is key from a business and tax authority perspective in order to ensure that trade remains as unaffected as possible by VAT/GST considerations, thereby maximising tax revenues – a win-win for all parties. Striking the right balance in terms of compliance requirements should also help minimise the cost of collection for business and the cost of administration/enforcement for tax authority. This is particularly important for the new marketplace rules on low value goods where a variety of fast evolving business models exist, which makes it difficult to come up with a “one size fits all” approach, therefore flexibility is key. With this in mind giving business a range of options at hand, which they can chose from based on clear rules and sound administrative practices will create certainty and will allow them to act as tax collector in the best possible way ensuring neutrality of the tax and market (channel) neutrality through creating a level playing field, while at the same time safeguarding VAT revenues for governments. Given the significant complexity around scope, double taxation and valuation, therefore any solution needs to be efficient, simple and flexible. •On the basis that the measures impact foreign businesses, determining an effective communication strategy is critical to success – how will non-resident businesses know that the rules exist? Australia ́s approach with roadshows, etc. might also be helpful to consider. Happy to support on this, as I have done with the Australian colleagues. •Sufficient lead time should be set aside in order that business and tax authority are able to make adequate preparations for implementing the rules. This is also important for the communication strategy. From a business perspective, 6 – 12 months is generally considered a minimum length of time for making ready, although longer may be required if significant IT systems development is necessary. •The rules introduced for digital services in New Zealand a couple of years ago (which BIAC also facilitated input to) try to keep things simple and flexible for business regarding the way how best and easiest to comply and should therefore also be as much as possible followed for low value goods. Business sees the New Zealand rules on digital services as best practice in the international context and encourages New Zealand Inland Revenues to build the new rules for low value goods on this fundament. Looking at the consultation documents, business clearly recognizes, that New Zealand Inland Revenues ́ aim is to make things as business friendly as possible, which the business community is highly appreciating and is very thankful for. Specific aspects As mentioned in our calls, businesses from the marketplace sector are best placed to share business specific aspects on the points addressed in the consultation documents, as they know the commercial environment best. However, I am very happy to share my personal thoughts based on my experience and what I have learned from my discussions with them. PUB-040 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT • Scope of the proposed EMP rules: o It might make sense to deem the marketplaces the supplier in all circumstances in order to avoid undue complexity. However, this raises potential equity issues for small businesses trading below the registration threshold but selling goods through a platform versus small businesses acting independently and not charging VAT. Personally, I'm not sure there's much option here but to allow a slightly unlevel playing field since the value of supplies should be low versus potentially high complexity. o As mentioned in the consultation documents, a broad approach might potentially result in some EMP operators being liable for GST in situations where it may not be reasonable to deem them to be the supplier for GST purposes. Therefore, giving them the possibility to approach Inland Revenues in a kind of ruling request to achieve certainty whether they are in scope or not of the new tax collector regime is very helpful and highly appreciated. o Both options highlighted in the consultation document  Option 1: Extend the marketplace rules for remote services to low- value goods but include a Commissioner’s discretion  Option 2: Marketplace liable unless they are a “recognised marketplace” have pro ́s and con ́s as highlighted in the consultation document. From my perspective, these options are not mutually exclusive. Therefore offering both as a starting point when the new rules are introduced and then try out which one works best in practice and then discard the other one later, might also be an approach to consider. o Regarding the aspect whether to deem the EMP operator to be the supplier regardless of residency or location of the vendor, or only if the vendor is based outside New Zealand, my personal view is that the option should be picked which most likely creates a level playing field and ensures both (monetary) neutrality (no VAT costs) and market channel neutrality for business. For this to happen the domestic supply “underlying supplier to marketplace” (B2B supply) needs to be treated as outside the scope of VAT to avoid cash flow and neutrality issues for the marketplaces. The possible addition to carve out EMPs through which predominantly domestic supplies are made is an excellent idea, which could also be followed. Also here, keeping things flexible as a starting point and gain practical experience before discarding things, might be an approach to consider. • Double taxation o The multiple consignment issues, FX variances and reasonable belief tests look complex, but business appreciates that NZ IR are being reasonably flexible in their approach. Conceptually, I would rather have fewer and more certain rules, but from a practical perspective, I think it makes sense to start with flexibility here and then adjust in light of experience. o Even with the best intention and process there will always be instances of double taxation it is therefore very important that an efficient refund process is put in place. There are two main ways mentioned in the document how RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT things could be set up - customs could refund the GST they have collected, or the vendor could refund the GST they have collected. Also here I think both ways are not mutually exclusive it might depend on the specific circumstances to decide which way is best to go. Therefore offering both ways as a starting point and then finding out in practice, which one works best and then discard the other one might also be an approach to consider. We are living today in a technology driven world of “try and improve”, therefore, adapting such an approach giving flexibility as a starting point and then see what works best in practice might be an avenue to explore and to reach the best way forward in practice after having tried things out first. • Valuation methodology: o It seems overly complex to set up a system to calculate GST based on the total value, but only charge this if the Customs value is equal to or less than $400. • Australian Experience o The experience in Australia will be critical. At this moment, given the rules are only effective since July 1, 2018, there is not much experience out there yet from the business side how things function in practice. As mentioned on the phone, very happy to collect the BIAC members ́ experience regarding Australia in the next couple of months and to set also up a conference call with all of you, if you find it helpful.

Historically, many governments and tax authorities have adopted Goods and Services Tax (GST) policies whereby the importation of goods below a defined de-minimis threshold would not be subject to GST and/or associated customs duties or charges. As the NZ Government’s discussion document notes, these policies have stemmed from a recognition that the compliance and administrative costs associated with low value imported goods (LVIGs) would outweigh the value of any GST collected. Amazon recognises the NZ Government’s concerns about its tax base and the position of NZ domestic retailers as being the primary drivers of the proposal to require offshore suppliers to collect GST on LVIGs supplied to NZ consumers. In addressing these concerns, Amazon urges the NZ Government to consider the elements of a GST collection model that will best meet its objectives of creating a genuinely level playing field between domestic and overseas retailers and maximising the collection of GST revenue. In particular, we urge the government to consider an approach that will ensure compliance by all suppliers regardless of differing business models. We are concerned that an unenforceable and unworkable collection model will harm both consumers and competition by potentially reducing access to competitively priced goods from overseas marketplaces. We recognise that the NZ Government has proposed an offshore supplier registration model that would require marketplaces to be treated as the supplier for the purpose of registering for GST and calculating, collecting and remitting GST on underlying supplier transactions. We also note the advice of the NZ Government’s Tax Working Group that “\[o\]ptions for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery...should continue to be reviewed to see if practical issues with them can be overcome and become an effective means of collecting GST on low value goods.” 1 Amazon is concerned that the proposed supplier model will not achieve the NZ Government’s objectives to create a level playing field between NZ and overseas retailers and maximise GST revenue collection. Moreover, this approach will likely require dedicated resources to address its shortfalls, similar in scale to those required to implement the modernised transporter model, while collecting only a fraction of the comparable revenue. While we welcome the opportunity to suggest improvements to the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model, Amazon would ultimately need to assess the feasibility and impact of any model adopted once the implementation details were established. This assessment may result in changes to 1 Letter to NZ Government from Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group, ‘GST on low-value imported goods’, 26 February 2018 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 3 the products and services Amazon is able to provide to NZ consumers, including goods or services offered by third parties on Amazon’s websites. The following submission addresses the challenges of implementing an effective model for the collection of GST on LVIGs. We have structured our submission into three distinct sections: 1. The broad issues with compliance and enforcement against entities and the necessity of border enforcement mechanisms in achieving the objectives of the proposed changes. 2. Our response to the advice of the Tax Working Group by outlining the scope and benefits of an alternative model, the modernised transporter model, for remittance of GST on LVIGs. 3. Our response to the NZ Government’s proposed model for an offshore supplier registration system, with suggestions for how this approach could be improved. Amazon emphasises that even with these improvements, the model will likely not meet the NZ Government’s objectives, nor match the modernised transporter model's rates of compliance or revenue collection. As an overarching recommendation, we strongly support the proposed removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from all imported goods valued at or below $400 regardless of the GST collection model ultimately adopted. This approach will reduce complexity and compliance costs and deliver direct benefits to NZ consumers. Finally, we urge the NZ Government to ensure the introduction of any new rules provides a lead time of 18-24 months to allow for businesses to implement changes to systems and processes and also to allow for appropriate communication plans to be deployed. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 4 1. Compliance and enforcement on low-value imported goods Effective compliance in cross-border tax collection requires enforcement at the border. Any collection model without border enforcement will depend on voluntary compliance and offshore enforcement, as was recognised in the final report of the Australian Government’s 2017 Productivity Commission review. 2 Australia will be the first country globally to adopt a supplier registration model. According to the Australian Government’s own modelling, at maturity – five years after implementation - this model will only collect GST on approximately half of all low-value goods imported into Australia. Amazon is concerned that even these estimates are optimistic, as ecommerce business models will continue to evolve, and consumers will increasingly purchase from untaxed suppliers driven by financial incentives. This low collection rate reflects the fundamental flaw of Australia’s legislated supplier registration model, in that it lacks any mechanism to enforce compliance at the border. Without border enforcement, governments will not achieve their objectives of creating a level playing field between domestic and overseas retailers and maximising the collection of GST revenue. Amazon supports these objectives and has urged the Australian Government to adopt an approach that would better achieve them. In its current form, the NZ Government’s proposed offshore supplier registration model (the ‘supplier model’) is similarly dependent on voluntary compliance from many thousands of offshore suppliers (including small businesses) and marketplaces that have no presence in NZ. This will require offshore enforcement of NZ laws against each of these businesses in every country in which they operate. Local laws cannot be effectively enforced with respect to goods sold by nonresident entities, in part due to the limitations of multilateral and mutual assistance treaties. This has the real potential to disadvantage local businesses, as voluntary compliance with the law cannot be assumed. As a result, Amazon is concerned that many businesses will not comply with the supplier model and will face no consequences for non- compliance given the lack of an effective enforcement mechanism. Another key limitation of the supplier model is that purchases made through online intermediaries and referrers are untaxed. Suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Consumers will adapt their buying behaviours to seek out the marketplaces and suppliers who do not charge the GST, further reducing GST collection. Moreover, as technology advances, the cost of establishing a marketplace will continue to plummet and new marketplaces will proliferate, potentially increasing such behaviour. A fair and effective cross-border tax collection model should be technologically neutral, keeping pace with these shifts in buying behavior and the ever-changing supply chain models that continue to emerge. Border enforcement would address this limitation and therefore create a more level playing field. 2 Australian Government Productivity Commission, Collection Models for GST on Low-Value Imported Goods, Productivity Commission Inquiry Report, No. 86, 31 October 2017, pp. 44-47 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 5 We note the discussion document cites the NZ Government’s implementation of the GST on cross-border services and intangibles as evidence that an offshore supplier registration system is “effective and relatively easy to comply with.” 3 However, we suggest that there are fundamental differences between the requirement for non-residents including marketplaces to collect GST on electronically supplied services (ESS) and the proposal to apply a similar requirement for tangible goods. These include:  There is a mechanism to tax tangible goods at the time of physical importation, with the potential to achieve close to 100% compliance. This option does not exist for ESS;  Cross border transactions of goods require the determination of where the goods are shipped from and whether the goods fall within changes to LVIG rules, raising the issue of which party is best placed to accurately make these determinations. ESS do not require similar determinations;  A standard rate of GST is applied to all ESS transactions, whereas goods in most jurisdictions attract different GST rates depending on the underlying product type. This requires detailed analysis to determine the appropriate GST liability, raising the issue of which party is best placed to accurately make these determinations;  Once the GST registration threshold is breached, all ESS transactions are subject to GST. This is different to LVIG requirements, where there is an additional need to identify whether the value of a transaction is above or below prescribed LVIG values; and  Transactions involving goods can be canceled, requiring the return of items, and giving rise to additional complex requirements for the supplier to track and amend underlying GST charged on initial sales. The process is much simpler for ESS transactions, which can simply be reversed. Amazon urges the NZ Government to consider these important differences as it assesses whether the offshore supplier registration model for ESS can be easily replicated for tangible goods. Amazon believes there is a case for considering a different approach for LVIGs, particularly in the potential role of border enforcement. 1.1. Stricter customs/border controls A common feature of all transactions that involve goods shipped to customers from overseas is that the goods need to be imported and declared to customs or border authorities. If customs and border authorities’ GST compliance activities are carried out correctly and strictly enforced, this should ensure that the majority of offshore suppliers declare and remit the correct amount of customs duties and GST on the goods they import. Robust compliance measures should apply to shipments through both express carriers and postal operators, ensuring compliance regardless of transportation mode. Amazon recommends that the NZ Government would most efficiently achieve its objectives by focusing on increased resourcing, better technological and reporting systems, and identification of indicators of fraud or under-declared values for goods. 3 'GST on low-value imported goods – an offshore supplier registration system: a government discussion document', Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, May 2018, p. 10 RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 6 Amazon also recognises that at present, NZ customs and border authorities may lack the resourcing and capability to undertake compliance and enforcement activities in relation to LVIGs cost-effectively at scale. However, shifting collection responsibilities and costs to offshore marketplaces is not the most efficient alternative, and ultimately, effective enforcement at the border may require much of the same resources and capabilities that the NZ Government is seeking to avoid. In this context, it is appropriate to consider which entities in the supply chain are best placed to assist with GST collection and remittance on LVIGs, in a way that facilitates effective border enforcement. Amazon notes that there is already operational infrastructure and technical mechanisms in place for the collection and remittance of GST on high-value goods at the border. Express carriers and postal operators are involved in the actual delivery of all imported sales and are therefore ideally placed to assist in border enforcement of GST on LVIGs. They customarily contract with suppliers to fulfil the customs clearance procedures and pay the import duties and taxes on their behalf. They have the direct relationships required to collect essential shipping data elements (ultimately from the principal supplier) including description of the goods, consignee details, country of dispatch and country of destination, weight, pieces, value and currency (at shipment level). As the NZ Government may be aware, Amazon has proposed an alternate collection model, utilising the unique position that express carriers and postal operators occupy in the supply chain for imported goods. Amazon has described this approach as a ‘modernised transporter model’ because it leverages the technological change that is already underway in parcel processing globally, driven by a combination of commercial and national security concerns. Amazon has provided submissions detailing the modernised transporter model to the Australian Government’s Productivity Commission inquiry into models for collecting GST on low value imported goods. 45 As stated above, we recognise that the NZ Government has requested feedback on the design of an offshore supplier registration model. At the same time, we note the advice of the NZ Government’s Tax Working Group that “\[o\]ptions for collecting GST between the point of sale and delivery...should continue to be reviewed...” 6 This recommendation recognises that the involvement of express carriers and postal operators is critical in achieving the NZ Government’s objectives for collecting GST on LVIGs. If the NZ Government were to adopt the supplier model for GST collection on LVIGs, it would be only the second country globally to do so. The model is untested, with the Australian Government’s modelling suggesting that approximately 85% of LVIGs passing its border will remain untaxed in the first 12 months. 7 Amazon is also concerned that an unenforceable and unworkable collection model will harm 4 http://www.pc.gov.au/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0008/221489/sub035-collection-models.pdf 5 http://www.pc.gov.au/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0017/222182/subs004-collection-models.pdf 6 Letter to NZ Government from Hon Sir Michael Cullen, Chair of the Tax Working Group, ‘GST on low-value imported goods’, 26 February 2018 7 Australian Treasury estimates indicated collection rates starting at 15 per cent in 2017-18 and then 21 per cent in 2018-19. See Amazon, ‘Submission to the Productivity Commission: Collection models for GST on low-value imported goods’, 4 September 2017, p. 43. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 7 NZ consumers by potentially reducing access to competitively priced goods from overseas marketplaces. We would therefore urge the New Zealand government to delay adoption and implementation until it has had sufficient opportunity to determine whether offshore suppliers are able to make the complex changes needed to comply with Australian law, whether Australian authorities are able to enforce the law, and whether large numbers of non-Australian suppliers are voluntarily complying. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 8 2. The modernised transporter model Amazon proposes an alternative GST collection model that takes the core principles of border enforcement and combines them with the significant and ongoing technological developments in logistics and clearance processes over recent years. The modernised transporter model would place enforceable liabilities on a limited number of domestic express carriers and NZ Post (collectively ‘transporters’) who each have a physical presence in NZ, and in respect of whom Inland Revenue has jurisdiction. For these reasons, and because the model will over time drive consistent treatment of goods entering NZ irrespective of who sold them, this model will ensure nearly 100 percent GST collection rates and will truly level the playing field between NZ and overseas retailers. Importantly, the modernised transporter model is neutral across transportation modes, using the availability of Electronic Advance Data (EAD) from both cargo and postal operators. Where currently certain transporters may be challenged to provide EAD, other stakeholders may be incentivised to provide the data in return for expedited facilitation, such as pre-arrival clearance and immediate release. In this respect, the model takes advantage of technological advancements that have occurred through recent years and are continuing to gather pace, driven by a combination of commercial and national security concerns. Governments are seeking greater visibility and assurance in regards to goods crossing their borders, while postal operators are competing with express couriers in parcel delivery, meeting the increasing expectations of customers for fast and convenient delivery. Achieving these outcomes cost-effectively and at scale requires data-driven solutions across both the cargo and postal streams to ensure there are no loopholes for non-compliant and potentially unsafe goods. The modernised transporter model is an alternative, not a complement, to the supplier model, and the former cannot be layered on top of the latter. A single point of tax assessment with a single party (the transporter) accountable for the GST is the only model that will drive consistency and compliance. Layered models will lead to duplicate or no GST being collected and asking multiple parties to incur compliance costs will further drive up costs for consumers. Whether under the supplier model or the modernised transporter model, the event triggering the GST liability on goods sold overseas to NZ consumers is not the sale of the goods alone (a transaction that occurs outside of NZ and which should not be subject to NZ taxes) but rather the importation of those goods into NZ. The actual importer of the goods is generally the consumer, and the supplier of the LVIGs typically engages the transporter on behalf of the consumer to handle importation of the goods into NZ and delivery to the consumer. As the transporter is the party facilitating the importation of the LVIGs for the consumer, the transporter is the most appropriate party to collect and remit the GST payable on those goods, based on information from the supplier. This model would also provide consistency with the established process whereby courier companies collect GST on goods above the de minimis threshold. Amazon would welcome the opportunity to discuss implementation of the modernised transporter model with the NZ Government in more detail. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 9 3. Improvements to proposed offshore supplier registration system Amazon recognises that the NZ Government has proposed an offshore supplier registration model that would require marketplaces to be treated as the supplier for the purpose of registering for NZ GST and calculating, collecting and remitting GST on underlying supplier transactions. We are concerned that this approach will not achieve the NZ Government’s objectives to create a level playing field between NZ and overseas retailers and maximise GST revenue collection. Moreover, this approach will likely require dedicated resources to address its shortfalls, similar in scale to those required to implement the modernised transporter model, while collecting only a fraction of the comparable revenue. While we welcome the opportunity to suggest improvements to the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model, Amazon would ultimately need to assess the feasibility and impact of any model adopted once the implementation details were established. This assessment may result in changes to the products and services Amazon is able to provide to NZ consumers, including goods or services offered by third parties on Amazon’s websites. 3.1. Border enforcement The primary, practical limitation of the NZ Government’s proposed supplier model is that it lacks an effective border enforcement process and is instead dependent on voluntary compliance and ineffective offshore enforcement. Without border enforcement, Amazon is concerned that the NZ Government’s proposed model will increasingly leak GST revenue over time and distort competition. Suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Consumers will have an incentive to purchase through untaxed suppliers and marketplaces, while non-compliant entities will benefit at the expense of compliant entities, and goods will flow through the border with no GST collected and remitted. Moreover, as technology advances, the cost of establishing a marketplace will continue to plummet and new marketplaces will proliferate, increasing such behaviour. Amazon believes this outcome would be unworkable and urges the NZ Government to consider different methods of border enforcement to create a more level playing field between NZ and overseas-based retailers. 3.2. Red lane/green lane parcel processing Amazon recommends the NZ Government consider steps to modernise parcel processing for LVIGs with the aims of maximising compliance and GST revenue collection. The NZ Government may consider leveraging recent and ongoing technological advancements in parcel processing to put in place border enforcement that is low-cost and scalable over time, with minimal impacts on NZ consumers. While this approach would not achieve the same level of compliance as the modernised transporter model, any level of border enforcement would improve compliance and level the playing field among offshore sellers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 10 Under present arrangements, Electronic Advance Data (EAD) is required to be submitted to the NZ Customs Service for packages sent via express couriers and freight forwarders. Amazon proposes that suppliers should be required to provide the NZ Customs Service with certain minimum EAD to help assess on an expedited basis that GST has been collected and remitted. Customs should then ‘match’ carrier information with supplier information and, accordingly, determine which packages are GST compliant. Based on this compliance determination, packages should be directed through different channels at the border. If a package is not GST compliant because it cannot be ‘matched’ between a marketplace and courier, that package should automatically be sent to a red channel. GST compliant packages would be directed through a green channel. 3.3. Primary liability A principle underpinning any fair and effective cross-border tax collection model is that it should not shift tax debts onto parties that do not have – and may be unable to obtain – sufficient information to determine the tax payable. The marketplace operator or provider is not the legal seller of record (SOR) in the transaction and marketplaces will not always know where and how these suppliers conduct their business to determine the GST accurately. For example, third party sellers who list their goods on Amazon are in control of their product listings, terms of sale, and fulfilment of sold goods to consumers. While some sellers can elect to use Amazon’s logistics services, Amazon frequently will not touch the goods or services that are sold by third parties through Amazon’s online stores since many sellers will directly fulfil orders submitted by consumers. In such cases, Amazon only facilitates orders between shippers and importers and may lack necessary information for determining the tax payable. Amazon therefore recommends that marketplaces should not have primary liability for GST or associated penalties for any GST errors relating to third-party sales due to inaccurate information provided by the suppliers. Rather, in an offshore supplier registration model, tax liability should be either on the SOR or the importer, with the marketplace operator (or carrier) liability limited to remitting collected proceeds designated by the SOR or consumer. 3.4. Channel neutrality A key limitation of the offshore supplier model is that suppliers looking to circumvent the law will easily be able to migrate their sales to non‐compliant marketplaces or new marketplaces that operate below the NZD $60,000 threshold. Amazon considers that any GST law should be neutral and equitable in terms of its application across businesses. In particular, if the NZ Government seeks to place any obligations upon marketplaces, these should be the same regardless of the structure of marketplace operations and whether marketplace operators are physically located within a particular territory or not. The scope and meaning of ‘marketplace’ should be based on the broadest possible definition that captures all marketplace models and operations that facilitate underlying transactions between third- party sellers and customers. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 11 3.5. Marketplace neutrality by enforcing or removing GST exemptions Amazon is concerned that the registration threshold of NZD $60,000 of low-value goods into NZ would make it nearly impossible for the government to detect noncompliance with the new GST law for all but the largest offshore suppliers. For example, without this threshold, it would be possible to execute a test buy for an inexpensive product from a company that is suspected of noncompliance in order to check whether they are paying the GST. However, with such a sizeable exemption, it may be very difficult to prove that a foreign business is above the threshold or required to be registered for GST. A similar issue arises with goods improperly classified as gifts to avoid taxation. The NZ Government should consider measures to prevent circumvention. This could be achieved by eliminating the NZD $60,000 threshold. Similarly, the gift exemption should either be fully enforced or eliminated to prevent improper classification. 3.6. Additional enforcement measures Inland Revenue should consider additional measures applicable to other parties that would continue to be involved in the supply of goods to NZ consumers. This could include financial institutions involved in the payment chain playing a further role in identifying non-compliant suppliers and blocking payments for underlying transactions where GST has not been collected. While including financial intermediaries is a potential option, there may be significant limitations to its implementation given the complexities of cross-border payment systems and the number of financial institutions and services involved. Express carriers and postal operators, which have control over the goods and customs formalities, should be required to undertake due diligence on both the consignment of goods and suppliers so that they are able to provide sufficient details to the authorities to identify non-compliant providers. Inland Revenue, working with the NZ Customs Service, should dedicate time and resources to actively identifying non-compliant suppliers. This could be achieved by performing ‘test buys’ from relevant websites and following those purchases through to determine whether GST is being collected and remitted by those suppliers. This would then allow the NZ Customs Service to focus specifically on bad actors and subsequently route packages shipped by those suppliers through a red channel. 3.7. Administrative simplifications Ease of implementation is an important consideration, not only for offshore suppliers, but also for government, as it will make implementation of any GST collection model more achievable. In part, the following simplifications support measures already proposed in the NZ Government’s discussion document:  Amazon strongly supports the proposed removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from all imported goods valued at or below $400 regardless of the GST collection model RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 12 ultimately adopted. This approach will reduce complexity and compliance costs and deliver direct benefits to NZ consumers.  Amazon recommends that Inland Revenue and the NZ Customs Service provide clear and simplified guidance as early as practicable on how GST status should be reflected in manifest and entry declaration data to avoid duplicative taxation at the border.  Amazon recommends that the NZ Government harmonise the bases for assessing customs value and GST value to create a simplified assessment basis. Having different valuation bases for customs duties and GST adds confusion and complexity in administration for all suppliers, particularly small and medium sized enterprises.

Deloitte welcomes the opportunity to submit on the proposed design of an offshore supplier registration system to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand customers and appreciates the numerous discussions with officials that we have had as part of this submission process. We acknowledge that due to the changing nature of the way New Zealand consumers are purchasing goods, the Government has made the decision to amend the GST legislation to increase the number of suppliers who are subject to New Zealand GST. Following the consideration of three different options for collecting GST on low value imported goods, the Government has decided to seek public comment on a model that collects GST at the point of sale (“offshore supplier registration”). Summary of submissions Our submission points will cover the following issues: 1. We support the proposed change from a ‘de minimis’ threshold applied by the New Zealand Customs Service (“Customs”) to a consignment value. 2. We submit that offshore suppliers applying the $400 value threshold should test the threshold using the ‘customs’ value. 3. We encourage Officials to consider the rationale for changing the taxing point to the point of sale in light of the nature and range of legal relationships existing at the point of sale - GST liability generally should follow legal ownership unless there are very strong reasons to change this.

We support the implementation of an exception similar to the ‘reasonable belief’ exception in Australia, as described in paragraphs \[3.20\] and \[3.21\] of the discussion paper. 5. Reducing legislative complexity by not excluding supplies made to businesses could significantly reduce offshore suppliers’ compliance costs and should be considered. 6. We recommend a two-tiered approach where Inland Revenue allows ‘Approved Marketplaces’ to only provide information on suppliers and supplies made into New Zealand, with no liability to collect GST. This rebuttable presumption model would push the GST liability to the underlying legal supplier of the goods, unless that underlying supplier fails to comply with the New Zealand GST rules, in which case the responsibility for the GST on future sales would fall back on the marketplace following notification by Inland Revenue. 7. We support the proposed concession to allow Marketplaces’ to act ‘as agent’ for underlying suppliers upon mutual agreement. 8. A lower registration threshold (i.e. $30,000) for offshore suppliers may counter-balance any concerns that putting liability on the underlying supplier will result in a lower level of compliance. 9. While not a revenue issue, we note that the paper does not contain detailed guidance on how, in practice, Customs processing of goods will occur to minimise delays. 10. We recommend that Officials review the proposed application date with Marketplaces and offshore suppliers to confirm that it will provide sufficient time for the development of required business systems and operating procedures required by the proposed changes. 11. We recommend that Officials seek further information and data from Marketplaces to support the policy rationale with clear evidence-based thinking. We have set out our submissions in more detail below. Yours sincerely Allan Bullot Partner for Deloitte Limited (as trustee for the Deloitte Trading Trust) If you have any queries about this submission, or for more information, please contact Allan Bullot at s9(2)(a) RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 3 The scope of the proposed offshore supplier registration rules Definition of ‘low-value goods’ 1 1. We support the proposed change from a ‘de minimis’ threshold applied by the New Zealand Customs Service (“Customs”) to a consignment value. This will treat all parcels of the same value in the same way regardless of the contents of the parcel. 2 2. We submit that offshore suppliers applying the $400 value threshold should test the threshold using the ‘customs’ value instead of the ‘total amount paid by the consumer less GST’ - i.e. that the cost of freight should not factor into whether a good is considered ‘low value’. 2.1. This approach is the most simple and will therefore be the easiest to implement with offshore suppliers. It is also more consistent with the underlying principles of the proposed changes – i.e. to balance additional tax revenue against the compliance cost borne by taxpayers and government agencies. 2.2. We note that this approach is also consistent with the existing definitions used by Customs and therefore may make implementation more efficient. 2.3. To the extent that “value substitution” between the value of the low value good and the transportation charges is seen to occur, we submit that the anti- avoidance provisions could apply, but we would expect that such situations are unlikely to occur in practice with any great frequency. Taxing at point of sale 3. We understand the policy rationale behind changing the taxing point to the point of sale. 4. We encourage Officials to consider this policy rationale in light of the nature and range of legal relationships existing at the point of sale, recognising that there is a diversity of transaction-types that result in goods being imported and consumed in New Zealand. We consider that GST liability should generally follow legal ownership, but we acknowledge Officials may consider some situations exist where this cannot apply. 1 See paragraphs \[3.3\] and \[3.6\] in the discussion document. 2 Currently, when goods are imported, Customs collects GST. Customs applies a ‘de minimis’ threshold of $60 (GST and tariff duty) in order to balance collection costs with potential tax revenue collected. Due to the ‘de minimis’ threshold including tariff duty (which applies at different rates to different goods), parcels of equal value may have differing GST treatment depending on whether the goods are subject to tariff duty.

We understand the policy rationale behind Officials’ proposed treatment of supplies of multiple low-value goods. 6. We support a mechanism to enable Customs to verify GST paid or partially paid on a consignment of multiple low-value goods, or a mixed consignment, in order to prevent double taxation. 4 7. We also support the implementation of an exception similar to the ‘reasonable belief’ exception in Australia, as described in paragraphs \[3.20\] and \[3.21\] of the discussion paper. 7.1. A ‘reasonable belief’ exception will minimise instances of double taxation as all consignments / packages entering New Zealand worth greater than $400 will be taxed by Customs, unless the offshore supplier attaches a notice of the GST already collected at the point of sale. 7.2. This pragmatic approach will simplify the compliance burden on offshore suppliers as there will be a clear line in the sand – i.e. offshore suppliers are responsible for collecting GST on any transactions where the good, or the total package of goods consigned, is less than $400 based on ‘customs value’. 7.3. This approach will also simplify the test of whether offshore suppliers must register under the proposed rules. 8. We understand consideration is being given to increasing the low value amount from $400 to $1,000. We support this review and note that a review of the data is likely to indicate that increasing the low value amount to $1,000 is likely to remove many of the practical issues associated with multiple supplies and consignments for most sales to New Zealand consumers. Consumers versus GST-registered businesses 9. We understand the underlying policy rationale for making an exception for offshore supplies to GST-registered businesses in New Zealand. We have been advised by a number of non-resident suppliers that they would actually prefer to not have to make any distinction by excluding supplies made to businesses, as they consider that this could significantly reduce offshore suppliers’ compliance costs. 10. We note we do not consider the potential missing trader fraud risk is as significant an issue for low value goods when compared to the remote services situations. By the very nature of the goods in question being “low value” the fiscal risk is reduced compared to remote services that could be for any value. 3 See paragraphs \[3.2\] to \[3.19\] in the discussion document. 4 See paragraphs \[3.16\] to \[3.18\]. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 5 11. If offshore suppliers are allowed to charge GST on supplies to businesses, there would need to be a process of issuing GST Tax Invoices to allow for recovery by the New Zealand GST registered customers. Registration requirements and returns filing Non-resident digital marketplaces – approved marketplace options 12. Under the proposed changes non-resident digital marketplaces will be deemed to be the supplier of goods, and, if the registration criteria are met, be required to collect and return GST on the aggregated supplies made via the digital marketplace (by all suppliers). 13. We suggest strong consideration is given to a model of taxing non-resident suppliers (and deemed suppliers) of low value goods with a two stage process. This could involve a rebuttable presumption that the operator of a digital marketplace is required to collect GST on all their suppliers of low value goods to New Zealand. The presumption could be rebutted provided that the operator of the digital marketplace satisfied certain tests and obligations, primarily around the supply of information on the level of sales of low value goods to New Zealand by the underlying legal supplier of the goods. In that case the obligation (if any) to collect and remit the GST on low value goods sales would fall upon the underlying legal supplier. 14. To the extent that an approved digital marketplace is subsequently notified by Inland Revenue that one of their suppliers of low value goods to New Zealand is not correctly meeting their New Zealand GST obligations, we suggest that the following options would exist; 14.1. The digital marketplace could use commercial pressure to encourage the non- resident supplier to comply with the New Zealand GST rules within a set time frame, if this did not occur then, 14.2. The digital marketplace could either refuse to sell that non-resident supplier’s low value goods to New Zealand customers, or 14.3. have the rebuttable GST collection presumption reinstated on the digital marketplace in respect of that supplier; i.e. the digital marketplace would need to collect GST on the sales of that non-compliant non-resident supplier’s sales of low value goods through the digital marketplace to New Zealand customers for all future sales. 15. We submit that this rebuttable presumption approach, while increasing the overall complexity of the regime somewhat, would be a better approach in the long run to obtain a balance between collecting the appropriate amount of GST on low value goods in a difficult environment while preserving the principled basis of the New Zealand GST system. 16. We accept that Inland Revenue would potentially be required to create a greater number of GST registrations for non-resident suppliers under this rebuttable presumption approach. However our discussions with various parties have indicated that the number of underlying suppliers of goods may not be unmanageable. We understand that the “80/20” rule may apply here. The work Inland Revenue is doing RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 6 to check this issue with various marketplaces is to be commended and should continue. 17. This rebuttable presumption approach (allowing sales through Approved Marketplaces to initially look to the underlying legal supplier of the goods) will be technologically independent to method of selling the goods through the digital marketplace. When the GST taxing point is on the underlying legal supplier, then the method in which they make the sale of the low value goods via digital channels to the New Zealand customers is irrelevant. If the explosive growth of online sales of goods has taught us anything, it is that we cannot predict all the ways that goods will be sold to consumers. New and innovated distribution methods for low value goods are being developed all the time and there is a real risk that any legislative regime that is created in reference to a particular model of distribution runs the risk of becoming out of date very quickly. We do however always know that regardless of the distribution method being used, there will always be an entity that is the legal supplier of the low value good to the New Zealand customer, hence our preference on the underlying legal supplier of the goods. 18. Due to the selling technology indifference, the rebuttable presumption model will also not create any commercial pressures for digital marketplaces to adopt any particular method of operating such that they fall on one side or the other of any GST dividing line. We submit that it is desirable for tax legislation to have as little impact on the design of commercial operations as possible. 19. If the rebuttable presumption model was adopted, we consider it would be open to Inland Revenue to draft the definition of a “marketplace” in a broad manner. 20. We consider that the initial proposal for a “one size fits all” approach is problematic because digital marketplaces for goods display some unique characteristics, which require consideration in contrast to remote services. 20.1. Goods Marketplaces are less aggregated than similar platforms for offshore services. The disaggregation means that there are multiple business models being employed by goods Marketplaces which will be affected differently by the proposed changes – no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach will work for Marketplaces. 20.2. In our experience, digital marketplaces for services tend to be more direct with fewer distinct operating / business models applied. In contrast, there are a variety of business models currently employed by offshore suppliers selling goods for New Zealand consumption. For example, we are aware of Marketplaces that use the following models: 20.2.1. Direct selling / Out and out – i.e. selling as the principal, where legal ownership is with owner of the Marketplace; 20.2.2. Selling on behalf – where the Marketplace takes on some level of risk for the goods, advertises and facilitates payment; 20.2.3. Advertising and payment services; RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 7 20.2.4. Advertising-only services – i.e. no facilitation of payment, akin to the ‘classifieds’ section of a local newspaper; and 20.2.5. Offering a mixture of two or more of the above. 20.2.6. We also acknowledge that the future will result in a range of new and, possibly, unexpected business models we cannot currently conceive. We suggest that any new rules for GST on low value goods should be as independent as possible of the actual manner of selling the low value goods to allow for the future (currently unknown) developments in this area that are likely to occur. 20.3. We note further that within each of the above general categories are a spectrum of systems that will be affected differently by the proposed changes. For instance, while some platforms control the payment process and handle the flow of funds between consumer and underlying supplier, other platforms may facilitate payment without actually receiving or controlling any funds. It is particularly problematic to impose collection obligations on Marketplaces that do not have a part in the actual main cash flows from transactions. 20.4. Further, and perhaps most fundamentally, many Marketplaces do not take legal title over the goods sold through their platforms. To de-couple tax obligations from legal ownership of the goods is to separate the compliance burden from the recipient of (or creator of) value of the actual goods. Therefore we think lo w value goods are an appropriate situation, where provided certain conditions are satisfied, to allow the burden of GST compliance to remain the underlying legal supplier of the low value goods. 21. Taking these issues together, we recommend a two-tiered approach rebuttable presumption approach, where Inland Revenue requires ‘Approved Marketplaces’ to only provide information on suppliers and supplies made into New Zealand, with no liability to collect GST. In other words, all Marketplaces that meet the approval criteria are not required to collect GST on behalf of the underlying suppliers, but are required to provide the information necessary for Officials to be certain that offshore suppliers are correctly returning GST on imported low-value goods; and to enable Officials to identify and contact taxpayers with supplies that will exceed $60,000 \[or such lower amount as is determined to be appropriate\]. 21.1. We imagine that ‘Approved Marketplaces’ would have to satisfy Officials’ that they are able to report accurately on low-value imports through their platform to New Zealand with sufficient detail to simplify compliance procedures by Officials, and Officials would have to be comfortable in outsourcing this data- driven aspect of compliance. 21.2. Creating an ‘Approved Marketplaces’ exemption would ensure that different business models operate in a similar competitive environment, and would ensure that liability for GST sit s with the entity that has legal title of the goods at the point of sale, i.e. that the one receiving the funds for transferring legal title is the one collecting GST. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 8 21.3. ‘Approved Marketplaces’ would still be required to register for GST if its direct sales into New Zealand breach the registration threshold. 21.4. To the extent that the ‘Approved Marketplace’ has a supplier that does not comply with their New Zealand GST obligations, then following notification by Inland Revenue of the defaults, any future sales of low value goods to New Zealand customers via the ‘Approved Marketplace’ would require the ‘Approved Marketplace’ to collect GST as if they were legally sales of the marketplace. 22. We consider that this approach will be more effective because: 22.1. It balances the needs of Inland Revenue to collect GST on low value goods in a cost effective manner against the need to only impose GST on parties that are not the underlying legal suppliers of goods if absolutely necessary. 22.2. The reporting by ‘Approved Marketplaces’ will strongly incentivise underlying supplier compliance; 22.3. This lower burden on Marketplaces, provided they meet the criteria, will ensure that Marketplaces continue to find it easy to do business in / with New Zealand; 22.4. It removes GST considerations from decision-making on the best business model, recognising that digital industry depends on the certainty and simplicity of the regulatory environment; 22.5. It will balance the overall compliance cost of administering the system versus the potential tax revenues collected. As we understand the vast amount of GST is going to come from a relatively small number of larger offshore suppliers of the legal title to the low value goods; and 22.6. Recognises that digital marketplaces are a complex and dynamic environment that requires a flexible policy approach to future-proof the GST Act. 23. We also support the proposed concession to allow Marketplaces’ to act ‘as agent’ for underlying suppliers upon mutual agreement. A lower registration threshold? 24. Recognising that our proposed approach requires a concessionary stance by Officials, we submit that a lower registration threshold for offshore suppliers may counter- balance any concerns that putting liability on the underlying supplier will result in a lower level of compliance. 25. We consider that an appropriate threshold may be $30,000, though we note that this should be tested with real marketplace information from digital marketplaces to ensure that the right balance is struck between compliance costs on offshore suppliers, compliance costs for Inland Revenue and expected tax revenues. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT Page 9 Re-deliverers 26. We submit that it should be made clear that while re-delivers will be required to collect and return GST on the value of the goods being re-delivered to New Zealand, any actual charges by the re-delivery for their services should be GST zero rated when provided by a New Zealand resident, and outside scope when provided by a non-resident. 27. We do not consider that there is any real risk in a practical sense of any form of ‘value substitution’ occurring when an unrelated re-deliver is providing re-delivery services. The non-resident supplier that is delivering goods to a non-New Zealand re-deliver address will generally have no knowledge that the goods will ultimately be sent to New Zealand. Therefore there will be no ability at all for value to be transferred from the goods to the transportation costs such that GST is avoided. Other submission points Process for goods imported 28. While not a revenue issue, we note that the paper does not contain detailed guidance on how, in practice, Customs processing of goods will occur to minimise delays. While this is a systems issue for the New Zealand Customs Service, it is directly tied to the proposals contained in the discussion document. Application date 29. We recommend that Officials review the proposed application date with Marketplaces and offshore suppliers to confirm that it will provide sufficient time for the development of required business systems and operating procedures required by the proposed changes. Data-driven approach 30. We recommend that Officials seek further information and data from Marketplaces to support the policy rationale with clear evidence-based thinking. Understanding the structure of the digital market, i.e. how many suppliers supply more than $30,000 or $60,000 annually into New Zealand, or what types of business models Marketplaces are applying, etc., for low-value goods will clarify the policy choices. Concluding statement Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on these proposals and for taking the time to consider our submission. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss these further in person. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1. Electronic Marketplace definition The EMP definition can be improved. For clarity, the Electronic Marketplace (EMP) needs to have access to the information that is necessary to determine the GST treatment of a good. In this respect the definition of an EMP should evolve to mirror a recently-released definition from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). This definition can be found here: https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/e-Tax\_Guides/GST%20Taxing%20imported %20services%20by%20way%20of%20an%20overseas%20vendor%20registration%20regime.pdf Here we replicate the Singapore definition, which states that “an electronic marketplace is defined as a medium that: I. allows the suppliers to make supplies available to customers; and II. is operated by electronic means. This includes marketplaces operated via a website, internet portal, gateway, distribution platform or any other types of electronic interface, but excludes payment processors or internet service providers.” The EMP with the necessary information to comply can become liable for GST based on its contract with its merchant Therefore, we propose that the following should be added to the New Zealand definition of an EMP: “Any intermediary with the information that is necessary to determine the GST treatment and who contractually agrees to collect the GST.” RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 2. EMP liability The EMP should be liable no matter where the underlying merchant (inside New Zealand or outside) is located. It is too burdensome to make a distinction. It is the underlying New Zealand merchant that should find a way to prove that the GST due was paid. The other option is to introduce exceptions. Exceptions, however, are difficult to manage and are subject to differing interpretations. 3. Foreign exchange rates In relation to foreign exchange (FX) rates. It should be authorised that a fixed rate equivalent can be determined for the year for goods that have a price close to the threshold of NZ$400 or less (excluding GST). It should be clear who needs to collect the GST, the foreign supplier or customs. Otherwise, the responsibility to collect the GST may change from one shipment to the next. Here, the real value at the time of the supply needs to be reported on the return. However, it should be a fixed value and should be agreed upon so as to know who is liable for the collection of the GST, the vendor or customs. 4. Proof of GST Payment We agree that proof of GST charged should be automatically linked to the package so that customs can check GST charged automatically without requesting proof from the customer. An automatic, and simplified, way to implement this process is necessary. 5. Refunds due to double taxation If double taxation occurs then the refund should be made by customs with a simplified process put in place. This simplified process is required so as not to place the burden of refunds on the foreign merchant that will, in turn, also need to update their original GST return. Foreign merchants will also have to retain the proof of the double taxation that occurred. RELEASED UNDER THE OFFICIAL INFORMATION ACT 1 From: Sent:Wednesday, 2 May 2018 08:32 To: Policy Webmaster Subject: GST on low-value imported goods Dear Sir/Madam My feedback relates to the following rule: •Offshore suppliers would be required to register, collect and return GST on supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers if the value of the goods is $400 or less. Tariffs and cost recovery charges would no longer be collected on goods valued at or below this value. I propose that the value of $400 should be increased to $1,000 and the tariff and recovery charges also not collected on any goods valued at below that amount. The reason for this is the cost to overseas businesses in implementing these rules. The NZ government is proposing a requirement for GST to be collected on low value goods only – this means that the cost of implementing this for the overseas business relates to low value goods they are selling and therefore the cost to benefit is high for them. Having to charge GST on a books worth only $20 is a high price to pay to be able to supply to New Zealand consumers. In my experience most customers currently keep under that limit to ensure that GST and duties don’t also apply and I believe this will continue as duties can be very costly over the $400 value. Therefore increasing the limit will encourage and allow consumers to purchase more at once and help offset the costs the overseas business will now be incurring. The current $400 value has also not increased with inflation and buying power has therefore decreased when buying from offshore an increase would make up for this. The proposal ensures fairness for our NZ businesses and creates an equal playing field but this is not quite true as it adds a complexity that the NZ business does not have to face, increasing this level will ensure that we are not simply keeping an uneven playing filed but just changing the side that is affected the most. Finally with Australia implementing a similar scheme using the same $1,000 that they are proposing for the threshold will also reduce compliance costs for overseas businesses by keeping the schemes more aligned and leave less uncertainty over their sales.

1 Impact Summary: GST on low-value goods Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue, the New Zealand Customs Service and The Treasury are responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet and stakeholders to be consulted on a Government discussion document. 2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Completeness of analysis The analysis of the options presented in this document is not yet complete. However, this analysis will be completed before final policy decisions are made. Consultation with stakeholders, including through the Government discussion document, will inform the analysis. A key gap in the analysis to date is that estimates of potential GST revenue collections have not yet been completed for options 3 and 4. Evidence of the problem There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the foregone GST on imported low-value goods under the current de minimis 1 threshold. Quality of data used for impact analysis It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers could be required to register and return GST under the preferred option. It is also not possible to determine exactly how much GST revenue is foregone on low-value goods imported under the de minimis from offshore and consumed in New Zealand. Officials estimate, based on a ‘bottom up’ approach (using 2016 data from New Zealand Post and couriers on numbers of low-value consignments and Customs’ sample data and Australian estimates on values), that around $80 million of GST was foregone in 2016 on these purchases. This amount could be growing at a rate of 10% per annum, based on a 12% five-year average rate of growth in volumes of low-value goods and taking into account that the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower-value end. The estimated impact is dependent on the behavioural response of offshore suppliers and New Zealand consumers to the introduction of an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value goods. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis We have assumed that larger offshore supplier of goods and e-marketplaces would voluntarily comply with the proposed requirement to register and return GST , given the reputational risk involved in not complying. For the purposes of the analysis, the “compliance rate” does not refer to the proportion of offshore suppliers who would have a liability to register for GST under the preferred option, but instead the percentage of goods (by dollar value) that would be supplied by offshore suppliers who would register and voluntarily comply with the rules. For these reasons, a 75 percent compliance rate is thought to be reasonable. This assumption has been used in calculating the estimated GST revenue collections under the preferred option shown in the table in Section 4. We note that New Zealand applied GST to offshore suppliers of services in October 2016 and there has been a high level of compliance with the new rules. However, we also note that consumption of online services is more concentrated among a small number of large suppliers compared to the market for low-value goods. 1 The Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures requires setting a de minimis and New Zealand is a party to this Protocol. The current de minimis is $60 duty owing. It means no duty is collected on low-value imported goods if the total duty is less than $60. 3 If offshore suppliers and marketplaces perceive the compliance costs of registering for and returning New Zealand GST to be unreasonably high, there is a risk that they may not comply with the rules or may not continue to supply goods to New Zealand. Table 1 below shows the effect of relaxing the above compliance assumption and assuming instead a level of compliance of 50%. This is considered to be a very low compliance rate, given the proposed inclusion of rules to require e-marketplaces (some of which have a large share of the goods market) to register and return GST on goods sold to New Zealand consumers through their distribution platforms. Based on a range of compliance assumptions (50%, 75% and 100%), the numbers in Table 1 represent the estimated additional amount of GST that may be returned under the preferred option, over and above the amount of GST that would otherwise be collected at the border if the status quo was retained. These figures do not take into account the tariff revenue and border fees that are currently collected on goods valued at or below $1,000. Table 1: Additional GST revenue that may be returned by registered offshore suppliers ($ millions - fiscal year) Assumed compliance 2019/20 Application at 1 October 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 50% 20 31 35 41 75% 43 64 72 81 100% 66 97 108 121 Based on our data and assumptions, the break-even rate of compliance (where the GST returned by offshore suppliers is equal to what would otherwise be collected if the status quo is retained) would be 28 percent for the 2019/20 fiscal year. Estimated coverage rates of 85% (by value) of low-value goods sent through the fast freight stream and 70% through the postal stream have been used to take into account the effect of including rules which require marketplaces to register and return GST in respect of goods sold through those marketplaces to New Zealand consumers. The total foregone GST revenue has been calculated based on an assumption that the total value of goods under the current de minimis is growing at 10% per annum. The forecasted potential GST collections under option 2 have also been calculated on the basis of this assumption as well as the assumption that the value of GST that would otherwise be collected by Customs under the status quo collection system will continue to grow at 5% per annum on average. It is assumed that the application of GST to low-value imported goods would not have a significant impact on consumers’ purchasing behaviour. The extent to which consumers would bear the incidence of the tax if the preferred option is implemented is unknown and will depend on the rate of compliance and on whether, if registered, the offshore supplier passes the cost on to the consumer. This may be industry or firm specific and will depend on factors such as business practices and the elasticity of demand for products. It is assumed that in most cases the consumer would bear most of the incidence of the tax. 4 Consultation and testing We have undertaken a limited consultation at this stage and plan to undertake a fuller consultation with stakeholders through submissions on the discussion document and targeted meetings with key stakeholders. Responsible Managers (signature and date): Chris Gillion Anna Cook Policy Manager Director Policy Policy and Strategy Policy, Legal and Governance Inland Revenue New Zealand Customs Service 20 July 2017 20 July 2017 5 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? In principle, GST should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods, as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. However, GST is currently collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether tariffs are payable. The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. Non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. The implication of this is that domestic businesses are at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also obviously means that the Government is foregoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand; based on a five-year average, the number of imported low-value goods is growing at about 12 percent per annum and the Government is foregoing an increasing amount of GST. Foregone revenue Estimates of the foregone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated, using a top- down approach based on credit card data, a ‘maximum potential’ fore gone GST revenue figure of approximately $140 million per annum. Officials have done further work using a ‘bottom-up approach’ which indicates a lower potential fore gone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. The growth of business-to-consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value at 10 percent per year 2 , the amount of foregone GST is forecasted to grow to $127 million by 2021. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as t here are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. International developments The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. 2 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 12%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. 6 From 1 July 2018 Australia will require offshore suppliers to return GST on low-value imported goods (valued at AU$1,000 or less) . However, the Australian Productivity Commission is undertaking a review of the effectiveness of this model and of other possible GST collection models . The European Union has indicated that it intends to introduce an offshore supplier registration scheme to collect VAT on low-value goods from 2021. Singapore also announced a proposal to introduce an offshore supplier registration model for collecting GST on imported goods (valued at or below S$400) and cross-border services and intangibles. No details have yet been provided for the intended application date. The broad framework of Singapore’s proposed rules is consistent with Australia’s new rules and with the systems for cross-border intangibles and services that operate in the EU Member States, New Zealand, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Norway, Switzerland and South Africa. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The preferred option involves requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on their supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers valued at or below $1,000. At the same time, the de minimis for collecting GST and other duties on imported goods at the border would be increased to $1,000 to reflect the fact that GST would now be collected on these goods at the point of sale (rather than at the border). Government The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST and forego tariffs. Cost recovery fees which fund Customs’ and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ risk management activities at the border would also be foregone and would presumably be replaced by additional Crown funding. In 2016, the amount of tariffs collected was $5.2 million and cost recovery fees were $17 million. Domestic businesses New Zealand-based retailers are in favour of levying GST on low-value imported goods as they are concerned that the non-collection of GST places them at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Footwear and clothing manufactures would be affected by the removal of tariff duty on footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold. The impacts on the different parties along the supply chain (offshore suppliers, fast freight New Zealand Post and consumers) are detailed below. Offshore suppliers and online marketplaces Offshore suppliers (including e-marketplaces) meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of registering and returning GST. Smaller suppliers who fall below this registration threshold would be unaffected (provided that they are certain that they are below the threshold). 7 It is possible that some smaller suppliers may not know if they might realistically make supplies to New Zealand consumers exceeding the $60,000 registration threshold and therefore may prefer to stop supplying to New Zealand customers rather than go through the exercise of figuring out whether they are liable to register (and then registering for GST if they are). However, it is expected that a lot of these smaller suppliers would sell their goods through an e-marketplace, in which case the marketplace would bear the compliance costs of registering and returning GST. E- marketplaces may be more likely to accept these compliance costs due to their greater resources and larger overall share of the market. Fast freight Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and fees on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This would generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. New Zealand Post Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. Consumers Costs and savings Under the preferred option, consumers would pay GST on imported goods under the current de minimis (which they currently would not pay any GST or other duty on ) where these goods are supplied by a registered offshore supplier. This means that in some instances they would pay more overall for a low-value good purchased from an offshore business. However, this will not be the case if they purchase a low-value good from a supplier that does not meet the $60,000 registration threshold. Some imported goods valued between $400 and $1000, on which GST and other duty is currently collected, would become cheaper for consumers as a result of the proposal to not collect tariffs and border fees. As a result of foregoing tariffs and border fees on goods with a value of $1,000 or less, low-value goods will also be processed through the border faster, resulting in consumers seeing improvements in the timeliness of delivery. Access to goods As long as offshore suppliers’ compliance costs are kept to an acceptable minimum through simplified rules , it is not expected that the preferred option would significantly restrict consumers’ access to goods from offshore. However, there is a possibility of reduced access to goods if offshore suppliers and e- marketplaces refuse to supply goods to New Zealand customers as a result of the proposal. During the May 2017 Australian Senate inquiry on Australia’s new offs hore supplier registration system, e-Bay expressed opposition to the proposal and noted that it might geo- block Australian consumers from buying goods on its platform. It should be noted, however, that the then-proposed implementation date for the proposal was 1 July 2017 which, according to submitters, did not allow offshore suppliers and e- marketplaces enough time to prepare for the changes so that they could comply with the new rules. As a result of the concerns expressed by submitters and the lack of consideration of other options, the application date for the legislation was delayed to 1 July 2018. 8 Increased certainty and simplicity The elimination of tariff duties and border fees on goods valued at or below $1,000 coupled with the supplier charging GST at the point of sale would provide consumers with greater certainty of the total cost of their imported goods compared with the status quo. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? An option where financial intermediaries are responsible for returning GST on credit card purchases of low-value goods from offshore was briefly considered and quickly ruled out. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered this option and it was thought to be not fe asible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to determine if a good or service was supplied by an offshore supplier (and if they did, they likely would not to be able to tell if it was consumed overseas or in New Zealand). Options 1, 3 and 4 (see below) were being analysed by Customs, Inland Revenue and the Treasury as part of the policy development process, but Ministers decided that the Government discussion document would focus only on the offshore supplier registration option (option 2). The main reason for this is because it is the most efficient method of collecting GST on low value goods, and because other countries, particularly Australia, seem to be moving towards offshore supplier registration as an option for collecting GST/VAT on low-value imports (which means that New Zealand may benefit from following these early adopters) . The benefits to New Zealand of international consistency in the adoption of an offshore supplier registration system are discussed further in Section 3. One interdependency is with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade’s ongoing work on tariffs. Under the preferred option, tariffs would be not be collected on imported goods with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs’ border risk management and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ current biosecurity processes are reliant on information about the content of low-value goods . For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Data from tariff codes are used by the Ministry for Primary Industries and Customs to risk assess consignments at the border. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and the Ministry of Primary Industries’ risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border, as well as Customs’ revenue collection activities) from goods with a value of $1,000 or less. 9 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The overarching objectives of this project are to improve the collection of GST on low-value imported goods and, in doing so, to ensure competitive neutrality, so that the GST treatment of low-value imported goods is no different to goods sold domestically. This requires the consideration of the usual tax policy objectives such as the broad-base, low rate framework, efficiency of collection and sustainability of GST revenue. This work also requires the balancing of wider Government objectives against these tax policy objectives. These wider Government objectives include minimising as far as is practicable any reduction in consumer welfare associated with the broadening of the GST base, as well as Customs’ and the Ministry of Primary Industries’ objective of maintaining the current levels of border protection. To be effective in addressing the problem identified, it is necessary that the chosen solution must perform well against our tax policy objectives. However, because of the Government’s wider objectives, strong performance against the tax policy objectives is not sufficient in itself; therefore, possible impacts related to consumer welfare, border risk management and biosecurity must also factor into the analysis. The following key has been used for assessing how well the options perform against these objectives, compared with the status quo:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo Three policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: • Option 1: Retain the current GST and tariff duty collection processes where no GST or tariff duty is collected at the border on goods below the de minimis. This is the status quo option which the other options are being assessed against. • Option 2: Require offshore suppliers to register for, collect and return GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand resident customers and remove tariff duty and border fees from goods valued at or below $1,000. • Option 3: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST and tariff duty on low-value goods purchased from offshore suppliers (known as a “pay after delivery” or “reverse charge” mechanism). • Option 4: Require fast freight courier companies and New Zealand Post to collect GST and tariff duty on imported goods above a lowered de minimis. The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: Administrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as practicable. 10 • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the foregone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about. Counteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. Option 1: Status quo Assessment against objectives Foregone GST (2016) Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection $80 million Does not meet Meets Meets Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity Under the status quo, consumers pay GST on imported goods to Customs if the total duty on the good (including GST and tariffs) is $60 or more. $400 is commonly understood as the value at which a parcel is likely to be assessed for revenue by Customs and is based on the assumption that GST is the only duty applying to the good. In some instances, the current system is not simple or certain for consumers to interact with. For example, a consumer that imports a good valued between $226 and $400 on which tariff duty of 10% applies might be surprised to discover that they are liable to pay GST, tariff duty and a cost recovery fee to Customs if they want their good to be released. Efficiency of compliance The status quo does not impose compliance costs on offshore suppliers of goods. When consumers import goods above the de minimis, they are required to enter into a second transaction to pay the GST and border fees (and tariff duty, if applicable) on their goods to Customs. They are also likely experience delays associated with the collection of revenue on their goods. Fast freight courier companies currently collect GST on goods above the de minimis where these goods are sent through the fast freight stream, which imposes some administrative costs on them. New Zealand Post incurs costs in checking consignments over the de minimis. Efficiency of administration Increasing volumes of low-value goods place pressure on the current revenue collection processes, some of which are manual and resource intensive. Unless better information, particularly in the postal stream, becomes available, there are logistical challenges and costs involved with managing increasing volumes. Fairness and equity The current tax collection process places domestic businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore businesses that can supply low-value goods directly to New Zealand consumers without the imposition of GST. 11 Sustainability and neutrality The issues of competitive neutrality would remain unaddressed and are likely to worsen over time if the growth in online shopping for low-value goods continues to grow more rapidly than domestic spending on consumer goods. Incremental improvements to efficiency of collection under the current system will become possible over time with better data availability (including advance parcel data from the postal system); however, it is uncertain that this will be enough to be sustainable in the long term, given the existing pressures on the system and the rate of growth in parcel volumes. In the medium term, increased system pressures (including delivery delays for consumers) are likely if investment in border processing capacity is not made or lags behind the growth in online shopping. Option 2: Offshore supplier registration (preferred option) Assessment against objectives and status quo Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection $43 million in 2019/20, expected to grow to $81 million in 2022/23    Under this option, tariff revenue and border fees would not be collected on goods with a value of $1,000 or less. GST would not be collected from offshore suppliers who make total supplies to New Zealand consumers below the $60,000 GST registration threshold in a 12-month period. The collection would also be impacted by the level of compliance. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity This system is widely used internationally for taxing cross-border services and domestic supplies. It should therefore be familiar to international suppliers who supply both services and goods or who are resident in countries with a VAT or GST. Australia has recently enacted legislation which will apply GST to low-value goods supplied by non-residents using an offshore supplier registration system from 1 July 2018. If this option is implemented in New Zealand from 1 October 2019, a number of suppliers may have already registered and returned GST under Australia’s rules by this time, so they would already be familiar with such a system for goods. New Zealand’s GST system is broad-based, with a single rate and almost no exemptions for goods, and therefore should be relatively simple for offshore suppliers to comply with. However, there will be more GST collection entities compared to the status quo. The charging of GST by the supplier at the point of sale, coupled with the removal of tariff duties and border fees on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 would provide increased upfront certainty for consumers regarding the total cost to them of the goods they import. 12 Efficiency of compliance This option would impose compliance costs on offshore suppliers, most of whom would not be required at present to interact with New Zealand’s GST system. However, compliance costs to offshore suppliers should be relatively minimal because New Zealand’s GST system is simple compared to other VAT/GST systems around the world. However, there could be significant upfront IT system upgrade costs. Implementing simplified registration processes and other rules aimed at minimising compliance costs are expected to keep compliance costs to an acceptable minimum for the majority of the large offshore suppliers who are well- resourced and who are more likely to have IT systems in place that have the capability to account for GST on supplies to New Zealand consumers. There would be administration cost savings to courier companies, who would no longer collect GST on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000, but will have to provide information to Customs for border and biosecurity risk management. Efficiency of administration This option is relatively efficient to administer given systems are already in place to register offshore suppliers of cross-border services as well as domestic suppliers. There would be modest administration cost savings to Customs. Fairness and equity Offshore suppliers would be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. Consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase low-value goods from a domestic or offshore supplier as both suppliers would be required to return GST on that supply. Sustainability and neutrality From a tax policy standpoint, this option is neutral because offshore suppliers would be subject to the same GST rules that apply to domestic suppliers (including the $60,000 registration threshold which applies in the domestic context). The sustainability and neutrality of this option in practice depends on the extent to which liable offshore suppliers comply with the rules. Failure on the part of large international suppliers of low value goods (including the prominent marketplaces) to comply with their tax obligations would pose a significant reputational risk to these suppliers. Where similar rules have been applied in other countries to tax cross-border services and intangibles, offshore suppliers have demonstrated a willingness to comply. This has been the experience in New Zealand so far with the new GST rules for cross-border services and intangibles. It is therefore expected that the majority of the largest offshore suppliers would voluntarily comply. We do not know yet if consumers’ access to goods would be significantly reduced. Delivery times may also be shorter, or at least would not be any slower than under the status quo. Option 3: Pay after delivery/reverse charge Assessment against objectives Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection Not estimated    13 Because of the compliance and administrative costs involved with this option, it is likely that a de minimis threshold would still be required. GST would be collected on all goods above the de minimis which, it is expected, could be set at a much lower level than the effective de minimis (where GST is the only duty applying) under the current collection system of $400. Under this option, all goods above the de minimis are liable to GST (unlike option 2). However, because consumers receive their goods before they make payment, the level of compliance could potentially be low. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity A large number of taxpayers would be required to return GST, compared with the status quo and with options 2 and 4 where a relatively small number of offshore suppliers or postal/freight carriers would be required to return the GST. At present, most individuals are not required to file personal income tax returns because their income (for instance, from salary, wages or interest) is withheld at source. Given that a large number of individual taxpayers are not currently required to interact with the tax system by filing tax returns or by directly making payments of tax themselves to Inland Revenue, this option may not be simple for some individuals to comply with. This option could potentially be as simple as paying a parking ticket or a road toll, but compliance may be a major issue. Efficiency of compliance As mentioned above, this option would impose compliance costs on a relatively large group of consumers and for relatively small amounts of GST. Efficiency of administration Administrative costs are also likely to be significant as this option would involve the development of a new system of receiving GST payments. Resources would also need to be allocated to ensuring consumers complied with their tax obligations, by promoting awareness, providing guidance materials and dealing with enquiries, errors and refunds. Fairness and equity The fairness of this option depends on the extent to which consumers comply with the rules, and, where there is non-compliance, whether the penalties are proportionate to the offence. If there is widespread non-compliance, then this option would do little to address the existing fairness issue where domestic retailers are at a competitive disadvantage because of the non-collection of GST on imported goods. Whether consumers would be required to pay GST on gifts they have received from overseas and the fairness implications of requiring them (or not requiring them) to do so would also need to be considered. Sustainability and neutrality If applied consistently and successfully, GST would be returned on both goods provided domestically and from offshore. However, the method of collection would differ significantly depending on whether the supplier was offshore or onshore. 14 This option would at least not reduce consumers’ access to goods supplied from offshore and would not lead to any revenue-related delays in delivery. However, when this option has been applied in other jurisdictions to tax cross-border services received by consumers, its success has been limited. This is likely due to a number of factors such as lack of awareness of the requirement to return GST given that consumers are accustomed to GST being included in the purchase price, and the potential difficulty of enforcing a reverse charge on such a large taxpayer base. In some cases, the New Zealand purchaser may not realise they are buying from a non- resident supplier. For example, an offshore supplier could have a New Zealand domain name (.co.nz) or a separate chain of New Zealand retail stores. A system could however be put in place where parcels on which GST is required to be paid are identified by Customs at the border and stickers instructing the recipient how to pay the GST are placed on the parcels. Option 4: Post and courier companies collect the GST Assessment against objectives Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection Not estimated    Under this option, tariff revenue and border fees would continue to be collected on low-value goods above a de minimis threshold. GST would be collected on all goods above the de minimis, and it could be lowered at some point in time; however, the magnitude and timing of a potential reduction in the de minimis is not yet clear. Under this option there is expected to be relatively high collection above the de minimis for goods sent through the fast freight stream; however, undervaluation of goods shipped through the postal stream (of which there are a significant number) is rife and, in the medium term, is likely to go undetected due to the lack of advance data for these parcels. However, where goods are identified as requiring payment of duty, compliance by consumers in paying the GST and other duty would be high like it is under the status quo, since the goods are not delivered until payment is made. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity The rules should be simple for couriers to understand and comply with, as they already have systems in place for collecting and remitting the GST to government. However, such a system would not be simple for New Zealand Post to comply with in the medium term. As postal systems do not currently provide for the collection of advance data on imported goods, the postal system cannot yet efficiently implement this option, although there are a number of developments occurring that will allow for this in the future. Therefore, this option would not be likely to lead to increased simplicity and certainty compared with the status quo. 15 Efficiency of compliance A reduced de minimis under this option would increase administrative costs for couriers, and for New Zealand Post in particular. Post and fast freight would likely collect a similar amount of revenue at a similar cost to the status quo collection mechanism with a lowered de minimis. Therefore, while this option would reduce administration costs for government, these costs would be shifted to courier companies and New Zealand Post. Efficiency of administration Administration costs for Customs would be lower than under the status quo. Fairness and equity The extent to which this option would improve competitive neutrality is dependent on the extent to which the de minimis can be reduced. Sustainability and neutrality If the de minimis could be reduced significantly to a low level, this approach may capture a high proportion of the foregone GST revenue and could therefore go a long way towards addressing the current distortion. However, as stated above, a significant reduction to the de minimis would not be feasible in the medium term. This option is likely to result in further delivery delays for consumers compared with the status quo. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The preferred option is option 2, offshore supplier registration. It is the preferred option because it is a low-cost option for collecting GST on low-value goods (in terms of both administration and compliance costs), and because it meets the objectives of simplicity and certainty, neutrality, effectiveness, fairness and sustainability and is coherent within the overall GST framework. It also follows the international precedent being set by Australia, which Singapore intends to follow and which the EU intends to implement in 2021. The proposed approach would address the problems identified by making offshore suppliers of low- value goods subject to the same GST rules as those that domestic suppliers and offshore suppliers of cross-border services are required to comply with. This would therefore ensure that GST is liable to be charged on imported goods below the current de minimis if the goods are supplied by a supplier who is liable to register. However, the level of compliance could potentially be an issue. Compliance might be better assured under the option where courier companies and New Zealand Post collect duty on goods above a lowered de minimis, as the consumer would not receive the goods until payment is made. However, it is likely that there would be more foregone revenue as a result of undervaluation under this option, compared with option 2. 3 Implementing this option with a lower de minimis would also be challenging without new technology and systems, including advance data in the postal stream, and it is not certain how much the de minimis could be reduced by and when. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 3 Where GST might not be collected at present as a result of undervaluation by the supplier, this currently foregone GST revenue may be collected under an offshore supplier registration system in cases where an e- marketplace is responsible for returning the GST instead of the underlying supplier. 16 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The costs to offshore suppliers would include registering for GST (one-off), altering business systems to account for GST on goods sold to New Zealand consumers (one-off), and returns filing (ongoing). It is assumed that compliance would be high, based on the experience so far with the GST rules for cross-border services and intangibles. Potentially high upfront systems and low ongoing compliance costs for offshore suppliers above the $60,000 of NZ sales registration threshold Regulators The implementation costs to Inland Revenue are estimated to be up to $460,000. This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low- value goods and other minor systems changes. It also allows for an increase in the volume of work for staff currently processing registrations. Loss of revenue from border fees to Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries Up to $0.46m Approximately $17m in border fees and likely to increase in coming years with the increasing volume of low-value goods. Wider government The government would forego tariff revenue collected on low-value goods and Crown funding would be required for border fees foregone by the Ministry for Primary Industries and Customs. Approximately $5.2m per year and likely to increase in coming years with increasing volume of low-value goods. Other parties Consumers would likely pay more for imported goods that are currently below the de minimis. Some consumers may pay less because of the proposed removal of tariff duty and border fe es. The availability of some goods from overseas may also decrease. $43m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2019/20 fiscal year $64m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2020/21 fiscal year $72m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2021/22 fiscal year $81m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2022/23 fiscal year 17 Total Monetised Cost Up to $66m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $87m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $95m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $104m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Non-monetised costs Potential lower efficiency of the domestic retail market due to reduction in competitive advantage to offshore suppliers, which may lead to reduced competition from offshore.

Reduction in costs to New Zealand Post Possible reduction in delivery delays and increased simplicity and certainty for consumers regarding the total cost to them of their imported low-value goods. Increased competitive neutrality between domestic retailers and offshore suppliers. Unable to estimate 18 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Offshore suppliers would be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. This will be a new compliance regime for offshore suppliers. The application of GST to imported goods below the current de minimis may reduce the demand for such goods. A study by UMR Research shows that consumers are price sensitive, particularly at the lower-value end. 4 However, the extent to which the collection of GST on the se goods would reduce consumer demand is likely to be influenced by other factors, such as the domestic availability of the goods. Where the GST-exclusive price of a good (including delivery costs) is the same regardless of whether it is supplied domestically or from offshore, consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase it from the domestic retailer or from the offshore supplier, assuming no difference in quality and delivery times. This is because both suppliers would be required to return GST on the supply of that good if both suppliers are above the registration threshold (which, due to the proposed inclusion of marketplace rules, is likely to be the case in most instances). The removal of tariff and cost recovery charges on some goods and faster processing times may increase demand for goods valued between $400 and $1,000. The preferred strategy, as with the rest of the New Zealand tax system, is to rely primarily on voluntary compliance. It is however recognised that some consumers may be incentivised to buy from suppliers who do not charge GST on their purchases. Some suppliers may try to avoid detection as being liable to register by shifting their method of transporting their goods from freight to the postal system where the quality of parcel data is much poorer than in the fast freight stream. 4 http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/legal/Documents/UMR-Report-NZ-Customs-consumer- motivation-for-purchases-of-low-value-goods.pdf Total Monetised Benefit $43m for the 2019/20 fiscal year $64m for the 2020/21 fiscal year $72m for the 2021/22 fiscal year $81m for the 2022/23 fiscal year Non-monetised benefits Medium 19 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Meetings with some stakeholders, including New Zealand Post, the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carries (CAPEC 5 ), Consumer NZ and Retail NZ have been held. At the time of drafting this Regulatory Impact Assessment, these stakeholders are not aware of the upcoming release of a discussion document proposing an offshore supplier registration system. CAPEC and New Zealand Post have not been consulted specifically on the analysis and the proposed approach. However, they have flagged their opposition to immediately lowering the de minimis under the status quo. Retail industry groups such as Booksellers NZ and Retail NZ are in favour of an offshore supplier registration system , however the proposed waiver of tariffs and border clearance levies may influence their position. Officials also met with representatives from a technology company in July 2017 which has developed a system that could be used for collecting GST from consumers after the delivery of the goods. This company is therefore in favour of the pay after delivery/reverse charge option. Offshore suppliers of low-value goods and domestic consumers have not been consulted yet. Their views about the analysis of the problem and proposed option will be sought through the submission process for the discussion document. 5 An industry body representing four courier companies – DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS 20 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposed option will require legislative change and would be largely based on the system that has applied to cross-border services and intangibles since 1 October 2016. The option will also require regulatory changes to the current border management arrangements. This will be considered as part of final policy decisions, and will be considered further in a later Regulatory Impact Assessment. Subject to consultation and final policy decisions, the proposal is likely to come into effect in 2019 which is expected to provide sufficient preparation time for offshore suppliers. 21 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. This will be considered further in a later Regulatory Impact Statement after final policy decisions have been made. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme.
Impact Statement Template | 1 Coversheet: GST on low-value imported goods Advising agencies Inland Revenue, New Zealand Customs Service Decision sought Final policy approval Proposing Ministers Hon Grant Robertson (Minister of Finance), Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) and Hon Kris Faafoi (Acting Minister of Customs) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). The problem under consideration is how to implement the proposed system in a way that imposes as little deadweight cost as possible on the parties involved and in the least distortionary way possible, while also maximising voluntary compliance. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The taxing point for imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is proposed to be the point of sale (as opposed to being at the border, as is presently the case for consignments between the Customs de minimis 1 and $1,000). This means that non-resident suppliers (as well as electronic marketplaces and “re-deliverers”) 2 would be required to register for, collect, return and remit GST on their sales of goods valued at or below $1,000. This is considered to be the most feasible and cost-effective collection option at this time. Requiring offshore suppliers to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. The reason for this preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on making the rules as simple as possible for the parties involved in order to minimise aggregate compliance costs. 1 The Customs de minimis is defined as the minimum amount of “duty” collectable (which includes GST), as opposed to the maximum value of a consignment on which duty is not collected. The de minimis is $60, meaning that if the amount of GST and duties on a consignment is less than $60, revenue and cost recovery charges are not collected on that consignment. 2 An electronic marketplace, such as a website, app or internet portal, is commonly used by sellers to market and sell their products to buyers. Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier of the goods (or the marketplace) does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The most common scenario is that the goods are instead shipped to an overseas mailbox from which the re-deliverer collects the goods and ships them to New Zealand, but the re-deliverer definition would also include businesses providing personal shopper services. Impact Statement Template | 2 Customs prefers an approach whereby offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $400. Under Customs’ preferred approach, Customs would continue to collect GST and other charges on imported consignments valued above $400. Customs prefers this approach because it is estimated to collect $303 million of additional GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold. The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under a $1,000 threshold, and Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: • Government: The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST, estimated to be $66 million for the 2019/20 fiscal year (assuming a 1 October 2019 application date). However the Government may incur a fiscal cost of approximately $17.795 million per annum (based on the 2017/18 year) in replacing funding for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) that is currently cost-recovered by the two agencies under existing arrangements, depending on final decisions. The Government would also forgo tariffs (of up to $3.2 million per annum based on the 2017/18 year) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. • Domestic retailers: Collecting GST on low-value imported goods may in some cases help to improve New Zealand-based retailers’ ability to compete with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. • Fast freight: Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This is expected to generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. • New Zealand Post: Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. • Consumers: While consumers as a whole are unambiguously worse off, some consumers would benefit from the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from imported consignments between the de minimis and $1,000. • Businesses importing low-value goods: Businesses that import low-value consignments would also benefit from the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Impact Statement Template | 3 Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Consumers: Consumers would pay GST on imported goods valued at less than $400 which they previously would not have paid any GST or duties on under the current border collection system. Suppliers’ compliance costs may also be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices (over and above the amount of the tax itself). There is also a risk that consumer choice may be adversely affected if suppliers cease to offer shipping of goods to delivery addresses in New Zealand. Consumers may also experience delays in receiving goods if Customs and MPI require increased physical inspections as a consequence of a potential decrease in the reliability of information provided to Customs for border and biosecurity risk assessment. • Suppliers (including electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers): Suppliers meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of making the necessary systems changes and implementing new processes, registering, filing GST returns and remitting the GST to Inland Revenue. Suppliers selling through electronic marketplaces would not be required to register and return GST to Inland Revenue if their non-marketplace sales to New Zealand consumers are less than $60,000, as the operator of the electronic marketplace would be the entity responsible for registering and returning GST on sales made by third parties through its marketplace. In these situations, the marketplace operator may pass its compliance costs on to the underlying suppliers. • New Zealand-based manufacturers: Footwear and clothing manufacturers may be adversely affected by the removal of tariffs on imported footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold (given that the few remaining tariffs are mostly on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries). However, these industries have already had to adapt to the increasing non-collection of tariffs, as the phased implementation of New Zealand’s free trade agreements mean that the amount of tariffs that would otherwise be collected if no action is taken would be decreasing over time anyway. • Customs and MPI: Cost recovery charges 3 which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk management activities at the border would be forgone on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. This would exacerbate an existing funding shortfall for Customs and MPI until a new cost recovery regime is put in place, unless Crown funding is provided to replace the lost cost-recovered funding. Customs and MPI may also incur costs should the quality of data associated with entries diminish resulting in increased physical inspection of goods. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Risk of suppliers and electronic marketplaces ceasing to offer shipping to New Zealand delivery addresses: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non-resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may 3 The Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy. Impact Statement Template | 4 not continue to ship goods to New Zealand delivery addresses. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 4 The inclusion of rules that impose the liability to register for and return GST on operators of electronic marketplaces in respect of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers by non-resident suppliers should help to mitigate the risk of smaller suppliers ceasing to ship to New Zealand, as many of these suppliers would be selling to New Zealand through an electronic marketplace. Officials’ preferred options that are outlined in this Regulatory Impact Assessment include measures that are intended to simplify the requirements for non-resident suppliers, operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers as much as possible, which should help to reduce this risk. • Competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses: There is a risk that the addition of GST to the prices of goods offered to consumers by compliant businesses may result in a competitive advantage for other businesses that would not be required to register and return GST (or that would not comply with the rules if liable to register). The inclusion of rules that would deem operators of electronic marketplaces to be the suppliers of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces by non-residents should help to minimise this risk by improving compliance with the rules. This would however result in GST being collected on goods supplied by non-residents that would not otherwise be required to be returned if these suppliers sold goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website. It is a possibility that this may potentially create a competitive disadvantage for compliant marketplace operators. However, this risk is not thought to be significant given the market dominance of the large electronic marketplaces. • Quality of import entry information for biosecurity and border risk assessment: The preferred option may reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information (as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments below $1,000), which may have adverse consequences for the management of biosecurity and other border risks. Customs and MPI will monitor any impacts on the management of border and biosecurity risks. • Undervaluation of goods by suppliers or importers for Customs purposes: Compared with the existing de minimis, a $1,000 threshold may exacerbate the existing issue of undervaluation in relation to high-value consignments. This may not have a significant impact on net GST collections on imported consignments valued above $1,000 (as the vast majority of imported goods above $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses), but this could have adverse implications for the collection of tariffs and 4 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Impact Statement Template | 5 cost recovery charges on high-value consignments. • Potential behavioural changes by consumers: Compared with the existing de minimis, the $1,000 threshold may also incentivise consumers to purchase goods valued between $400 and $1,000 free of GST/VAT from offshore retailers that would be below the registration threshold. It is difficult to say how significant this risk may be, since it is expected that many larger offshore retailers that ship goods to New Zealand would be above the registration threshold, and it is unclear how many smaller offshore suppliers below the registration threshold would sell goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website or mail order. Consumers may also be incentivised to arrange for friends or family members in foreign countries to buy goods for them and reimburse the friend or family member. However, whether this would necessarily be cost-effective is uncertain, as it is likely to be the case that the consumer would end up paying foreign VAT, GST or sales tax if they arrange for a friend or family member to buy the goods and ship the goods to them. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Analysing the impact of the proposals on offshore suppliers has been constrained by the lack of data and information available. Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using retail banking data for the 2017/18 fiscal year supplied by Datamine. Online transactions were identified using a range of methods, including by identifying whether a card was present for a transaction and isolating transactions with known e-commerce only retailers. To exclude services and intangibles and the likes of tax payments, only transactions with merchant category codes clearly related to goods retail were included. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The Treasury, Inland Revenue Department and New Zealand Customs Quality Assurance Assessment: A joint panel from The Treasury, Inland Revenue and Customs considers that the Regulatory Impact Assessment partially meets the quality criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIS could probably be clearer and more concise, particularly as to the nature and implications of the agency disagreement as to the value threshold below which offshore Impact Statement Template | 6 suppliers would be required to collect GST. However, it seems unlikely that this would make the decision itself any more clear-cut, since the adoption of either threshold will entail downsides as well as upsides. It is also evident that consumer and supplier behaviour will be a major driver of the outcome in practice, particularly in terms of revenue collected. It will therefore be important, as set out in the RIS, to collect data and information from different sources, including experience in other jurisdictions, to inform ongoing monitoring and possibly review of the new approach. Impact Statement Template | 7 Impact Statement: GST on low-value imported goods Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service are responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Impact Statement Template | 8 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints on the analysis are as follows: • Range of options considered: The Government has already made a decision that it intends to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). Options considered are therefore focussed on the key design settings for that particular collection model (as opposed to considering alternative collection models), including the level of the low-value goods threshold. • Evidence of the problem: There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the forgone GST revenue. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine suggests a potential forgone revenue figure on imported goods below the de minimis for the 2017/18 fiscal year of approximately $130 million, which is assumed to be growing at a rate of around 11.9 percent each year. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers may register and comply under the preferred option. A crude estimate may be obtained by reference to the number of entities that have registered under Australia’s new GST legislation (which is based on essentially the same collection model). However, registrations are continuing to be processed in Australia, which means that the eventual number of registrants in Australia may be significantly more than the 721 entities that had registered as of 10 July 2018. While there is data on how much GST is collected by Customs on imported goods, it is not possible to determine the net amount of GST collected on imported goods as many consignments are imported by GST-registered businesses that are able to claim the GST back from Inland Revenue. This means the potential fiscal risk of increasing the threshold above which GST is collected on consignments at the border and below which non-resident suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re- deliverers are responsible for returning GST cannot be precisely quantified. • Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: The Government’s proposed approach is estimated to increase GST revenue by approximately $66 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, increasing to $100 million and $112 million in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 fiscal years respectively. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast is that it assumes static behaviour on the part of both suppliers and consumers. However, the imposition of GST on low-value imported goods may decrease consumers’ propensity to buy goods from offshore, and may also decrease suppliers’ willingness to ship goods to New Zealand, further increasing costs of importing goods for consumers. Another key limitation is that the revenue forecast assumes for simplicity a 100 percent collection rate under the existing border collection system in relation to consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. The limitation of this assumption is that it is clear that undervaluation by suppliers is an issue to some extent, but the exact scale of the problem and the amount of GST forgone as a result are unknown. • Time constraints: Ministers have decided to plan for the introduction of the proposed rules on 1 October 2019. The proposals are therefore required to be included in a bill introduced before the end of 2018 to give affected businesses sufficient certainty about how the rules will operate. Impact Statement Template | 9 Responsible Managers: Chris Gillion Anna Cook Policy Manager Director Policy Policy and Strategy Policy, Legal and Governance Inland Revenue New Zealand Customs Service 5 September 2018 5 September 2018 Impact Statement Template | 10 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant (retail banking data supplied by Datamine indicates that New Zealand consumers spent approximately $870 million online on goods from offshore suppliers in 2017/18). The implication of this is that domestic businesses may be at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also means that the Government is forgoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand, and this forgone revenue is increasing over time. Based on a seven-year average, the number of imported consignments valued below $400 is growing at about 17 percent per annum. In response to these issues, the Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Border collection system GST is currently collected by the New Zealand Customs Service on imported consignments on which at least $60 of “duty” (including GST) is collectable. In practice this means that GST is not collected on imported consignments with a value below $400 (including freight and insurance) if GST is the only duty owing (which is typically the case). However, where the goods are subject to tariffs, the insurance and freight-inclusive value of the goods may be as low as $226, depending on the applicable tariff rate and the amount of international freight and insurance charges. 5 Customs’ and MPI’s border risk and biosecurity activities are funded by the collection of cost recovery charges on imported consignments above the de minimis. Work to date has shown that a substantial reduction in the current de minimis (from $60 of duty) is not feasible in the short term as the marginal costs of collection under the existing system would outweigh the additional revenue collected. The extent to which the de minimis may eventually be reduced in a cost-effective way under the current system or under a model where fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post collect the GST is also uncertain, as is the likely timing of such a reduction in the de minimis. Other interested agencies (from a trade, competition or consumer affairs standpoint) are the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), who were all consulted during the process of drafting this Regulatory 5 This consignment value of $226 assumes that the applicable tariff rate is the maximum 10 percent rate and that there are no clearly separable freight and insurance charges. Impact Statement Template | 11 Impact Assessment. Offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on remote services The preferred option builds upon the existing system that has been successfully implemented since 1 October 2016 for the collection of GST on cross-border supplies of “remote” services, including supplies of digital services and intangibles such as streaming services and software. At the time of designing the rules, policy officials had conservatively estimated the total forgone GST revenue to be around $40 million and that around 100 businesses might register. Since implementation, the rules have been performing better than initial expectations, with $131 million in revenue being collected under these rules for the 2017/18 tax year (the year covering 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018) with over 200 businesses registered to date. This more than favourably compares with other jurisdictions’ experience with implementing similar rules for the collection of consumption taxes on cross- border services and intangibles. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST as a broad-based consumption tax should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods. This helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple, as opposed to being a tax that distorts competition by creating biases in consumers’ or businesses’ behaviour or which collects little revenue by only collecting on a narrow tax base. At present, GST is collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis 6 and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether or not tariffs are payable. The non- collection of GST is problematic because the growth in online purchases from offshore suppliers means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is large and growing, and so is the amount of forgone revenue. Forgone revenue Estimates of the forgone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated a ‘maximum potential’ forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $140 million per annum using credit card data. Officials did further work in 2016 using a mixed dataset including Customs sample data on import values, as well as data on volumes from New Zealand Post and fast freight carriers and Australian estimates of the split between business and consumer purchases. This work indicated a lower potential forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. More recently, Inland Revenue has estimated using retail banking data that approximately $130 million in GST revenue was forgone in 2017. This more recent figure is considered to be more robust than previous estimates, as the use of merchant category codes and proxies for identifying online-only transactions should mean that the dataset roughly consists only of online purchases of goods from offshore suppliers. A limitation of the 2015 estimate is that an assumption had to be made about the split between spending on goods versus spending on services and intangibles. The main limitation of the 6 The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. Impact Statement Template | 12 2017 estimate (based on a mixed dataset including Customs’ sample data) is that its reliance on declared values may produce an estimate that is lower than the actual forgone revenue, as suppliers may be incentivised under the current system to under-declare values. The growth in direct consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount of forgone GST is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value of goods imported below the de minimis is 11.9 percent per year 7 , the amount of forgone GST is forecasted to grow to $183 million by 2021 if no action is taken. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as there are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The following options were considered and ruled out by ministers: • Collection between the point of sale and delivery by transporters: fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post would collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on goods above a lowered de minimis (“extended status quo” or “transporter model”). • Collection after delivery: consumers would pay GST directly to the government after delivery of the goods (“pay after delivery” or a “consumer reverse charge”). These options were also considered by officials in a previous Regulatory Impact Assessment in July 2017 and by the Tax Working Group (the TWG). The TWG recommended that the Government implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low- value imported goods, noting that practical concerns with options to collect GST between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery mean these two options may not be feasible in the short term. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered an option where financial intermediaries, such as credit card companies and other payment processing intermediaries, would be responsible for remitting GST on online purchases of low-value imported goods. This option was considered to be unlikely to be feasible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to precisely determine in all cases whether the payment was for goods or services (or both), or whether the goods or services were purchased while the consumer was overseas. Another limitation is that where the payment for the goods is made to a New Zealand-based entity (such as a resident marketplace), there would not be sufficient information about whether the underlying supplier of the goods is based offshore or not. Interdependencies with ongoing work Customs’ border risk management and MPI’s current biosecurity processes are reliant on 7 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 17%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. Impact Statement Template | 13 information about the content of low-value goods. For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Import entry data are used by MPI and Customs to risk-assess consignments at the border. This means that these existing information requirements would need to remain in place under the preferred option, even though this information would not be used for the collection of GST or tariff duty on low-value imported goods. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and MPI, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border) from imported consignments with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs is currently reviewing its cost recovery arrangement and will report back on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding in the context of that review. MPI expects to report to Cabinet on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding at the time of final policy decisions by Cabinet on the GST on low-value imported goods proposals. Both MFAT and MBIE carry out work which has implications for New Zealand’s tariff policy. Impact Statement Template | 14 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are consumers, non-resident suppliers of low-value goods, operators of electronic marketplaces, re-deliverers, the fast freight industry and customs brokers, New Zealand Post, domestic retailers, tax advisors and domestic clothing and footwear manufacturers. A government discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system was released in May 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 32 submissions in response to the discussion document. A further 49 submissions to the Tax Working Group that mentioned the GST on low-value imported goods issue were also forwarded to Inland Revenue officials to consider. The submissions received were from private sector tax advisors, goods transporters and customs brokers, New Zealand business groups, electronic marketplaces and a number of private individuals. Most submissions were generally favourable at a high level of the proposed offshore supplier registration system. However, some submissions indicated a preference for a different collection model to the one proposed in the discussion document, or otherwise stated that other collection models should be given further consideration before being discounted. A couple of submissions from tax advisors considered that the proposed offshore supplier registration system may only be an interim step until technological advancements make an alternative collection model feasible. The New Zealand retail industry groups that made submissions on the discussion document agreed with the analysis of the problem presented in the discussion document and were strongly in favour of the proposed solution. New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers were also broadly supportive of the proposed approach but expressed some concerns about the finer details of how the system would be implemented, particularly in relation to the lack of detail provided in the discussion document as to how the proposals would interact with customs processes at the border and any potential changes to these processes. Most private individuals (the bulk of whom submitted to the TWG rather than on the discussion document) supported the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. However, as most of these submissions were made to the TWG prior to the release of the discussion document, these submissions tended not to comment on any specific details of the proposals, such as the proposed collection model. A small number of submissions (including those on the discussion document and to the TWG) from private individuals were opposed to the collection of GST on low-value imported goods regardless of the collection model. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. Impact Statement Template | 15 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options analysed in section 5 consist of the following packages of key design options: • Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (with some gap-filling design options added in for where the discussion document was silent on a specific design detail). • Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400. • Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (status quo option) In April 2018, Cabinet decided to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 and to release a government discussion document to consult on the design details of the proposed system (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). This option reflects the package of design features that were proposed in the government discussion document released for public consultation in May 2018. Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would only apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $400 or less. 8 Goods would be covered by the proposed regime where either the actual supplier of the goods (or the supplier for GST purposes if not the same person) arranges, assists or facilitates the delivery of the goods to a New Zealand address. 9 Supplies to GST-registered businesses would be excluded from the scope of the rules. Rules for determining whether the supply is made to a consumer or to a GST-registered business would apply. However, where GST is charged on a supply to a GST-registered business, the supplier would be allowed to issue the recipient with a tax invoice (thus allowing the GST- registered recipient to claim a deduction for the GST in its GST return), provided that the value of the supply does not exceed $1,000 – otherwise the supplier would be required to 8 The calculation of the customs value is set out in Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. In the case of low-value imported goods, the customs value would generally be the transaction value of the goods (being the price paid or payable when they are sold for export to New Zealand), subject to a number of adjustments including deductions for the costs of transportation, insurance and other charges and expenses related to the handling and transportation of the goods from the time they have left the country of export. For the purposes of determining whether GST applies at the point of sale, a supplier would be able to self- assess the customs value using a reasonable estimate as at the time of supply, rather than being required to determine it strictly in accordance with schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act. 9 The discussion document was silent on whether or not this $400 threshold would be based on the customs value or the freight and insurance-inclusive value of the goods. Basing the threshold on the customs value of the goods has been chosen on the basis of feedback received in submissions. Impact Statement Template | 16 provide a refund of the GST. Non-resident suppliers would be required to register for GST and collect and return GST on goods that have a customs value of $400 or less if their taxable supplies of goods and services exceed (or are expected to exceed) $60,000 in a given 12-month period. However, where low-value goods are sold through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier of the goods for GST purposes and would therefore have the responsibility for registering and returning GST. Suppliers that only sell through GST-registered electronic marketplaces (or who make less than $60,000 in taxable supplies outside of a GST-registered electronic marketplace) would not be required to register. A re-deliverer would only be deemed to be the supplier of low-value goods imported by a consumer if neither the supplier nor an operator of an electronic marketplace assists in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $400 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $400. Double taxation (where both the supplier and Customs collect GST) may arise when multiple low-value goods are sent in a single consignment valued above $400, or if low-value goods are sent in a consignment with goods valued above $400. Double taxation could also arise where the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply differed from that used by Customs at the time of importation. The supplier would be required to issue a receipt to a New Zealand consumer in relation to a supply of low-value imported goods. The receipt would be required to include the name and GST registration number of the supplier, the date of issue and a description of the goods supplied. If GST has been charged on all of the goods, the receipt should show the amount paid for the supply along with a statement that this includes GST, or alternatively, the receipt could identify the GST charged for each of the goods separately. If GST has been charged on only some of the goods (for instance if some are valued above $400), the receipt should include information showing whether GST has been charged on each of the goods. Monetary amounts detailed on the receipt would not need to be in New Zealand dollars. To prevent Customs from collecting GST on the importation of the goods, the consumer would provide their receipt to Customs when asked by Customs to pay the GST. Where double taxation does arise, the supplier would be responsible for providing the consumer with a refund of the GST. 10 Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST 10 The discussion document was silent on who would provide a refund. Placing the responsibility for providing refunds on the supplier is included as one of the design options here as it is officials’ preferred option in relation to who is responsible for providing refunds. Impact Statement Template | 17 Operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers need to use information from either underlying suppliers or consumers to determine the GST treatment of supplies. A marketplace operator would need to have information about the residency of an underlying supplier, as the proposed marketplace rules only apply to supplies made by non-resident underlying suppliers. Re-deliverers would rely on information provided by consumers about the value of the goods. Marketplace operators and re-deliverers would still be liable for GST and any associated interest or penalties in situations where the supplier or consumer provides incorrect or misleading information which results in a GST shortfall. Operators of electronic marketplaces would also be liable for GST on goods sold by non- resident suppliers through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers in situations where: • The payment for the goods is made directly to the supplier instead of to the marketplace operator, or when there is not a split payment mechanism allowing the amount of the GST to be remitted by the payment processor to the marketplace operator; and • The supplier defaults on paying the amount of the GST to the marketplace operator. Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Scope of the rules and registration requirements With the exception of two additions, the design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules are the same as those described under option one. To reduce compliance costs for some suppliers (including re-deliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces), these businesses would be able to charge GST on goods valued above $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers if: • The supplier (or deemed supplier) self-assesses that their total sales of goods individually valued above $400 are no more than 5 percent of the value of their total supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers; or • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to allow a supplier not meeting the above 5 percent test to charge GST on goods valued above $400. 11 To reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses, suppliers would also be able to agree with the Commissioner on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is made to a GST- registered person. This could apply in situations where the nature of the supply or the total value of the supply is such that it would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered business. For example, if the supply is of a large number of low-value imported goods (for 11 The proposed discretion could cover circumstances where the 5 percent test is not met due to a minor or one- off discrepancy, where it is too difficult for the supplier to determine precisely whether or not their supplies of goods above the threshold to consumers are less than 5 percent of their total sales of goods to consumers (but it is likely to be the case that they would be less than 5 percent) and the Commissioner is satisfied that the supplier represents a low compliance risk. Impact Statement Template | 18 instance, hundreds of t-shirts or hundreds of hard copies of a book), either the nature or the value of the supply (or both) would likely indicate that the customer is not a consumer. The design features relating to registration requirements are the same as in option one. Interaction with border collection system Aside from one addition relating to the prevention of double taxation, the design features for how the proposed offshore supplier registration system would interact with the existing border collection system are the same as those described under option one. The supplier would be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents. 12 The supplier could do this by providing the fast freight carrier with a copy of the receipt described under option one, or by instructing the person that undertakes the fulfilment of the goods to do so. If the value of the consignment is above the low-value goods threshold, the fast freight carrier or customs broker would include the supplier’s GST registration number and information about which goods had GST collected by the supplier on the Customs documentation. If this information is included on Customs documents then Customs will only collect GST on the items in the consignment on which GST was not collected at the point of sale. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The Commissioner would be provided with the ability to prescribe or agree to a method for a marketplace operator or a re-deliverer to make conclusions relevant to whether they are the deemed supplier of low-value goods and the amount of GST that is payable. When exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would take into account the commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator and the reliability of this information, the compliance costs of the marketplace operator and the mechanisms the marketplace operator has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. Where the marketplace operator or re-deliverer has a safe harbour agreement, they would not be liable for additional GST if they have relied on incorrect information and as a result have underpaid GST. If this happens, the underlying supplier or consumer may be required to register and pay the GST instead. Operators of electronic marketplaces would be able to claim a bad debt deduction in circumstances where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator, provided the marketplace’s commission or facilitation fee was also not collected. Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 (Ministers’ proposed option) Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would generally apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $1,000 or less. With the exception of the change in 12 At present this would only be feasible where goods are being delivered by fast freight, as there is currently insufficient electronic data on parcels sent through the international postal system. Hence this would not be a requirement where goods are sent to New Zealand by post. Impact Statement Template | 19 the proposed low-value goods threshold from $400 to $1,000, the other design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules and registration requirements would be the same as those described under option two. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $1,000 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $1,000. The design features for the prevention of double taxation are the same as those under option two, as is the process for GST refunds where double taxation does arise. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The design features for marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST (where the supplier or consumer provided incorrect or misleading information or where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator) are the same as those in option two. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for businesses and consumers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: Administrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as possible. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The preferred option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the forgone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about, without unduly restricting trade and consumer choice or creating new distortions. Counteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. Efficiency of compliance, sustainability and neutrality and fairness and equity are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading off increased administration costs for gains in these three areas. The certainty and simplicity criterion would generally be positively correlated with the efficiency of compliance criterion, in that the more certain and simple the rules are, the lower compliance costs should be. However, there are some instances where increased simplicity and certainty for one group may come at the cost of increased uncertainty or complexity for another group. There may also be instances where having more flexible as opposed to prescriptive rules makes the rules simpler for some parties (and thus reduces their Impact Statement Template | 20 compliance costs) but results in the rules being more complex or less certain for other parties. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No low-value goods threshold An option where offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to charge GST on all supplies of imported goods to New Zealand consumers (with or without GST collection at the border by Customs on consignments above a certain value) was ruled out. This option was discounted because of concerns about the potential revenue risks involved with replacing the existing collection of GST at the border on high-value consignments with collection at the point of sale by offshore suppliers, being that offshore suppliers may not return the GST that they had collected (or had purported to have collected on the customs documentation). Defining the low-value goods threshold with reference to the value of the transaction Defining the low-value goods threshold in terms of the value of the total transaction, as opposed to the value of an individual good, was also ruled out. This is because multiple low- value goods could be sold together in the same transaction with a total value in excess of the low-value goods threshold. Non-taxation would therefore arise where the goods were shipped separately in multiple consignments each valued below the low-value goods threshold, thus creating an avoidance opportunity. Preventing double taxation The discussion document asked for submissions on whether a reasonable belief exception similar to that legislated in Australia may be an appropriate way to avoid double taxation. Under a reasonable belief exception, the supplier would not charge GST on a supply of low- value goods if it had a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together in a single consignment with a total value above the low-value goods threshold. A reasonable belief exception was ultimately ruled out on the basis that it would likely be only very rarely used by suppliers, based on the experience so far in Australia. It may also be potentially quite subjective, which could create difficulties for suppliers pose and potentially pose an integrity risk. Refunds where double taxation arises Options where either Customs or Inland Revenue would be responsible for providing GST refunds to consumers where double taxation arises were considered and ultimately ruled out. This is mostly because having Customs provide refunds would be disproportionately costly and would likely be difficult for consumers (at present the provision of one refund takes two hours of staff time). Given that the instances of double taxation should be rare, having Inland Revenue set up an entirely new process is likely to also be disproportionately costly. It would also not be intuitive for consumers to approach Inland Revenue for a refund (being a party that they had not otherwise had any interaction with in relation to the transaction). Impact Statement Template | 21 It is expected that placing the responsibility for providing refunds on suppliers would provide suppliers with more incentive to take reasonable steps to prevent double taxation. Business-to-business supplies Options where offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST in respect of business-to-business supplies or where suppliers would have the option of charging GST on business-to-business supplies valued above $1,000 were ruled out owing to the revenue risks associated with high-value supplies, which naturally pose a greater fraud risk. 13 Electronic marketplaces A “pure” vendor collection model (where the only persons that would have a liability to register and return GST would be suppliers that have legal title over the goods sold to consumers) was not considered. Officials consider that the level of compliance with a pure vendor collection model would not be likely to be good enough to warrant serious consideration of such a model, as it is expected that a large proportion of revenue would continue to be forgone while also meaning that there would not be a level playing field for suppliers that do comply. A joint and several liability model, similar to the one introduced in the United Kingdom for tackling non-compliance by suppliers selling through online marketplaces, was not given much consideration primarily because it is similar to the rebuttable presumption model described below, and hence there are similar concerns with it in relation to compliance costs, enforcement and administration costs. Consideration was given to two exceptions to the “deemed supplier” approach behind the proposed marketplace rules: • Rebuttable presumption model: The default position would be that the marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier, but this presumption of liability can be rebutted if the marketplace agrees to meet the requirements of a “recognised marketplace”. A recognised marketplace would be required to provide Inland Revenue with information about their underlying suppliers, including their trading names, contact details and the total value of supplies of low-value goods that each of their underlying suppliers is making through the marketplace to New Zealand consumers. A recognised marketplace would also endeavour to ensure that liable suppliers have registered and are returning the GST on supplies made to New Zealand consumers, and would be required to block suppliers that are continuously non-compliant from selling to New Zealand where the marketplace is aware or should be aware of this non-compliance. For low-level compliance with their responsibilities, a recognised marketplace would be subject to warnings, ultimately leading to monetary penalties. For significant or ongoing non-compliance the marketplace would lose its “recognised” status even if, despite its best efforts to ensure compliance from suppliers, the suppliers selling through the marketplace are largely non-compliant. 13 Although the goods covered by the proposals are by definition of a low value, multiple low-value goods may nevertheless be supplied together as a single high-value supply. Impact Statement Template | 22 • Commissioner discretion: The Commissioner would have a discretion to allow a given electronic marketplace to not have the responsibility for registering and returning GST in respect of goods sold through its platform. This discretion would apply where the Commissioner considers the marketplace has a compelling case that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with the deemed supplier requirements. These two options were ultimately ruled out for the following reasons: The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion if exercised) would shift compliance costs to underlying suppliers. Aggregate compliance costs are therefore likely to be higher as a result of there being more collection entities, some of whom may have less sophisticated systems and may not be as well-resourced. The model would rely on ongoing commitment of resources by Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces to continually educate suppliers and enforce compliance. It is questionable that these responsibilities and the information requirements for recognised marketplaces would be less onerous than their obligations under the deemed supplier model. Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces would also need to deal with the risk of underlying suppliers continually creating new identities to avoid GST. If compliance is perceived to be low, this may reduce the willingness of other suppliers to comply. It would be difficult to assess the point at which the recognised marketplace would need to revert to being deemed to be the supplier for GST purposes where there is persistent non- compliance by underlying suppliers. Compliant underlying suppliers may be disrupted by potential deregistration. The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion option) would create uncertainty for electronic marketplaces and underlying suppliers in the lead-up to the implementation date, as it may take a considerable amount of time to reach an agreement with the Commissioner (or for the Commissioner to reach a conclusion as to whether her discretion should be exercised). Given the relatively short lead-in time from the intended legislative enactment date and 1 October 2019, it is desirable that all parties have certainty about their obligations so that they can make adequate preparations to comply. The use of the Commissioner’s discretion would be likely to distort competition between electronic marketplaces. There may also be risks that the Commissioner may be perceived as applying the discretion unfairly where it is available only to some electronic marketplaces, which would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the tax system. It may be difficult for the Commissioner to apply the discretion consistently and assess whether the marketplaces are capable of collecting GST. It may be especially difficult for the Commissioner to respond to assertions that a marketplace may withdraw from the New Zealand market if the discretion is not applied. Many of the prominent electronic marketplaces would already be registered in Australia under their equivalent legislation. In many cases the systems already implemented by these marketplaces for Australia could be extended to comply with New Zealand’s rules, as the rules would be broadly similar. Impact Statement Template | 23 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Option one Status quo (Design options proposed in the government discussion document) Option two Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Option three Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 Certainty and simplicity 0 + The addition of simplifying design details post-consultation should simplify compliance for suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers compared with option one. ++ Suppliers that only sell goods valued at or below $1,000 or who fall into the 5 percent rule as a result of the $1,000 threshold can charge GST on all of their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than being required to distinguish between goods valued below or above the threshold. Greater price transparency for consumers compared with options one and two as GST is charged at the point of sale and tariffs and cost recovery charges are removed from imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Efficiency of compliance 0 + Some compliance cost savings compared with option one. + This option is expected to have the least compliance costs overall compared with the other options owing to the $1,000 threshold. Efficiency of administration 0 + Some administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to preventing double taxation, owing to the requirement for suppliers to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents where goods are delivered by fast freight. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under option one. + Administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to the prevention of double taxation. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under options one and two. Fairness and equity 0 + Reduced compliance costs for suppliers and consumers, including reduced potential for double taxation (since the supplier would be required to provide a refund if double taxation occurs). + More suppliers are likely to be liable to register under this option, increasing the coverage of imported goods that are subject to GST compared with options one and two. Reduced potential for double taxation owing to $1,000 threshold and the proposed mechanisms for preventing double taxation. There is however less fairness for retailers importing consignments valued above $1,000 that are subject to tariffs compared with options one and two (up to $2.6m Impact Statement Template | 24 more in tariffs p.a. would be forgone). Sustainability and neutrality 0 + Estimated GST collections are the same as under option one. However, the reduction in compliance costs for suppliers compared with option one may mean that less suppliers cease to ship to New Zealand or refuse to comply. ++ Estimated to collect $25m less in GST over the forecast period than options one and two. However, this option is considered to be the most sustainable over the longer term, as it is considered that it may result in a better compliance outcome than options one and two whilst minimising the number of suppliers that cease shipping to New Zealand (and therefore may actually result in more GST being collected). Approx. $14.9m p.a. in cost recovery charges for Customs and MPI would be forgone compared with options and two. Any resulting funding shortfall may have to be funded through a changed cost recovery structure or through replacement Crown funding. Overall assessment 0 + This option is an improvement over option one with respect to all of the considerations. ++ Sustainability and neutrality and efficiency of compliance outweigh the other considerations. This option is an improvement over option two with respect to most of the other considerations and is therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred option. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement Template | 25 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue officials consider the preferred option is Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Customs officials prefer Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $400. The reason for Inland Revenue’s preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on the efficiency of compliance criterion (in particular the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and electronic marketplaces, as well as the freight and logistics industry). It is acknowledged that the additional benefits to offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and the freight and logistics industry of the $1,000 threshold compared with a threshold of $400 cannot be valued with certainty, whereas the estimated impacts on the government’s financial position are better understood. There is also uncertainty in predicting possible unintended behavioural changes by consumers (as well as other importers and their agents) as a result of a $1,000 threshold. To mitigate these factors and their associated risks, specific monitoring of implementation and compliance will be established, and a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold will be conducted after three years. Customs’ preference is for a low-value goods threshold of $400 (as in options one and two), as this is estimated to collect $303 million of GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold (option three). The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under option three, and Customs and MPI would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Trade, competition and consumer choice issues Some private submitters expressed concerns that consumers’ access to goods from offshore may be significantly reduced as a consequence of the proposals if they go ahead. These sentiments were echoed by Business NZ and KPMG, who while being broadly supportive of the proposals noted that there is a risk that implementation of the policy will affect consumer choice and trade. Business NZ warned against making the rules overly complicated, noting that a pragmatic and reasonable approach is needed to ensure the impacts on trade, competition and consumer choice are minimal. It was also pointed out there could be reciprocal problems for New Zealand exporters if New Zealand is perceived to be a country to avoid selling to. Private submitters expressing concerns about possible adverse impacts on consumer choice tended to disagree with the analysis of the problem or expressed some reservations about it. In particular, these submitters pointed out that many goods that are being imported by consumers cannot be purchased from New Zealand retailers – or, where they can be purchased domestically, the price difference compared with an overseas supplier tends to be significantly more than 15%. Two submitters expressed Impact Statement Template | 26 particular concern in relation to clothing and shoes in less common sizes that they could not easily source from domestic retailers and stated that they have little other choice than to purchase these goods from overseas suppliers. A submission from an industry group representing three electronic marketplaces stated that the extraterritorial application of GST will create additional costs for overseas businesses which would serve as a barrier to trade. They considered this to be contrary to both New Zealand’s advocacy for free trade and the spirit of various free trade agreements. They stated that the policy risks reciprocation by other governments on New Zealand exporters, which could stifle entrepreneurship and innovation and decrease exports. As discussed below, a number of design features have been incorporated into option 3 (Customs’ preferred option) and option 4 (Inland Revenue’s preferred option) that are designed to minimise compliance costs for suppliers and electronic marketplaces, and as such are intended to minimise the risk of adverse trade and consumer impacts. Electronic marketplaces Under the rules proposed in the discussion document for electronic marketplaces, where a supply of low-value goods is made through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to make the supply for GST purposes. The $60,000 registration threshold would therefore apply to the marketplace operator’s deemed supplies to New Zealand consumers, as well as any other taxable supplies the marketplace operator makes. Where the operator of the electronic marketplace is deemed to be the supplier, whether or not the actual supplier of the goods is above the $60,000 registration threshold is irrelevant for determining whether or not GST applies to the supply. The design and scope of the marketplace rules were commented on in many of the submissions received. A number of submissions noted that business models for marketplaces vary widely and as such, a simple extension of the existing rules for cross- border services and intangibles to marketplaces for goods may not be appropriate. Submissions noted that clarity, simplicity and flexibility would be crucial to ensuring the marketplaces rules are workable. Discussions with stakeholders also indicated that clear and simple rules would be crucial to making the marketplace rules workable. Submissions from electronic marketplaces were strongly opposed to the proposed offshore supplier registration system and in particular the proposed rules for electronic marketplaces. Submissions from electronic marketplaces raised the following objections: • The proposed electronic marketplace rules are onerous for marketplaces to implement and are more complex that the rules requiring operators of electronic marketplaces for services and intangibles to collect GST. • Complying with the rules will result in significant compliance costs for marketplaces and it is unfair for the New Zealand Government to impose these costs on marketplaces. These costs may either be passed on to their suppliers, increasing the risk of these suppliers choosing not to ship to New Zealand, or will at least be Impact Statement Template | 27 partly borne by consumers, therefore imposing additional costs on consumers over and above the amount of the tax. • Marketplaces may not have and may be unable to obtain sufficient information to correctly determine the amount of GST payable. • Marketplaces that do not process transactions between buyers and sellers on their platform may have difficulties in collecting the GST they are liable to remit. • Requiring marketplaces to collect GST on supplies made by third party suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold would place these suppliers at a disadvantage, would be discriminatory, and would lead to market distortions. • Compliant marketplaces will be at risk of third party sellers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold switching to selling through small or non-compliant marketplaces or to selling on their own websites. • Consumers will seek out small or non-compliant marketplaces or suppliers to avoid the tax, giving an unfair competitive advantage to suppliers and marketplaces that are not complying with the rules and disadvantaging the marketplaces and suppliers that would comply. This may result in decreased compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protections and dangerous goods. • Electronic marketplaces that are only caught by the electronic marketplace rules because they set some of the terms and conditions under which offshore sellers make sales on the marketplace would be able to easily structure out of being deemed to be the supplier of the goods by simply ensuring they do not set any of the terms and conditions of sale. This would reduce the level of compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protection and prohibited or dangerous goods. As noted in section 3.3, two exceptions to the deemed supplier approach (a Commissioner discretion and the rebuttable presumption model) were considered but ultimately ruled out. The proposed rules for electronic marketplaces are considered to be crucial to the success of the offshore supplier registration system. Without such rules, it is expected that thousands of suppliers that sell through marketplaces would be required to register for GST, meaning that aggregate compliance costs may be higher, compliance would likely be lower and enforcement more difficult. Narrowing the scope of the proposed rules is also unpalatable as the creation of a new boundary would be likely to create opportunities for electronic marketplaces to structure out of the rules, and may distort competition between electronic marketplaces. While still hypothetically possible, these risks are considered to be less significant under the proposed rules. Given the current market dominance of the most prominent electronic marketplaces, the extent to which having electronic marketplaces collect GST on sales by suppliers below the registration threshold would give a competitive advantage to small or non-compliant marketplaces is not entirely clear. For instance, in an online shopping environment, consumers already have strong incentives to purchase from trusted websites. It is not clear that avoiding GST of 15% on a low-value purchase (which may still Impact Statement Template | 28 be significantly cheaper than a similar item sourced domestically) would provide enough incentive for many consumers to switch to shopping on websites that may not be as well- known or reputable as the larger marketplaces, and therefore which may be less readily trusted by consumers. It is also unclear whether the imposition of GST on what is likely to be only a small proportion of most suppliers’ sales would be a large enough motivator for smaller suppliers to establish their own websites or switch to selling through a marketplace that would likely reach a smaller audience. If these suppliers consider that the revenue from these sales does not justify the costs to them associated with having the marketplace operator charge GST on their sales to New Zealand, a more likely possibility seems to be that these suppliers would simply stop shipping goods to New Zealand, rather than leave the electronic marketplace altogether (at least if they are selling through a global marketplace as opposed to a New Zealand-specific website). However, the extent to which this may eventuate is also unknown, given that the marketplace operator would be fulfilling the bulk of the GST compliance obligations for the supplier (although these compliance costs may be passed on to underlying suppliers). Marketplace operators’ concerns about being provided with incorrect or inadequate information to determine the GST treatment of supplies and any associated liabilities in respect of these supplies should be addressed by the Commissioner discretion to prescribe or agree to a method for determining the GST treatment of supplies. Concerns about bad debts risk for electronic marketplaces that do not actually collect the money from the consumer should also be addressed by the suggested bad debt deduction. Low-value goods threshold Several submitters commented on the $400 threshold that was proposed in the discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system. Most of these submitters expressed a preference for a $1,000 threshold, which was considered to reduce compliance costs for suppliers (since it is closer to Australia’s low- value threshold of AU$1,000 than $400 is), as well as being better for consumers and for the freight and logistics industry. In comparison, only two submitters expressed a strong preference for a $400 threshold. It appears that this preference was based on concerns about a potential fiscal risk in relation to goods valued between $400 and $1,000, on which GST is (or should be) collected at present. Inland Revenue officials consider that the overall compliance costs to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers associated with a $1,000 threshold would be lower than the overall compliance costs to these businesses if a $400 threshold is chosen. Implementing a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would also be more beneficial for New Zealand consumers compared with a $400 threshold. However, Customs has concerns about the potential impacts of a $1,000 threshold on the management of border risk. Impacts on suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers While the vast majority of goods imported by consumers are of a very low value (consumer Impact Statement Template | 29 surveys and Customs import entry data show that the average value is less than $100), a number of e-commerce businesses will also stock goods that may be more expensive, such as certain types of clothing, jewellery, watches and electronics, which some New Zealand consumers may potentially import. The existence of a low-value goods threshold of any value therefore creates additional complexity for suppliers who supply goods both above and below the threshold, as their checkout systems would need to be set up to charge GST on goods individually valued at or below that threshold and not on those valued above that threshold. Also, because the threshold is defined in New Zealand dollars, the supplier’s systems would also need to perform a currency conversion where the prices of the goods on their website are expressed in a foreign currency for the purposes of determining whether a given good is above or below the low-value goods threshold. By increasing the proposed $400 low-value goods threshold to $1,000, the number of suppliers that may sell goods both above and below the threshold would be reduced. This would decrease the number of suppliers that would need to implement systems to differentiate between high and low-value goods and have differing GST treatments for high and low-value goods (since if they do not stock any goods valued above the threshold they will not need to distinguish and can simply add GST to all of their sales to New Zealand consumers without requiring complex foreign exchange conversions at the time of sale). As Australia has a low-value threshold of AU$1,000 under their equivalent rules, there would be some suppliers that are already registered in Australia that only supply goods below Australia’s threshold. At present, these suppliers do not need to build systems to distinguish between low and high-value goods, as these suppliers can simply add GST to all of their supplies made to Australian consumers. However, some of these suppliers would sell goods both above and below $400 – therefore if New Zealand sets a $400 low- value goods threshold these suppliers would need to build additional systems to those already implemented for Australia in order to comply. This may be much less of an issue with a higher threshold that is much closer to Australia’s threshold, such as $1,000. Impacts on consumers Some submissions from consumers expressed support for removing cost recovery charges collected on consignments valued above the current de minimis. Increasing the proposed low-value goods threshold to $1,000 would see the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs from most goods imported by consumers. This would mean that consumers importing goods between $400 and $1,000 would actually pay less overall for these goods than they do at present. This would also ensure the overwhelming majority of consumers are no longer surprised or inconvenienced by having to pay additional GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges. Further, Customs would continue to collect cost recovery charges on consignments of goods that have had GST is collected at the point of sale by the supplier where the total consignment is valued above the threshold. A $400 threshold may mean there would be more instances of consumers having to pay these cost recovery charges where they might have expected that they would not have to (as they had already paid GST). Having offshore suppliers collect GST on a broader range of goods (in terms of value) would also provide greater price transparency for consumers, as offshore websites may be more likely to display a GST-inclusive price for all of their goods at the time of purchase. Impact Statement Template | 30 This would provide a fairer price comparison with New Zealand retailers who generally display GST-inclusive prices. A $1,000 threshold is also expected to be less distortionary than a $400 threshold. Anecdotally, many consumers at present limit their online purchases to a maximum of $400 to avoid having their goods stopped at the border. A $1,000 threshold may mean that less consumers would limit their spending to avoid having goods stopped at the border or to avoid the collection of duties and cost recovery charges. On the other hand, a $1,000 threshold may increase consumers’ incentives to seek out and purchase from unregistered suppliers or to have items purchased and sent to New Zealand by friends and family overseas. Double taxation While the inclusion of the 5 percent rule in option two would be expected to help to reduce compliance costs for a number of suppliers associated with differentiating between low- value and high-value goods, one issue with combining this design option with a threshold of $400 is that it would be likely to further increase the incidence of double taxation. Increasing the proposed threshold to $1,000 however would greatly reduce the potential for double taxation to occur as much fewer consignments valued over $1,000 are imported by consumers, compared with the number of consignments valued over $400. Based on 2017/18 transactional banking data showing goods purchases by New Zealand consumers from offshore suppliers, there were 230,398 transactions between $400 and $1,000 and only 56,671 transactions between $1,000 and $2,000. Furthermore, the vast majority of consignments valued above $1,000 would be imported by GST-registered businesses and would not be subject to the proposed rules. Border and biosecurity risks Importers are incentivised by Customs’ penalty regime to ensure that accurate imported entry information is provided in relation to imported consignments on which revenue is collectable. The penalties for providing inaccurate information for consignments on which no revenue is assessable are however smaller, and therefore provide less incentive for importers to ensure the accuracy of this information; consequently, the quality of information provided in relation to these consignments tends to be poorer. Customs and MPI consider that setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may therefore reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments under $1,000. As well as potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management, poor quality information may also impact on the efficiency of border processes. Customs considers that non-compliance in the valuation of goods to evade duty will continue to exist under a $1,000 threshold. This may also increase costs to both agencies and slow down the clearance of goods at the border. Customs has a range of sanctions to encourage the provision of accurate information and will continue to work with customs brokers, fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post, but it will remain a challenge for both agencies to manage risks. Impact Statement Template | 31 Impacts on goods transporters and customs brokers Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may be beneficial for fast freight carriers, customs brokers and New Zealand Post, with fewer goods stopped at the border for revenue collection. This would reduce the costs that New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers currently incur in transporting consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. New Zealand Post noted in their submission that they currently incur a significant compliance cost burden in facilitating the collection of GST (and other charges) and holding goods in storage on behalf of Customs. New Zealand Post considered that having a $1,000 threshold would therefore reduce their compliance costs. It is also noted that the effects of inflation and the expected continuation of the rapid growth in import volumes experienced over the last few years (and in particular the growth in the volume of low-value goods imported by post) will further exacerbate the existing pressures on border processing of low-value imported goods over time, which may mean that maintaining a low-value goods threshold of $400 may not be cost-effective in the medium term (at least not for New Zealand Post). GST revenue A risk with having a $1,000 threshold is that it may put at risk the GST currently collected by the Crown on imported goods valued between $400 and $1,000. In 2017/18 approximately $4.26 million of GST was collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers valued under $400, and $22.40 million was collected on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. 14 While a $1,000 threshold does put more currently collected GST at risk, Inland Revenue considers that most of this currently collected GST would continue to be collected under option three. A $1,000 threshold may even have some benefits for GST revenue collection including: • increasing the number of suppliers with a liability to register by increasing offshore suppliers’ level of taxable supplies (as supplies of goods valued between $400 and $1,000 would also be taxable supplies); • reducing the risk of GST not being collected on goods between $400 and $1,000 owing to undervaluation as, even if the supplier undervalued the goods, when the goods are supplied through a marketplace the marketplace will still collect the correct amount of GST; and • reducing the reliance on New Zealand Post to identify when goods sent by post are above the de minimis. 14 W e have assumed that 30% of consignments between the de minimis and $400 and 44% of imported consignments between $400 and $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses. These estimates of the business share of imported goods are derived from Australian data, as we do not have any New Zealand data on this. It is possible that the business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 is higher in New Zealand owing to New Zealand’s lower de minimis (likely resulting in fewer consumers importing consignments above $400). If New Zealand has a higher business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 then the net amount of GST collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers would be lower. Impact Statement Template | 32 Customs’ and MPI’s cost recovery charges Setting the low-value goods threshold at $400 would result in a reduction in Customs’ and MPI’s cost-recovered funding of $2.92 million per year based on the amount collected in 2017/18. Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 would result in Customs and MPI forgoing more cost-recovered funding. In 2017/18 $17.795 million (GST exclusive) was collected through Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee ($10.736 million) and MPI’s Biosecurity System Entry Levy ($7.059 million) on consignments below $1,000. A low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would therefore require a greater amount of Crown funding to replace the additional cost- recovered funding forgone. Customs’ and MPI’s costs of processing goods are also expected to increase due to expected volume growth and ongoing resource impacts. Therefore, regardless of what threshold is chosen, or even if no action is taken, Crown funding for Customs and MPI is likely to need to be increased over time in response to increasing import volumes. Tariff revenue Changing from the current de minimis of $60 duty owing to either a $400 or $1,000 low- value goods threshold will result in the loss of tariff revenue collected between the current de minimis and the low-value goods threshold. In 2017/18 $0.58 million was collected in tariffs on consignments between the current de minimis and $400 and $3.23 million was collected in tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. These tariffs are mainly collected on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries. MFAT does not consider that the loss of $0.58 million in tariffs from having a $400 threshold or of $3.23 million from there being a $1,000 threshold would significantly diminish the value of New Zealand’s remaining tariffs as negotiating coin in current and future Free Trade Agreements. MBIE, the agency responsible for tariff policy, also does not consider the revenue collected from these tariffs to be significant and supports the removal of tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. If the low-value goods threshold is set at $1,000, the loss of tariff revenue on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000 may potentially be seen as unfair to New Zealand retailers. A retailer that imports a consignment valued above $1,000 containing goods subject to tariffs will need to pay these tariffs to Customs. The tariffs paid by these businesses would ultimately be passed on to their customers. In contrast, if a consumer buys one of those goods directly from an offshore supplier they will not have to pay any tariffs if the good is shipped in a consignment valued at or below $1,000. Compared with setting the low-value goods threshold at $400, setting it at $1,000 does therefore further undermine the principle that taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation, but only in relation to a small subset of transactions. This is not considered to be likely to be significant in its impact as New Zealand has few remaining tariffs (mainly on clothing and footwear) and our free trade agreements have eliminated these tariffs for many countries including China, Australia and the 10 ASEAN countries. If no action is taken, the amount collected from tariffs is likely to continue to reduce over time as a result of current and future free Impact Statement Template | 33 trade agreements. On balance Inland Revenue considers that this concern is outweighed by the efficiency benefits of setting the threshold at $1,000 and relinquishing tariff duty on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. New Zealand businesses importing low-value goods would also benefit from the removal of tariffs (and cost recovery charges) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. Net revenue impact Table 1 below shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period under options one and two. Table 2 shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period under option three. Table 1: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $400 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 73.000 109.000 121.000 303.000 Cost recovery charges (2.190) (2.920) (2.920) (8.030) GST net of cost recovery charges 70.810 106.080 118.080 294.970 Table 2: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $1,000 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 66.000 100.000 112.000 278.000 Cost recovery charges (13.346) (17.795) (17.795) (48.936) GST net of cost recovery charges 52.654 82.205 94.205 229.064 The estimates in the above tables do not account for any change in forgone cost- recovered funding over time. As noted earlier, the amount of additional Crown funding Customs and MPI would require under either low-value goods threshold option, or if no further action is taken, is likely to increase over time owing to growing import volumes. The tables above also do not account for any tariff revenue forgone under options one, two and three. This is because tariff revenue is decreasing over time owing to the phased implementation of New Zealand’s current and future free trade agreements, resulting in an annual reduction in the amount of goods that are subject to tariffs. In the 2017/18 year the amount collected in tariffs on consignments under $400 was $0.58 million and the amount collected under $1,000 was $3.23 million. Impact Statement Template | 34 Proposed exclusion for business-to-business supplies Under the proposed rules, only supplies of low-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers would be subject to GST. Supplies of low-value imported goods to GST- registered businesses would not be subject to GST. The rationale for excluding business- to-business supplies from the rules is to prevent a revenue risk arising from a resident business claiming a GST deduction for GST charged to them by an offshore supplier, but the offshore supplier not returning this GST to Inland Revenue. Three submissions proposed allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods. Submitters noted that identifying a customer as a GST-registered business can be difficult for suppliers to do, and that compliance costs arise for both the offshore supplier and the New Zealand business when GST is incorrectly charged. Furthermore, some submitters noted that the revenue risk from allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods may be relatively low. CA ANZ however was supportive of the proposed exclusion of business-to-business supplies. They noted that the exclusion of business-to-business supplies would mean some suppliers are outside the regime entirely because they only supply to businesses, which they agreed is desirable. They also considered that the exclusion would provide GST-registered recipients with an incentive to notify the supplier of their GST-registered status, which they considered would likely be easier than obtaining a valid tax invoice from the supplier. As noted in section 3.3, allowing offshore suppliers to charge GST on high-value business- to-business supplies was ruled out due to the fiscal risks involved. However, officials consider that the proposed design options under options two and three (of allowing offshore suppliers to issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies of low- value imported goods where the value of such a supply does not exceed $1,000, and allowing suppliers to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is to a GST-registered persons) should help to reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses. Allowing suppliers to charge GST and issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies valued at or below $1,000 may mean that suppliers would be rarely required to distinguish in practice. Compliance and enforcement A number of submitters were concerned whether the proposed rules could be effectively enforced. The submission from the electronic marketplace industry group suggested that the proposed system would result in only 25 percent of the currently forgone GST being collected, based on the Australian Treasury’s forecasted collection rate for the first year of the Australian legislation. Several submitters stated that where suppliers refuse to comply, it will be difficult and costly for Inland Revenue to enforce compliance from these suppliers. Concern was also raised in some submissions that offshore suppliers would avoid collecting GST by splitting their business into multiple entities in order to get below the $60,000 registration threshold. Impact Statement Template | 35 Based on the available evidence, officials consider that a relatively small number of suppliers and electronic marketplaces are likely to account for the majority of low-value goods imported by consumers. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine shows that 10 entities account for approximately 25 percent of the amount that consumers spent in 2017/18 on goods valued below $400 from offshore suppliers. Recent research by the International Post Corporation suggests that the five biggest electronic marketplaces account for around 50 percent of goods imported into New Zealand. On this basis, officials consider it is not unreasonable to assume that 75 percent of the GST that would be returned if all liable entities registered and complied will actually be collected (which is the assumption that was used in coming up with the revenue estimates). Application date A number of submissions discussed the proposed implementation date of 1 October 2019. Retail NZ and Booksellers NZ both expressed support for the earliest possible implementation date. In contrast, Alibaba, eBay and Etsy recommended that New Zealand should align our timeline with the European Union (EU), who will be extending their existing registration system for cross-border services to low-value goods imported from non-EU countries from January 2021. Business NZ recommended that the implementation date should be delayed if there are ongoing and persistent concerns over offshore suppliers blocking New Zealand buyers. A number of other submissions did not directly comment on the implementation date, but noted that a sufficient period of time would be needed for the necessary changes to be made by marketplaces, suppliers and others. Amazon in particular submitted that there would need to be a lead time of 18-24 months to allow for businesses to implement changes to systems and processes. Deloitte also recommended that the implementation date be reviewed with marketplaces and suppliers to ensure they have sufficient time to make the required changes. Officials still consider a 1 October 2019 implementation date to be feasible. However, any delays to the introduction or passing of legislation, or major changes to the legislation between introduction and the Royal assent would necessitate reconsideration of the implementation date. To give suppliers sufficient time to make any necessary systems changes and register, officials recommend that suppliers be given the option of having a six month taxable period for the first six months of the rules. This would mean that they would not be required to file their first GST return and pay the associated tax liability until 7 May 2020, essentially giving suppliers a three-month extension of time to register. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The costs to offshore suppliers would include registering for GST Potentially high upfront systems and Low Impact Statement Template | 36 15 Monetised costs and benefits in this table have not been discounted, since for revenue measures the undiscounted figures (as opposed to net present value figures) make more intuitive sense and are the figures that are included in Budget estimates.

Regulators The implementation costs to Inland Revenue are estimated to be up to $460,000, with ongoing administration costs estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low-value goods and other minor systems changes. It also allows for an increase in the volume of work for staff currently processing registrations. Loss of funding from cost recovery charges to Customs and MPI. Up to $0.7m over the forecast period (not discounted) 15 . Approximately $17.8m/yr in cost recovery charges (based on the 2017/18 year, not discounted) but likely to increase in coming years with increasing volumes of imported goods. $48.9m over the forecast period (not discounted), assuming the amount of cost recovery charges collected each year would remain the same if no action is taken.

Other impacts: GST would be collected on goods from offshore suppliers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold where the sale is made through a GST-registered electronic marketplace. From a revenue standpoint, this may be seen as an advantage, as it is expected that a significant amount of revenue would be collected on sales by offshore suppliers below the registration threshold though electronic marketplaces. Given the rationale of having a registration threshold is to balance compliance and administration costs against the revenue that would be generated if the supplier registered for GST, collecting GST on these supplies may be justified on the basis that the rationale behind the registration threshold is not as relevant, given that the marketplace operator would bear the bulk of the compliance costs. However, this may give rise to concerns about competitive disadvantages for marketplace operators and smaller offshore businesses selling through these marketplaces. Potential risks and uncertainties: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non- resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to offer shipping of goods to New Zealand. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 16 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 16 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Impact Statement Template | 40 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments are currently being drafted and will be included in an upcoming tax bill. The proposal will also require amendments to some Customs regulations. These regulations will be updated by Order in Council. Both Inland Revenue and Customs will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue and Customs have not identified any concerns with their ability to implement the proposals in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’. The proposed changes are due to come into effect from 1 October 2019. Inland Revenue and Customs are confident that the proposals can be implemented within the proposed timeline. Inland Revenue has estimated that the one-off costs to implement these proposals will be up to $460,000. Inland Revenue’s on going administration costs are estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. Inland Revenue will self-fund the costs associated with the initiative. Customs expects the costs of systems changes for implementation at 1 October 2019 will be minimal in the short term. These costs will be met within existing baselines. Some offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers have expressed concern that a 1 October 2019 enactment date may not give them enough time to implement the necessary systems changes to comply. However, many of these stakeholders would have had 15 months of experience complying with Australia’s substantially similar rules and as such the systems changes required may not be substantial. It is also noted that the length of time between bill introduction and the application date for the GST on cross-border services and intangibles changes was similar to that now proposed for low-value imported goods. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The primary issue concerning implementation that has been raised through consultation is whether a 1 October 2019 application date gives offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers enough time to make the necessary systems changes in order to comply. To mitigate this risk the proposed changes will be made as simple as possible for these stakeholders. Furthermore, the proposed optional six month filing period for the first six months of the new rules would give these stakeholders an extra three months to update their systems before they need to file their first GST return. Another implementation risk is that offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers may not be aware of the new rules. To address this risk Inland Revenue will need to identify and communicate the legislative change to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers who might be required to register in New Zealand. A targeted marketing campaign would be needed to reach all the affected offshore suppliers and aid with compliance. Impact Statement Template | 41 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and MPI will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. Officials will monitor the extent to which offshore businesses no longer ship goods to New Zealand by keeping a close watch over articles in the media. Talking with private sector advisors and re-deliverers may also provide some indication of the extent to which this occurs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Officials from Inland Revenue and Customs will undertake a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold three years after the new rules are implemented. Officials will also continue to monitor the future viability of other collection models to see if the practical issues with these models can be overcome. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme.
Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 1 Coversheet: Ring-fencing rental losses Advising agencies The Treasury and Inland Revenue Decision sought Agreement to key design features of a rental loss ring-fencing policy Proposing Ministers Hon Grant Robertson (Minister of Finance) and Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government’s stated objective for ring-fencing rental losses is to reduce unfairness by levelling the playing field between property speculators/investors and owner-occupiers. Currently, investors can have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on their other income sources, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Ring-fencing rental losses reduces the tax benefits enjoyed by property investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: • First-home buyers. Ring-fencing of rental losses could help improve first home buyers’ ability to compete with investors, improving housing affordability for home buyers, and potentially increasing the share of New Zealanders who own their own homes; and • Government. Ring-fencing of rental losses is expected to increase tax revenue by approximately $190 million per annum. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 2 Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Investors. Residential property investors who negatively gear could face higher tax liabilities on an ongoing basis, if they persistently make a loss. It could be the case that investors start experiencing positive rental cash flows after a period. Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 40 percent of taxpayers with rentals record rental losses at any given time, with an average estimated annual tax benefit of $2,000; and • Renters. Rental loss ring-fencing will reduce after tax rental returns for some landlords. This could encourage the transfer of housing stock from investment housing (ie, rental housing) to owner-occupier housing, putting pressure on the remaining rental stock. On average, owner-occupied housing tends to have fewer people per house. This suggests that the transfer of housing stock from rental to owner-occupied may reduce the amount of housing available for each remaining renter unless there is an adequate flow of new housing onto the rental market. This may lead to increased rents. Landlords may also pass on their rental losses to tenants in the form of increased rents. There are other ways that this and other policies could impact the rental market, and officials note that there is significant uncertainty about the net impact. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Uncertainty around the impact on the housing market. The Government is closely monitoring the performance of the housing market. However, given the number of other policy and regulatory changes to the housing market, it may not be possible to isolate the impact of this proposal on the housing market. • Implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Changes will be required to START (Inland Revenue’s tax processing computer system). A detailed assessment of required changes and an execution plan is being made as part of returns planning for the 2019- 20 income year. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Evidence supporting housing market impact analysis is limited, and suggests significant uncertainty as to the net impacts of the policy, especially on the rental market. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 3 Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using Inland Revenue data on negatively- geared rental properties. Significant simplifying assumptions have been made, on which the fiscal estimates are conditional. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Ring-fencing rental losses RIA prepared by the Treasury and Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIA describes how ring-fencing rental losses will meet the stated objective and also provides excellent coverage of the main uncertainties and risks around its likely impact. The analysis summarised in the RIA is as good as could be expected in light of the constrained range of options considered and the uncertainties over the net impacts of loss ring-fencing on the housing market. Even so, the analysis only partially meets the quality assurance criteria primarily because it is not possible to be confident that the stated objective is being met in the best way and with the least unintended consequences. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 4 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses Section 1: General information Purpose 1.1.1 The Treasury and Inland Revenue are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis 1.1.2 The key limitations and constraints applying to this analysis are as follows: a) Constrained range of options considered: The Government has already announced its intention to introduce ring-fencing of rental losses. Options considered are therefore focussed on key design settings for that policy, rather than consideration of alternatives to loss ring-fencing. b) Time constraints: Ministers have decided to plan for the introduction of loss ring- fencing rules for the 2019-20 tax year. With that commencement date in mind, the proposals are required to be included in legislation introduced before the start of the 2019-20 income year to give taxpayers a degree of certainty about how the rules will operate. c) Lack of empirical data: The analysis on the impact of this policy on the housing market is constrained by a lack of empirical data. There are few recent examples of countries implementing loss ring-fencing rules. In cases where such rules have been introduced (for example, in Australia in the 1980s), it has been difficult to tease out the effects of loss ring-fencing rules on observed changes in the housing market. When empirical evidence is not available, a theoretical assessment of the expected impact has been provided. d) Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: Ring-fencing of rental losses is estimated to increase tax revenue by approximately $190m per annum once fully implemented. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast is that it assumes static behaviour. A change towards greater equity investment in rental housing, or a change away from investment in residential rental properties altogether, could displace revenue from other taxable investments. This impact is not captured in the revenue forecast. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 5 Responsible Manager: Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy & Strategy Inland Revenue 1 August 2018 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? 2.1.1 First home buyers account for 22% of home purchases in New Zealand, compared with 39% for multiple property owners. This may suggest that first home buyers can struggle to compete against investors and existing owner-occupiers in the market. Home ownership rates have now fallen to 63% - down from 74% in 1991. 1 Source: CoreLogic NZ 2.1.2 Speculative capital gain is a likely driver for investor activity in the residential housing market. The average return on rental property excluding capital gains is low – the average gross rental yield on a three-bedroom Auckland property is 3% per annum. 2 This suggests investors are buying property in anticipation of capital gain. Other possible drivers for investor activity include the prospect of future increases in rents, or because it is perceived as safer than other types of investments. 2.1.3 Falling rates of home ownership, untaxed capital gains, and increasing house prices contribute to equity concerns around housing, and there is strong interest in measures to improve housing affordability, especially for first home buyers. 2.1.4 In this context, negative gearing has come under scrutiny. Negative gearing involves investors reducing their taxable income with rental losses. The practice is relatively widespread in the New Zealand rental market – 40% of taxpayers with residential investment property report rental losses, with an average tax benefit of $2,000 per annum. 1 https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/dwelling-and-household-estimates-dec ember-2017-quarter 2 https://www.barfoot.co.nz/market-reports/2017/december/changes-in-gross-yield Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 7 2.1.5 We expect the practice of negative gearing of rental properties to continue if no further action is taken. The magnitude of losses being claimed is likely to be dependent on changes in the housing market (for example, increases in rents will tend to reduce rental losses, all other things being equal), and interest rates. 2.1.6 Many overseas countries have some form of loss ring-fencing of residential property, including the United Kingdom and the United States. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? 2.2.1 Investment housing is currently taxed under the same rules that generally apply to other investments. This means that rents are income, and interest and other expenses (other than capital improvements) are deductible. Any capital gain realised on sale of the property is not taxed unless the property is held on revenue account. Revenue account land holders are predominantly dealers, developers, and people who acquire properties for resale (though there are a number of other rules that may mean a property is on revenue account, including the bright-line test, which taxes sales of residential properties within a defined time period). Most rental property investors hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain. 2.2.2 Currently, investors (including those who hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain) can use losses from the rental properties to offset their income from other sources, thus reducing their income tax liability. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? 2.3.1 The policy problem is that there is an uneven playing field between property investors who are buying property in anticipation of capital gain, and owner-occupiers. Currently, investors can have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on other sources of income, helping them to outbid owner- occupiers (whose mortgages are not tax-deductible) for properties. 2.3.2 Rental housing is not formally tax favoured. However, there is an argument that it may be under-taxed compared to other asset classes given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. The fact that rental property investors often make persistent tax losses is a possible indication that expected capital gains are an important motivation for many investors purchasing rental property. While interest and other expenses are fully deductible, in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax, not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. There is therefore an argument that, to the extent deductible expenses in the long-term exceed income from rents, those expenses in fact relate to the capital gain, so should not be deductible unless the capital gain is taxed. It is reasonable to suppose that there is a widespread perception of unfairness, especially in the context of falling rates of home ownership, untaxed capital gains, and increasing house prices (see above in section 2.1). Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 8 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? 2.4.1 The Government has committed to implementing loss ring-fencing. Officials have therefore only considered options as to different broad approaches to ring-fencing, and have not considered alternatives to loss ring-fencing. 2.4.2 The Government has also established the Tax Working Group (the TWG) to look at the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The TWG’s Terms of Reference include a requirement that particular consideration be given to “\[w\]hether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system.” 3 Because consideration of a capital gains tax is within the purview of the TWG, it is not considered here as a possible option for addressing the issue that underlies the concern about investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain having an unfair advantage over owner-occupiers – which is that not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. If a comprehensive capital gains tax were to be implemented, there could be a case for reconsidering whether rental loss ring-fencing is necessary. We note that the Government has stated that any significant changes legislated for from the TWG’s final report will not come into force until the 2021 tax year. 4 2.4.3 There are a range of Government policies and initiatives concerning housing. Supply-side initiatives include KiwiBuild, Special Housing Areas, and infrastructure financing and funding efforts. Demand side initiatives include extension of the bright- line test, restrictions on foreign buyers, and the Reserve Bank’s loan-to-value ratio loan restrictions. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? 2.5.1 Prior to releasing an officials’ issues paper for consultation, officials had initial discussions on the proposal with a number of key private sector advisors, including tax professionals and the New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation. Those discussions were aimed at gathering private sector views on key design issues and potential implementation and compliance concerns. 2.5.2 An officials’ issues paper Rental loss ring-fencing was released in March 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 106 submissions in response to this issues paper. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. 3 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/terms-of-reference/ 4 https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/towards-f airer-tax-s ys tem-tax-working-group-terms-ref erenc e-announced Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 9 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? 3.1.1 Our options analysis looks at the following packages of key design options for the proposed loss ring-fencing rules: Option 1: Status quo. Option 2: Design options proposed in the officials’ issues paper. Option 3: Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper. 3.1.2 The options considered in relation to each of the above key design issues are as follows: (all options are mutually exclusive) Option 1: Status quo 3.1.3 There are no rules which ring-fence rental losses, therefore any losses incurred on a rental property can be offset against the taxpayer’s other income. Option 2: Design options proposed in the officials’ issues paper 3.1.4 This option reflects the package of design features which were proposed in the officials’ issues paper released for public consultation in March 2018. Land within the scope of the proposed rules 3.1.5 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules are to apply to residential land. There is already a definition of “residential land” in the Income Tax Act 2007, and the loss ring-fencing rules would apply to land within that definition. Using the definition already in the legislation would avoid the additional complexity of having different definitions for different rules. The options for what property the rules should apply to are around what residential land should be excluded from the scope of the rules. 3.1.6 The rules are not proposed to apply to residential land that is the taxpayer’s main home, or residential land that is subject to the mixed-use asset rules. 3.1.7 The rules will not apply to residential land that is on revenue account because the taxpayer acquires the property for the purpose of a land-related business. 5 3.1.8 Finally, the rules will apply to residential land that is owned by all persons, including companies and trusts. Level at which the loss ring-fencing rules should apply (ie, at the individual property level or across a portfolio) 3.1.9 Losses are ring-fenced within a portfolio of residential property. If a taxpayer has a 5 And in the case of a business of erecting buildings, the taxpayer or an associated person made improvements to the land. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 10 portfolio of residential investment properties, losses from one property can be used to offset profits from another property within the portfolio. Whether ring-fenced losses should be released on the sale of a residential property 3.1.10 Ring-fenced losses are able to be used on a sale of residential land that gives rise to taxable income; to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced. What rules should be put in place to minimise opportunities to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules 3.1.11 This option would include specific rules to address a structuring opportunity to get around the new rules. These concern interest allocation and the interposing of entities. 3.1.12 There will be specific rules to ensure that interposed entities cannot be used to circumvent the loss ring-fencing rules. 3.1.13 There should not be any specific rules for allocating a taxpayer’s interest expenditure as between ring-fenced residential property and other assets. Option 3: Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper Land within the scope of the proposed rules 3.1.14 In addition to the design features in Option 2 for property within the scope of the proposed rules, three further exclusions are proposed. 3.1.15 All land that will definitely be subject to tax on sale will be excluded from these rules. 3.1.16 The rules will not apply to widely-held companies, because any residential land they hold is assumed to be incidental to their business. 3.1.17 The rules also will not apply to accommodation provided to employees or other workers where it is necessary to provide that accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business. Level at which the loss ring-fencing rules should apply (ie, at the individual property level or across a portfolio) 3.1.18 While the rules will generally apply on a portfolio basis, taxpayers will also be able to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish, so if a property is taxed on sale any remaining losses for that property can be released and used to offset against other income. If such an election is not made, then the rules will continue to apply on a portfolio basis. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 11 Using ring-fenced losses 3.1.19 Ring-fenced losses should be able to be transferred between companies in a wholly- owned group with rental income. It is not proposed that ring-fenced losses should be able to be carried back. 3.1.20 The usual shareholder continuity rules which apply to the use of losses by companies under the general corporate tax rules will continue to apply to ring-fenced losses. Losses should not be released and available to offset against other income if shareholder continuity is breached. Whether ring-fenced losses should be released on the sale of a residential property 3.1.21 There is no change from Option 2 for this design feature. Ring-fenced losses are able to be used on a sale of residential land that gives rise to taxable income, but only to the extent those losses reduce the taxable income to nil. What rules should be put in place to minimise opportunities to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules 3.1.22 There is no change from Option 2 for this design feature. There will be specific rules to ensure that interposed entities cannot be used to circumvent the loss ring-fencing rules, but no specific interest allocation rules. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? 3.2.1 The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; and • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. 3.2.2 Efficiency and fairness are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these two criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 12 3.3.1 As noted at section 2.4, because consideration of a capital gains tax is within the purview of the TWG, it is not considered here as a possible option for addressing the concern that investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain, and who are able to deduct expenses, have an unfair advantage over owner-occupiers – which is that not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. 3.3.2 Therefore, options considered are focussed on key design settings for loss ring- fencing, rather than consideration of alternatives to loss ring-fencing. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 13 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Option 1 Status quo Option 2 Design options proposed in the officials’ issues paper Option 3 Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper Efficiency and Neutrality 0 - The proposals would treat residential investment property differently to other investments. - This option introduces further exclusions from the rules in appropriate circumstances. Fairness and equity 0 ++ This option helps even the playing field between investors and owner-occupiers. ++ This option more accurately targets property investors. Efficiency of compliance 0 - This option would have required people other than property investors to apply new ring-fencing rules. 0 This option decreases compliance costs for people other than property investors compared to option 2 by excluding them from the new rules. Efficiency of administration 0 0 There would need to be relatively minor changes to some Inland Revenue forms and systems. 0 The design features from this option would impose no significant additional administration costs compared to Option 2. Overall assessment 0 + As the objective was to increase the fairness and equity of the tax system, this consideration outweighs the other considerations and overall we think this option is an improvement over the status quo. + As with Option 2, fairness and equity outweigh the other considerations. This option is an improvement over Option 2 with respect to the other considerations and is therefore the preferred option. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 14 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? 5.1.1 Officials consider the preferred option is Option 3: Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper. The reasons this option is the preferred approach are discussed below. Land within the scope of the proposed ring-fencing rules 5.1.2 As noted above, the proposed loss ring-fencing rules are to apply to residential land as already defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. For the reasons discussed below, we consider that the main home, mixed-use land, certain revenue account land, land owned by widely-held companies, and employee and farming accommodation should be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that land owned by companies and trusts should not be excluded. 5.1.3 It is noted that all of this option is generally neutral as compared to the status quo (no change from the current rules), because all of these options are around what land should be outside the scope of the proposed loss ring-fencing rules – which means the current treatment would remain applicable. Main home 5.1.4 As noted above, the concern the proposed ring-fencing rules are aimed at addressing is the uneven playing field between property speculators/investors and owner-occupiers. This is because rental losses can be used by investors to reduce their tax on income from other sources – effectively subsidising part of the cost of their mortgages, and helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. 5.1.5 The focus of the proposed rules is on loss-making rental properties, so it is recommended that a taxpayer’s main home be specifically excluded from the scope of the rules. Submitters on the officials’ issues paper have indicated that they agreed with this approach. 5.1.6 While part of someone’s main home may be rented out, and this activity could generate a loss, it is not considered that such a situation contributes to an uneven playing field between investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain and owner-occupiers. 5.1.7 We suggest that the concept of a “main home” mirror that used for the purposes of the bright-line test – which would mean that a person can have only one main home, and that to qualify for the exclusion the property has to be used predominantly as the person’s main home. However, we suggest one difference from the bright-line main home exclusion, in that a qualifying property should be used predominantly as the person’s main home for most of the income year in question, rather than for most of the time the person owns the property (which is the case for the bright-line main home exclusion). This makes more sense in the context of loss ring-fencing, as the focus is not on the length of ownership, but on Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 15 the use of the property. Mixed-use land 5.1.8 The existing definition of “residential land” would also include holiday houses that are sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out. Many such properties would be subject to the mixed-use asset rules. 5.1.9 The mixed-use asset rules provide for the apportionment of expenditure. Notwithstanding the apportionment formula, a tax loss can still arise for a mixed- use asset. This is more likely to occur when the income-earning use of the asset is low. Therefore, the mixed-use assets rules quarantine (or ring-fence) losses where there is low income-earning use of an asset. Under the quarantining rules, a person who is in an occasional loss position will not be able to offset their loss against other income in the current year, but will be able to use it against their future profits from the mixed-use asset. However, a person who is in perpetual loss will never have future profits to offset the losses against, and will therefore not be able to utilise them. 5.1.10 Property subject to the mixed-use asset rules should be scoped out of the ring- fencing rules, because the mixed-use asset rules will cover most if not all mixed- use asset losses. Certain revenue account land 5.1.11 We suggest that the ring-fencing rules should not apply to taxpayers who hold land on revenue account because they are in a land-related business. 6 Taxpayers in certain businesses relating to land hold their land on revenue account, so the profits on sale will be taxed. This applies to people in the business of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings. At balance date, such taxpayers may have a number of properties on hand, though they may not be currently rented out. The policy rationale for loss ring-fencing in these situations is weakened as the capital gains are already taxed. Submitters did not think the loss ring-fencing rules should apply to such taxpayers, as this could discourage new developments, which would be a barrier to increasing housing supply. 5.1.12 As discussed below, we suggest that rental losses are able to be used against taxable land sales to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced to future rental income or taxable gains on other land sales. While developers, dealers, etc, may have losses in respect of properties on hand at balance date, those losses being able to be used against income from other sales or rental activity in the year would mean that their businesses would be unlikely to be disadvantaged by the ring-fencing rules. In most cases the income from their sale or rental activity would be expected to exceed their losses. 5.1.13 However, in any overall loss-making year, we do not consider it necessary to ring- fence losses for these taxpayers. This would enable those taxpayers to use losses 6 As per section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 16 arising in any year against other income – for example within their consolidated group (as they are likely to be companies). There is not the same concern in relation to these taxpayers about any of their deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains, as all of their land is on revenue account. 5.1.14 In addition to the exclusions for revenue account land described in Option 2, submitters commented that all land that will definitely be subject to tax on sale should be excluded from these rules. This includes for example, land that was bought with the intention of resale or land that had been subject to more than minor development or division work within 10 years of acquisition. We recommend that if land is identified to Inland Revenue as being on revenue account not subject to any contingencies (for example, being sold within a particular time period), that land should be considered to be definitely subject to tax and excluded from the scope of the ring-fencing rules, as all of the economic income will be subject to tax. Land owned by companies and trusts 5.1.15 Some private sector advisers and submitters on the issues paper suggested that the ring-fencing rules should apply only to individuals (ie, natural persons) and look-through companies, and not to other companies or trusts. It was noted that company losses are effectively ring-fenced inside the company, as are losses in a trust. It was also noted that the rules would apply to some large companies (for example, large power companies that hold some residential rental property), imposing compliance costs on those companies, in circumstances that were unlikely to be the target of the reform. 5.1.16 While there is some argument that losses are ring-fenced within a company, so there is no need for the rules to apply to companies, officials do not consider that additional compliance costs for some large corporates would justify rules that apply only to individual taxpayers. This would leave open the possibility of holding rental properties in a company, trading trust, or family trust, and offsetting rental losses against other income. Limiting the ring-fencing rules to individuals would, therefore, significantly undermine the fairness of the rules. We therefore do not recommend this option. Land owned by widely-held companies 5.1.17 The design features in Option 2 included within the scope of the proposed ring- fencing rules all land held by trusts and companies, including land owned by widely-held companies. A number of submitters on the officials’ issues paper commented that applying the ring-fencing rules would create substantial compliance costs for large companies which are not the target of the proposal. It was noted that large companies often hold residential land incidentally to their business (for example as sites for future development, or for employee accommodation). In these circumstances, the mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the hope of capital gains from the properties is not present. For that reason we recommend that widely-held companies be excluded from the scope of the rules. Employee and farming accommodation Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 17 5.1.18 The design features in Option 2 did not carve out land used to provide accommodation to employees, or as part of their farming business. A number of submitters have suggested that these should be carved out of the ring-fencing rules. Submitters considered that such properties have no connection to the mischief the ring-fencing rules are seeking to address, and including them would create compliance costs without any corresponding benefit. 5.1.19 We agree that it would not undermine the rules to exclude accommodation provided to employees (or other workers, as will often be the case in farming) where it is necessary to provide that accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business. In such situations the perceived mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the hope of capital gains from the properties is not present. We therefore recommend such an exclusion. Level of ring-fencing 5.1.20 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules could be applied either on a property-by- property basis or on a portfolio basis. A portfolio approach would mean that investors could offset losses from one rental property against rental income from other properties, calculating their profit/loss on their overall portfolio. This may be seen as less equitable than a property-by-property approach, in that it may favour wealthier taxpayers with larger property holdings. A property-by-property basis would mean that each property is looked at separately, so losses on one cannot offset income from another. 5.1.21 A property-by-property approach could, in theory, be more effective in reducing tax benefits to investors. In practice, however, a property-by-property approach could result in de facto portfolio outcomes. Taxpayers could potentially rebalance their debt funding to avoid having loss-making properties, or at least minimise the extent to which any particular property is loss-making. 5.1.22 This taxpayer response would be inefficient, and may also mean that, in terms of the objective, a property-by-property approach may have no real advantage over a portfolio approach – adding complexity and increasing compliance costs for no gain. 5.1.23 Further, a property-by-property approach may be seen as unfair in that if a taxpayer has two properties and breaks even on the portfolio overall, the taxpayer’s tax position would depend on whether they break even on both properties or make a gain on one and a loss on the other. 5.1.24 Applying the rules on a portfolio basis would be significantly simpler than a property-by-property approach, from a compliance and administrative point of view, as this is how rental income is currently returned. The additional compliance costs a property-by-property approach would create, especially for investors holding many properties, was highlighted by private sector advisors. 5.1.25 We have looked at the approach to loss ring-fencing in other jurisdictions, and have not found any that apply an asset-by-asset approach. Typically, such rules are applied on a portfolio basis, or investments within particular categories are pooled (for example, in the United States, where ring-fencing applies to “passive activity” Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 18 losses). However, a property-by-property approach could arguably be more aligned to addressing concerns that large-scale investors who own multiple rentals are able to use losses on new acquisitions to continually reduce their tax. 5.1.26 Most submitters on the officials’ issues paper supported the rules applying on a portfolio basis, as it would be easier from a compliance point of view. However, some submitted that a portfolio approach penalises smaller “mum and dad” investors and favours investors with large portfolios. 5.1.27 Some submitters also suggested that taxpayers should be able to make an upfront election to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish. If a property is taxed on sale any remaining losses for that property could then be released. Officials do not see any issue with taxpayers electing to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they are willing to bear any associated compliance costs in order to be able to close out the net profit on that property. It is noted that some submitters advised they (or their advisors) already do this, so they did not see this as adding compliance costs for them. This option is desirable for taxpayers if it means any remaining losses after the taxable sale of a property can be released to be used against other income. We are recommending that be the case – this is discussed further in 5.1.41. 5.1.28 For the above reasons, we suggest that the ring-fencing rules generally apply on a portfolio basis, so a person with multiple properties would calculate their overall profit or loss across their whole residential portfolio. However, we also recommend that taxpayers who wish to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis should be allowed to do so. Using ring-fenced losses Grouping losses 5.1.29 In addition to the design features in Option 2, it has been submitted that losses should be able to be transferred between companies under the grouping rules. Often a corporate group will hold rental properties in a different entity to trading business properties. 5.1.30 We agree that ring-fenced losses should be able to be transferred between companies, but that this should be limited to companies in the same wholly-owned group, as the economic ownership is the same in that situation. It is acknowledged that this would be a higher threshold than is applied for the grouping of other losses. 5.1.31 Transferred losses should remain ring-fenced, so they are only able to be used in the relevant income year to the extent the transferee company has residential rental income or residential land sale income, with any remaining losses being carried forward and remaining ring-fenced. Carrying back ring-fenced losses 5.1.32 Some submitters suggested that losses should be able to be carried back as a typically profit-making property may make a loss in one year due, for example, to Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 19 large repairs and maintenance expenses or a period of vacancy. 5.1.33 We do not recommend that losses be able to be carried back. This would add complexity, and if a property is typically profit-making the carried forward losses would be available to offset against income in future years. Allowing losses to be carried back would also be inconsistent with general policy settings. Shareholder continuity 5.1.34 It has been submitted that companies could have losses ring-fenced when their overall position is tax paying, and that this would be unfair. It has been suggested either that the 49% shareholder continuity requirement should not apply to ring- fenced rental losses, or failing that, that if shareholder continuity is breached, losses should be made available to offset against other income. 5.1.35 The shareholder continuity rules reflect that it should be the shareholders at the time company losses arise who are able to benefit from them in the future. 5.1.36 We consider that it would undermine the credibility and fairness of the loss ring- fencing rules if ring-fenced rental losses were not subject to the shareholder continuity requirement, or if losses were released when continuity is breached. Release of losses on sale 5.1.37 In the case of a property with ring-fenced rental losses that is taxed under one of the land sale rules on disposal, there is an argument that the losses should be able to be fully utilised (ie, un-fenced) at that point, and be used to offset any other income of the taxpayer. This would reflect that all of the economic income from the investment has been taxed (the rental stream and the capital gain), and that the investor should not be penalised for making an overall loss on the investment. For this reason, not releasing losses that relate to a particular property on a taxable sale of that property would undermine neutrality and fairness. 5.1.38 However, if the rules are applied on a portfolio basis (which is the preferred option – see 5.1.21 to 5.1.27), allowing accumulated rental losses to give rise to a tax loss on a disposal subject to one of the land sale rules would create risks. For example, it would enable a portfolio investor to sell a property that has made a small capital gain within the bright-line period, offset that gain with ring-fenced losses from across their portfolio, and apply any remaining losses from the portfolio against other income. While there are ring-fencing rules in relation to the bright-line test, they only apply to deductions for the cost of the property, not other costs. 5.1.39 Enabling taxpayers to sell their lowest capital gain makers within the bright-line period and access what might be substantial portfolio-wide accumulated ring- fenced losses would significantly undermine the credibility of the rules. 5.1.40 Release on taxable sale, recognising that the full economic income had been taxed, would be the preferred option if the ring-fencing rules were to apply on a property-by-property basis. This is because it would only be losses that relate to the particular property that would be released. As noted at 5.1.21, a portfolio approach is preferred to a property-by-property approach because it would be Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 20 significantly simpler from a compliance and administrative point of view. However, as also noted at 5.1.27, we are recommending that taxpayers who wish to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis be able to do so. For those properties, we think that the preferred option of fully releasing the ring-fenced losses should be adopted. This design feature would be in addition to the features identified in Option A. The new design feature of allowing an election to apply the rules on a property-by-property approach enables all the losses associated with a given property to be used against that property upon a taxable sale. 5.1.41 We therefore do not consider that ring-fenced losses should generally be fully released on a taxable sale of residential property, meaning the losses (if not exhausted from offsetting the income derived on sale) would be able to be used to offset other income. However, for those properties which have had the rules applied to them on a property-by-property basis on the taxpayer’s election, we recommend that the losses become fully unfenced if they are taxed upon sale. This would also be the case where the rules applied on a portfolio basis and all of the properties in a portfolio were sold and taxed. This would most commonly be the case for land that was taxable under the bright-line test because it was sold within five years of acquisition. 5.1.42 We do not recommend that losses become released on any sale of residential land if there was no tax on the sale of that property. Releasing losses on a non-taxable disposal would reduce the impact of ring-fencing to one of timing alone, which would reduce the effectiveness of the measure. Anti-structuring rules 5.1.43 There are two main structuring opportunities that have been considered in terms of whether specific rules are required. These concern interest allocation and the interposing of entities. Specific interest allocation rules 5.1.44 Without specific interest allocation rules, investors (particularly larger and more sophisticated investors) may be able to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules. For example, by reorganising funding so that business assets other than rental properties are debt-funded, and rental properties are equity-funded, to the greatest extent possible. This could undermine the credibility of the rules, neutrality, and fairness. 5.1.45 However, interest allocation rules would add substantial complexity, and increase compliance and administrative costs. Because money is fungible, it is very difficult to attempt to match borrowings to particular investments (tracing). Stacking rules (eg, allocating debt firstly to ring-fenced investments) may be seen as unfair. And pro rata interest allocation between assets that are subject to the ring-fencing rules and those that are not would require regular valuation of assets. 5.1.46 If interest on any loan that was secured by a residential property was included in the rules, this would create issues for many taxpayers who use their rental properties to secure loans for their businesses. This would impact on small and medium business’ access to capital. In addition, many arrangements could be Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 21 even more difficult to apply interest allocation rules to, as revolving credit facilities are often used to fund both a rental property and a business. 5.1.47 The private sector advisors who officials consulted were strongly of the view that the substantial complexity that interest allocation rules would add should be avoided. It was observed that such complex rules would be particularly onerous for smaller taxpayers to comply with. 5.1.48 Given the substantial complexity that interest allocation rules would introduce, we recommend against such rules. The ring-fencing rules will affect many taxpayers, with varying levels of sophistication and tax knowledge, and we consider it important that they remain as easy to apply as possible, and minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. Specific rules for interposed entities 5.1.49 We have considered whether there should be specific rules to mitigate the risk of taxpayers interposing entities to get around the loss ring-fencing rules. 5.1.50 Without rules to deal with interposed entities, a simple way taxpayers (particularly larger and more sophisticated taxpayers) could get around ring-fencing rules would be by interposing an entity (eg, a company) to separate a loan (and interest deduction) from the residential rental property, so the interest is not subject to ring- fencing. This could undermine the credibility of the rules, neutrality, and fairness. 5.1.51 In the 1980s, New Zealand had a loss restriction provision that capped the extent to which losses from rental, agricultural and horticultural activities could be offset against other income (the maximum was $10,000 per annum). There was also a provision that clawed back interest and development expenditure where land was sold within ten years of acquisition and the profit derived on sale was not otherwise assessable. A major failing of the interest claw back provision was the absence of specific rules to deal with simple structuring such as that noted above. As a result, a common strategy was to hold the land in a company and incur interest on funds borrowed to buy shares in the company. This meant that no interest was incurred with respect to the land, so there could be no clawback of interest deductions on sale. 7 5.1.52 While there is a general anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act, it may not be adequate to prevent the simple interposing of an entity to get around loss ring- fencing, as there are legitimate non-tax reasons for holding property in an entity. In addition, it is preferable from a certainty perspective to have specific rules to counter avoidance concerns rather than rely on the uncertain boundary inherent in the general anti-avoidance rule. There would be some administrative costs associated with a specific rule to deal with interposed entities, as compliance would need to be monitored. However, compared to relying on the general anti-avoidance rule, this approach should reduce taxpayer compliance costs, uncertainty, and administrative costs. 7 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital (December 1989). Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 22 5.1.53 We therefore recommend a specific rule to deal with the interposing of entities, as this would otherwise be a simple mechanism to get around the loss ring-fencing rules, and would undermine their credibility. 5.1.54 The private sector advisors who officials consulted were in agreement that rules to deal with the above mechanism of interposing an entity should be developed, to maintain the integrity of the ring-fencing rules. 5.1.55 The officials’ issues paper consulted on a suggested approach to dealing with interposed entities. Submitters have proposed a number of technical refinements to the treatment of interposed entities proposed in Option 2, which we agree with. These are: • The 50% “residential property land-rich” threshold should take into account all residential properties, not just those within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. This is to ensure that the interposed entity rule applies even if the main home was held in the same entity as a rental property (which would often be worth less than the main home). We recommend that the rule therefore apply where over 50% of the entity’s assets are residential properties, not just residential properties within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. • Interest deductions for the owner of a “residential property land-rich” entity should not be ring-fenced to the extent the profit from the residential property or properties is sufficient to cover the interest, but is not distributed. This is appropriate as the properties are profitable overall, so there is no mischief in allowing the interest covered by the profits to be deducted in that year. • Where part of an entity’s capital is used to acquire a rental property, and part is applied to something else, the interest incurred by the shareholder to fund the entity’s capital should be allocated on a pro-rata basis between the uses to which the capital is applied. • Where the entity’s capital is used to acquire a rental property, and the entity also has another profitable activity that does not require any (or much) capital, the shareholder’s interest expenses should only be allocated to the extent of the entity’s profit from the rental activity. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Investors Residential property investors who negatively gear will face higher tax liabilities for as long $570m total over 5-year forec as t period (not High Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 23 8 Discussed further from paragraph 6.1,3, as they are making losses on their investment.

Uncertainty about housing market impacts 5.3.1 There is significant uncertainty about the net impact of the policy on the housing market, especially on the rental market. Overseas experience underlines the uncertainty in the direction and magnitude of housing market impacts. For example, negative gearing was banned in Australia between 1985 and 1987, and while rents spiked in Sydney during this period, they were flat or falling across much of the rest of the country. The exact relationship between the tax changes and observed changes in rent is unclear. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? 5.4.1 Yes. Benefit forec as ting period (not discounted) Non-monetised benefits Medium Low Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 25 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislative process 6.1.1 Following consultation and final decisions on the design of the proposed rules, primary legislation will be prepared to give effect to loss ring-fencing. 6.1.2 It is currently anticipated that loss ring-fencing rules will take effect from the 2019- 20 income year. It is planned that legislation will be introduced before the start 9 of the income year the rules will apply from (the 2019-20 income year) – giving most taxpayers a degree of certainty about how the rules will operate. Implementation options 6.1.3 The rules could either apply in full from the outset, or alternatively they could be phased in over three years (ie, a third of a taxpayer’s losses are ring-fenced in year one, then two-thirds of their losses in year two). Tax law changes are not usually phased in, but this possible approach has been suggested to allow affected investors more time to adjust to the new rules, or to rearrange their affairs before the rules apply in full. However, we note that phased introduction of the rules would result in some additional complexity. 6.1.4 The officials’ issues paper sought feedback on whether the rules should apply in full from the 2019-20 income year, or be phased in over two or three years. Submitters were strongly in favour of phasing the rules in over three years. 6.1.5 A number of submitters considered that existing rental properties should be grandparented, on the basis that such a fundamental change to the rules after investments have been made would be unfair. Other submitters suggested that the rules should apply in full for properties acquired after an announced date, but phased in for existing properties (or existing properties grandparented). Officials consider that these suggestions would produce overly complex rules, and recommend that the rules either apply in full from the outset, or be phased in for all properties over three years. 6.1.6 On balance however, Inland Revenue considers that phasing in the changes could potentially create a precedent-setting risk and there is a stronger argument to apply the rules in full from the 2019-20 income year for all properties. 6.1.7 The Treasury prefers a split approach, with no phasing for new investments, and a three-year phase in for existing investments. This is on the basis that investments made after the ring-fencing rules have been introduced do not need time to adjust to the new rules, while acknowledging that some time may be necessary for existing investments. 6.1.8 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have expressed a 9 For standard balance date taxpayers. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 26 preference for a phased introduction for both existing and new investments. This is because if there are sales of some low quality rental properties in anticipation of the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act standards, as expected, a phased introduction of the loss ring-fencing rules could strengthen incentives for new owners to upgrade these rental properties quickly. Responsibility for ongoing operation and enforcement 6.1.1 Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Communications 6.1.2 When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the new rules, and further explanation of the effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. The information on Inland Revenue’s website, booklets, etc, would be updated to explain the new rules to property investors. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? 6.2.1 Inland Revenue is currently delivering on its Business Transformation programme. It is anticipated that implementation of ring-fencing of rental losses will occur in START, as the proposed commencement date of 2019-20 occurs after the go-live of START major release 3 scheduled for April 2019. Implementation of the proposed rules will mean changes to START will be required. Officials expect these changes to be relatively minor. However, they are not yet fully scoped, costed and integrated into Inland Revenue’s 2019-20 annual returns plan, creating an implementation risk. 6.2.2 Successful implementation is based on taxpayers understanding the changes and how they apply to their situation. For those electing to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis, this explaining the changes in a simple way for them to understand may present an implementation risk. Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 27 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? 7.1.1 Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.1.2 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment currently investigates trends in house prices and housing affordability, using a variety of measures to get a complete picture of affordability. For home buyers, this includes the level of house prices, how house prices compare to incomes, and the experimental Housing Affordability Measure for first home buyers. For renters, the data monitored includes rent levels and the Housing Affordability Measure for renters. The impact of loss ring-fencing may be seen in an improvement in measures of housing affordability for home purchasers, and may also be seen in the proportion of houses in each area that are purchased by first home buyers and investors – with the percentage of property purchased by first home buyers expected to increase over time as a result of the ring-fencing rules. The impact on rental affordability will be monitored to identify if there appear to be any significant negative impacts on renters from the policy. There is significant uncertainty about the scale of the potential impact of the policy on the housing market. Furthermore, because of the substantial number of factors that affect the housing market, including other policy interventions under development, it is likely to be difficult from a practical perspective to identify the causal impact of the proposed loss ring-fencing rules on affordability for first-home buyers, though housing affordability data may give some indication of the impact of the policy. 7.1.3 We will also monitor data on the amount of ring-fenced rental losses, which will provide an indication of the impact of the policy, and whether the proposed anti- structuring rules are effective. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? 7.2.1 We will monitor the first year of operation of new legislation, and if we identify anything that suggests a formal review is warranted we will undertake that – for example data that suggests significant negative impacts on the rental housing market. Stakeholders will have the ability to raise concerns with us, and if there is a need to make remedial amendments to the new rules these will be prioritised for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposed amendments would go through the GTPP. 7.2.2 It is noted that if a comprehensive capital gains tax were to be implemented, loss ring-fencing would be reviewed at that time.
Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 1 Impact Summary: Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Section 1: General information Purpose The Inland Revenue Department is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Quality of data used for impact analysis Inland Revenue used public information available on holders of pre-1990 emission units to inform our analysis of the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary. This information, however, did not provide any insights about taxpayers’ use of the emission units, including decision-making behaviours over holding or trading these units. Targeted consultation with interested stakeholders was carried out to bridge this gap in our knowledge; however, for the reasons set out below, there were time constraints on the period of consultation. Consultation and testing A private sector stakeholder who raised the initial concerns about the tax treatment of arrangements to securitise emission units was influential in shaping the problem definition. While the ideal response to the concern was to include the issue in a wider context as part of an examination of the use of the financial arrangement rules, the scheduling of this review meant it could not address this issue in a sufficiently timely manner. Analysis of the problem definition and possible options for change led officials to conclude that there was a case for developing an interim solution, focusing on pre-1990 forestry emissions units only, which would address the stakeholder’s concern. The recommended interim solution is consistent with current tax policy settings and the framework underpinning the interim solution is sustainable and robust. A consequence of developing the interim solution in a sufficiently timely manner was that it truncated the timeframe that would otherwise be available for consultation to just over one week. Engagement with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sector was high, with most responding either via telephone or letter. Subject to decisions by Cabinet, further consultation on the detailed design of the proposal will be carried out before final decisions, as delegated by Cabinet, are made by Ministers. The wider review of the financial arrangement rules is on the Government’s tax policy work programme and will consider if the scope of the interim solution should be extended. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 2 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department May 2018 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 3 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? This Regulatory Impact Analysis addresses the question of whether current taxation laws, particularly the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Income Tax Act), impedes financial decision-making by holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units that are held for intergenerational purposes. Pre-1990 forestry emissions units New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) distinguishes between pre-1990 forest land and post-1989 forest land, 1990 being the base year of measurement under the Paris agreement, The scheme places mandatory deforestation obligations on exotic forests that were first established before 1990, referred to as ‘pre-1990 forests’. This means if pre-1990 landowners choose to deforest, for example when converting forest land to a different use, they face ‘deforestation liabilities’ under the ETS, have to report on emissions and surrender an equivalent amount of New Zealand emission units to the Government. When the ETS was introduced, owners of ‘pre-1990 forests’, were able to apply for a one-off free allocation of New Zealand emissions units. This allocation was intended to recognise the possible impact on land values due to the cost New Zealand’s ETS places on deforesting, and the resulting reduction in land-use flexibility. A wide variety of owners applied for the free units, including farmers with small forest holdings, regional councils, owners of large commercial forests, and Māori entities who received forest land as part of treaty settlements. In total, nearly 48 million pre-1990 units were issued, 38 million of which are still held today, some of which have been either sold or surrendered. The tax treatment also distinguishes between pre-1990 forestry emissions units and post-1989 forestry emissions units. As a transitional measure, the first disposal of emissions units by taxpayers who received the initial allocation of pre-1990 emission units is not treated as income under the Income Tax Act. Subsequent transactions are subject to normal tax treatment on disposal. The special tax treatment for pre-1990 emission units reflects the transitional nature of those units under the ETS, as outlined above. Public information on the use of pre-1990 forestry emissions units suggests that a large proportion are held long-term. As the units themselves do not produce income, the cash value of these assets can only be realised on disposal. For holders that want to take a long-term inter-generational approach, the units can represent an unproductive asset. The Inland Revenue Department (Inland Revenue) was approached by a private sector stakeholder about changing the Income Tax Act so that unit holders could extract value from the emission units using sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements without triggering a sale for tax purposes. Sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements It is a well-established principle of interpretation that the tax treatment of a transaction follows its legal form. When a taxpayer sells property, such as pre-1990 forestry emission units, with a compulsory obligation to buy the same or equivalent property back, the tax rules treat the transaction as a disposal – that is, the taxpayer alienates all rights in the property. By treating the sale and compulsory buy-back arrangement as a disposal for tax purposes, taxpayers extinguish the benefit of the tax transitional treatment for pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Economically, however, the transaction is a loan or lease of property. As the Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 4 tax treatment follows the legal form of the transaction rather than its economic substance, tax law can act as an impediment to unit holders seeking to extract value from emissions units that are held for inter-generational purposes. Agreements involving the sale and compulsory buy back of property are typically referred to as “securitization”. Securitization usually involves using a long-term asset as security in return for a payment for up to the asset’s worth that is repayable at a specified later date. The borrower can use the asset for the period but the expectation is that the asset or an asset of an equivalent nature will be returned to the lender when the monies are paid back. As the set of transactions is in-substance a loan or lease, the tax consequences should follow the difference in the net cash flows as a measure of income, expenditure or loss arising from the arrangement. A netting approach is more consistent with existing tax policy frameworks when economic ownership of the asset is not surrendered. Case for change The approach to Inland Revenue for legislative reform was motivated by a unit holder wanting to enter into a significant transaction that would allow them to lend the emissions units to a third party who will likely use the units to offset liabilities connected with their emissions. Because the agreement requires the unit holder to reacquire the units at a specified future date, the property rights in the units cannot be said to have been extinguished or disposed of. In return for the emissions units, the unit holders would receive monies that could be used to produce income, such as interest. Tax law, however, inhibits such arrangements as they would result in the pre-1990 forestry emissions units losing their one-off tax-free status, and limits options for unit holders to seek opportunities to maximise the value from otherwise unproductive assets on their balance sheet. Work on the issue was initially planned for late 2018. However, an impetus for dealing with this issue more quickly is the fact that the stakeholder who approached Inland Revenue is planning to enter into a sale and buyback transaction of pre-1990 forestry emissions units by the end of May 2018. In the absence of the proposed change, the transaction is unlikely to take place. There is high confidence in the evidence and assumptions underpinning the case for change. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The key group of taxpayers affected by the change are holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Preliminary indications from this group, via targeted consultation with a selected group of unit holders with an interest in inter-generational asset retention and growth, were supportive of any reform that would allow them to maximise value from these units without losing any tax transitional benefits. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 5 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Tax issues with securitization of assets are not isolated to pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Other assets that could be securitised can be similarly affected, but reforming tax law generally for all assets at this stage has a risk of unintended consequences. Inland Revenue does not have sufficient evidence at this time to advance regulatory reform, even at an in- principle level, for the treatment of long term assets that are not pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Developing a response for pre-1990 forestry emission units only at this time is a reflection of the constraints on our analysis. The wider issues concerning the securitization of assets are scheduled to be considered as part of the review of the financial arrangement rules as announced as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 6 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The main objective is to ensure that the tax system recognises the economic substance of arrangements that securitise pre-1990 forestry emissions units and ensures that tax law does not inhibit opportunities to maximise the value of those units. The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Effectiveness: the options should not act as a disincentive for holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to maximise value from those units. • Sustainability: the options should maintain the integrity of the income tax, and operate coherently with the frameworks used by the Income Tax Act. • Fairness: the options should apply equally to all taxpayers. Like-transactions should have similar or equivalent tax outcomes. • Administration efficiency and compliance efficiency: the option should not introduce new processes or procedures that would not otherwise arise under the Income Tax Act. As the obligations, rights and entitlements of taxpayers are prescribed by legislation, non- legislative responses, apart from the status quo (which does not meet the main objective), are not viable. Effectiveness was the most important criterion at it aligned closest with the main objective. There was little difference between the options in terms of impact on compliance and administration efficiencies. Option one: Status quo Under the status quo, the sale and compulsory buy-back arrangement is treated as a disposal for tax purposes and taxpayers lose the benefit of the tax transitional treatment for pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Current tax policy settings inhibit unit holders from maximising the value of pre-1990 forestry emissions units unless they are sold. As such, the option is not effective and does not meet the main objective. The status quo is consistent with interpretation principles insofar as the Income Tax Act applies to transactions involving the transfer of property. As such, the status quo is arguably fair. Officials are aware, however, that broader concerns have been expressed that the current position is not sustainable and for this reason the tax treatment of sale and compulsory buy- back arrangements is part of a proposed review of the financial arrangement rules on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Option two: Apply the principles of the financial arrangement rules to securitised pre- 1990 forestry emissions unit transactions Under option two the securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units would be treated as a financial arrangement under the Income Tax Act. The financial arrangement rules tax all returns on financial arrangements on an accrual basis over the term of the arrangement, including the returns on instruments that can alter the incidence of those returns. Tax outcomes under the financial arrangement rules would align with the economic substance of Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 7 the securitization arrangement. This outcome means that option two is effective for the purpose of meeting unit holder expectations regarding their tax obligations and preserves the special tax transitional treatment of pre-1990 forestry emission units until such time as the unit holder choses to alienate their rights to the units. Option two uses existing tax frameworks in the Income Tax Act and is sustainable because it maintains the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that interest cash flows created by the arrangement are appropriately taxed. Option two does not rely on the creation of new frameworks and does not create any new or additional compliance or administration costs and meets the administration and compliance cost efficiency criterion. This option could result in market changes regarding the supply and demand of pre-1990 forestry emissions. Commoditizing such emissions units improves market liquidity but also introduces market risk (such as price and counter party default). We expect that holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units would carry out appropriate due diligence before entering into any sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements to mitigate these risks. The option does not fully meet the fairness criterion as it applies to pre-1990 forestry emissions units only. The fairness criterion would be fully met if the proposed approach applied to emissions units generally. Widening the scope of option two is not preferred at this time although officials will be considering in the coming months whether it would be desirable to also include post-1989 forestry emissions units in the proposed amendment prior to the legislation being introduced late this year. Originally, Inland Revenue had intended to discuss the securitization of emissions units in an officials’ issues paper for later in 2018. However, the impetus for dealing with pre-1990 forestry emissions units more quickly is the fact that a key stakeholder is planning to enter into a sale and buy-back transaction at the end of May 2018 and has sought an assurance from Ministers that there is support for legislative change to the Income Tax Act to ensure that tax law reflects the economic substance of the transaction. Preliminary feedback from stakeholders has been supportive of option two. Other options: Apply the principles of the share lending rules to pre-1990 forestry emissions units Other options were briefly considered. For example, the share lending rules which are based on a similar securitization concept. Share lending involves the lending of shares to another party for a fee. The share lending rules in the Income Tax Act tax transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form. The share lending rules met some of the evaluation criteria (effectiveness, and administration and compliance efficiency) but did not adequately reflect the underlying cash flows under this particular type of securitization arrangement as the share lending rules are specifically targeted to shares. Therefore, it was dismissed as an option as it was not sustainable, notwithstanding its effectiveness. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 8 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option two, which relies on the principles and framework of the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act to appropriately tax securitization arrangements involving pre-1990 forestry emissions units. This option is preferred as it meets the main objective and is effective and sustainable. By using existing frameworks in the Income Tax Act, it does not create new compliance or administrative processes. The proposed approach has no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems.

Low Total Monetised Benefit Low Non-monetised benefits Low Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 10 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Inland Revenue officials are aware that a review of the emissions trading scheme is currently underway. The proposed approach is not anticipated to have any impacts on the outcome of this review. To provide certainty for stakeholders, the proposed approach would apply from the start of the 2018-19 income year for transactions entered into from that year. Applying the change from this time gives assurance and certainty to the stakeholder (and others) who initially raised concerns that the Income Tax Act was limiting opportunities for holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to maximise the value of those assets. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 11 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The problem with the current tax rules as they apply to securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units was brought to Inland Revenue’s attention by a specific taxpayer. Taxpayer secrecy prevents Inland Revenue from naming this taxpayer. The taxpayer has been consulted throughout the policy development process. Inland Revenue also undertook targeted in-confidence consultation, via letter, with a selection of the larger holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to test initial reactions to the proposed approach. The letter sought stakeholder views about the proposed change. Feedback supported a change from the status quo. Inland Revenue also carried out follow up contact via telephone with stakeholders. Their feedback was very positive. One submitter suggested the amendment should extend to the securitization of any forestry emissions units, not just pre-1990 forestry emissions units. The submitter’s point is that owners of post-1989 forestry emissions units tend to retain them to cover the future surrender obligations that arise under the emissions trading scheme when the forests are harvested. Being able to securitize those units in the meantime would be useful for the owners of post- 1989 forestry emissions units. Over the coming months Inland Revenue will consider and report back to Ministers on whether the proposed amendment should be extended to all emissions units, or alternatively, whether any extension should be left to be considered as part of the financial arrangements issues paper. This consideration should not, however, hold up obtaining Cabinet agreement to a legislative tax amendment for pre-1990 forest land emissions units. More generally, Inland Revenue considers any wider securitisation issues should be considered as part of the proposed review of the taxation of financial arrangements, which is planned for later in 2018. The outcome of this review is not expected to result in changes that would be inconsistent with the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary. Separate from the review of the taxation of financial arrangements, an additional round of consultation is proposed about the detailed design of the proposed approach before final policy decisions are made by Ministers. Cabinet is being asked to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to finalise the detailed design of the proposed approach. Another round of consultation will also be available as part of Parliament’s consideration of any legislative amendment through the Parliamentary select committee process. The Treasury was consulted as part of the policy development process and supports the measure being taken to Cabinet for approval. The Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry for the Environment and the Office of Treaty Settlements were also consulted and did not identify any concerns with the proposed approach. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 12 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 is necessary to implement option two. These amendments would be included in an omnibus taxation bill planned for later in 2018 . The changes would apply to securitization transactions entered into by taxpayers from the 2018-19 and later income years. Stakeholder feedback has not highlighted any concerns regarding compliance with the proposed approach and it has been positively received. When the bill is introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be concurrently released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin series, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that the proposed approach can be implemented and made effective for transactions entered into anytime from the start of the 2018-19 income year. Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 13 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes as per the objectives of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that the proposed approach meets its objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Monitoring of the proposed approach will be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? A proposed review of the financial arrangement rules is on the Government’s tax policy work programme for later 2018. It will consider a variety of financial arrangement taxation issues ranging from remedial to policy enhancements to ensure the rules work as intended. This review will ultimately involve the preparation of a public consultation document and the opportunity for stakeholders to comment. Any concerns identified by stakeholders about the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary, including its possible extension to other assets, would be considered as part of this review.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet and stakeholders to be consulted on a Government discussion document. 1. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 3 of 107 2 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Completeness of analysis The analysis of the options presented in this document is not yet complete. However, this analysis will be completed before final policy decisions are made. Consultation with stakeholders, including through the Government discussion document, will inform the analysis. A key gap in the analysis to date is that estimates of potential GST revenue collections have not yet been completed for options 3 and 4. Evidence of the problem There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the foregone GST on imported low-value goods under the current de minimis 1 threshold. Quality of data used for impact analysis It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers could be required to register and return GST under the preferred option. It is also not possible to determine exactly how much GST revenue is foregone on low-value goods imported under the de minimis from offshore and consumed in New Zealand. Officials estimate, based on a ‘bottom up’ approach (using 2016 data from New Zealand Post and couriers on numbers of low-value consignments and Customs’ sample data and Australian estimates on values), that around $80 million of GST was foregone in 2016 on these purchases. This amount could be growing at a rate of 10% per annum, based on a 12% five-year average rate of growth in volumes of low-value goods and taking into account that the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower-value end. The estimated impact is dependent on the behavioural response of offshore suppliers and New Zealand consumers to the introduction of an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value goods. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis We have assumed that larger offshore supplier of goods and e- marketplaces would voluntarily comply with the proposed requirement to register and return GST , given the reputational risk involved in not complying. For the purposes of the analysis, the “compliance rate” does not refer to the proportion of offshore suppliers who would have a liability to register for GST under the preferred option, but instead the percentage of goods (by dollar value) that would be supplied by offshore suppliers who would register and voluntarily comply with the rules. For these reasons, a 75 percent compliance rate is thought to be reasonable. This assumption has been used in calculating the estimated GST revenue collections under the preferred option shown in the table in Section 4. We note that New Zealand applied GST to offshore suppliers of services in October 2016 and there has been a high level of compliance with the new rules. However, we also note that consumption of online services is more concentrated among a small number of large suppliers compared to the market for low-value goods. 1 The Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures requires setting a de minimis and New Zealand is a party to this Protocol. The current de minimis is $60 duty owing. It means no duty is collected on low-value imported goods if the total duty is less than $60. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 4 of 107 3 If offshore suppliers and marketplaces perceive the compliance costs of registering for and returning New Zealand GST to be unreasonably high, there is a risk that they may not comply with the rules or may not continue to supply goods to New Zealand. Table 1 below shows the effect of relaxing the above compliance assumption and assuming instead a level of compliance of 50%. This is considered to be a very low compliance rate, given the proposed inclusion of rules to require e-marketplaces (some of which have a large share of the goods market) to register and return GST on goods sold to New Zealand consumers through their distribution platforms. Based on a range of compliance assumptions (50%, 75% and 100%), the numbers in Table 1 represent the estimated additional amount of GST that may be returned under the preferred option, over and above the amount of GST that would otherwise be collected at the border if the status quo was retained. These figures do not take into account the tariff revenue and border fees that are currently collected on goods valued at or below $1,000. Table 1: Additional GST revenue that may be returned by registered offshore suppliers ($ millions - fiscal year) Assumed compliance 2019/20 Application at 1 October 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 50% 20 31 35 41 75% 43 64 72 81 100% 66 97 108 121 Based on our data and assumptions, the break-even rate of compliance (where the GST returned by offshore suppliers is equal to what would otherwise be collected if the status quo is retained) would be 28 percent for the 2019/20 fiscal year. Estimated coverage rates of 85% (by value) of low-value goods sent through the fast freight stream and 70% through the postal stream have been used to take into account the effect of including rules which require marketplaces to register and return GST in respect of goods sold through those marketplaces to New Zealand consumers. The total foregone GST revenue has been calculated based on an assumption that the total value of goods under the current de minimis is growing at 10% per annum. The forecasted potential GST collections under option 2 have also been calculated on the basis of this assumption as well as the assumption that the value of GST that would otherwise be collected by Customs under the status quo collection system will continue to grow at 5% per annum on average. It is assumed that the application of GST to low-value imported goods would not have a significant impact on consumers’ purchasing behaviour. The extent to which consumers would bear the incidence of the tax if the preferred option is implemented is unknown and will depend on the rate of compliance and on whether, if registered, the offshore supplier passes the cost on to the consumer. This may be industry or firm specific and will depend on factors such as business practices and the elasticity of demand for products. It is assumed that in most cases the consumer would bear most of the incidence of the tax. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 5 of 107 4 Consultation and testing We have undertaken a limited consultation at this stage and plan to undertake a fuller consultation with stakeholders through submissions on the discussion document and targeted meetings with key stakeholders. Responsible Managers (signature and date): Chris Gillion Anna Cook Policy Manager Director Policy Policy and Strategy Policy, Legal and Governance Inland Revenue New Zealand Customs Service 20 July 2017 20 July 2017 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 6 of 107 5 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? In principle, GST should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods, as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. However, GST is currently collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether tariffs are payable. The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. Non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. The implication of this is that domestic businesses are at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also obviously means that the Government is foregoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand; based on a five-year average, the number of imported low-value goods is growing at about 12 percent per annum and the Government is foregoing an increasing amount of GST. Foregone revenue Estimates of the foregone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated, using a top- down approach based on credit card data, a ‘maximum potential’ fore gone GST revenue figure of a pproximately $140 million per annum. Officials have done further work using a ‘bottom-up approach’ which indicates a lower potential fore gone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. The growth of business-to-consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value at 10 percent per year 2 , the amount of foregone GST is forecasted to grow to $127 million by 2021. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as t here are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. International developments The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. 2 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 12%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 7 of 107 6 From 1 July 2018 Australia will require offshore suppliers to return GST on low-value imported goods (valued at AU$1,000 or less) . However, the Australian Productivity Commission is undertaking a review of the effectiveness of this model and of other possible GST collection models . The European Union has indicated that it intends to introduce an offshore supplier registration scheme to collect VAT on low- value goods from 2021. Singapore also announced a proposal to introduce an offshore supplier registration model for collecting GST on imported goods (valued at or below S$400) and cross-border services and intangibles. No details have yet been provided for the intended application date. The broad framework of Singapore’s proposed rules is consistent with Australia’s new rules and with the systems for cross-border intangibles and services that operate in the EU Member States, New Zealand, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Norway, Switzerland and South Africa. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The preferred option involves requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on their supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers valued at or below $1,000. At the same time, the de minimis for collecting GST and other duties on imported goods at the border would be increased to $1,000 to reflect the fact that GST would now be collected on these goods at the point of sale (rather than at the border). Government The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST and forego tariffs. Cost recovery fees which fund Customs’ and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ risk management activities at the border would also be foregone and would presumably be replaced by additional Crown funding. In 2016, the amount of tariffs collected was $5.2 million and cost recovery fees were $17 million. Domestic businesses New Zealand-based retailers are in favour of levying GST on low-value imported goods as they are concerned that the non-collection of GST places them at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. Footwear and clothing manufactures would be affected by the removal of tariff duty on footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold. The impacts on the different parties along the supply chain (offshore suppliers, fast freight New Zealand Post and consumers) are detailed below. Offshore suppliers and online marketplaces Offshore suppliers (including e- marketplaces) meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of registering and returning GST. Smaller suppliers who fall below this registration threshold would be unaffected (provided that they are certain that they are below the threshold). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 8 of 107 7 It is possible that some smaller suppliers may not know if they might realistically make supplies to New Zealand consumers exceeding the $60,000 registration threshold and therefore may prefer to stop supplying to New Zealand customers rather than go through the exercise of figuring out whether they are liable to register (and then registering for GST if they are). However, it is expected that a lot of these smaller suppliers would sell their goods through an e-marketplace, in which case the marketplace would bear the compliance costs of registering and returning GST. E- marketplaces may be more likely to accept these compliance costs due to their greater resources and larger overall share of the market. Fast freight Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and fees on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This would generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. New Zealand Post Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. Consumers Costs and savings Under the preferred option, consumers would pay GST on imported goods under the current de minimis ( which they currently would not pay any GST or other duty on ) where these goods are supplied by a registered offshore supplier. This means that in some instances they would pay more overall for a low-value good purchased from an offshore business. However, this will not be the case if they purchase a low-value good from a supplier that does not meet the $60,000 registration threshold. Some imported goods valued between $400 and $1000, on which GST and other duty is currently collected, w ould become cheaper for consumers as a result of the proposal to not collect tariffs and border fees. As a result of foregoing tariffs and border fees on goods with a value of $1,000 or less, low-value goods will also be processed through the border faster, resulting in consumers seeing improvements in the timeliness of delivery. Access to goods As long as offshore suppliers’ compliance costs are kept to an acceptable minimum through simplified rules , it is not expected that the preferred option would significantly restrict consumers’ access to goods from offshore. However, there is a possibility of reduced access to goods if offshore suppliers and e- marketplaces refuse to supply goods to New Zealand customers as a result of the proposal. During the May 2017 Australian Senate inquiry on Australia’s new offs hore supplier registration system, e-Bay expressed opposition to the proposal and noted that it might geo- block Australian consumers from buying goods on its platform. It should be noted, however, that the then-proposed implementation date for the proposal was 1 July 2017 which, according to submitters, did not allow offshore suppliers and e- marketplaces enough time to prepare for the changes so that they could comply with the new rules. As a result of the concerns expressed by submitters and the lack of consideration of other options, the application date for the legislation was delayed to 1 July 2018. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 9 of 107 8 Increased certainty and simplicity The elimination of tariff duties and border fees on goods valued at or below $1,000 coupled with the supplier charging GST at the point of sale would provide consumers with greater certainty of the total cost of their imported goods compared with the status quo. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? An option where financial intermediaries are responsible for returning GST on credit card purchases of low-value goods from offshore was briefly considered and quickly ruled out. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered this option and it was thought to be not fe asible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to determine if a good or service was supplied by an offshore supplier ( and if they did, they likely would not to be able to tell if it was consumed overseas or in New Zealand). Options 1, 3 and 4 (see below) were being analysed by Customs, Inland Revenue and the Treasury as part of the policy development process, but Ministers decided that the Government discussion document would focus only on the offshore supplier registration option (option 2). The main reason for this is because it is the most efficient method of collecting GST on low value goods, and because o ther countries, particularly Australia, seem to be moving towards offshore supplier registration as an option for collecting GST/VAT on low-value imports ( which means that New Zealand may benefit from following these early adopters) . The benefits to New Zealand of international consistency in the adoption of an offshore supplier registration system are discussed further in Section 3. One interdependency is with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade’s ongoing work on tariffs. Under the preferred option, tariffs would be not be collected on imported goods with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs’ border risk management and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ current biosecurity processes are reliant on information about the content of low-value goods . For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Data from tariff codes are used by the Ministry for Primary Industries and Customs to risk assess consignments at the border. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and the Ministry of Primary Industries’ risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border, as well as Customs’ revenue collection activities) from goods with a value of $1,000 or less. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 10 of 107 9 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The overarching objectives of this project are to improve the collection of GST on low-value imported goods and, in doing so, to ensure competitive neutrality, so that the GST treatment of low-value imported goods is no different to goods sold domestically. This requires the consideration of the usual tax policy objectives such as the broad-base, low rate framework, efficiency of collection and sustainability of GST revenue. This work also requires the balancing of wider Government objectives against these tax policy objectives. These wider Government objectives include minimising as far as is practicable any reduction in consumer welfare associated with the broadening of the GST base, as well as Customs’ and the Ministry of Primary Industries’ objective of maintaining the current levels of border protection. To be effective in addressing the problem identified, it is necessary that the chosen solution must perform well against our tax policy objectives. However, because of the Government’s wider objectives, strong performance against the tax policy objectives is not sufficient in itself; therefore, possible impacts related to consumer welfare, border risk management and biosecurity must also factor into the analysis. The following key has been used for assessing how well the options perform against these objectives, compared with the status quo:  Significantly better than the status quo  Better than the status quo  Worse than the status quo Three policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: • Option 1: Retain the current GST and tariff duty collection processes where no GST or tariff duty is collected at the border on goods below the de minimis. This is the status quo option which the other options are being assessed against. • Option 2: Require offshore suppliers to register for, collect and return GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand resident customers and remove tariff duty and border fees from goods valued at or below $1,000. • Option 3: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST and tariff duty on low-value goods purchased from offshore suppliers (known as a “pay after delivery” or “reverse charge” mechanism). • Option 4: Require fast freight courier companies and New Zealand Post to collect GST and tariff duty on imported goods above a lowered de minimis. The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: A dministrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as practicable. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 11 of 107 10 • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the foregone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about. C ounteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. Option 1: Status quo Assessment against objectives Foregone GST (2016) Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection $80 million Does not meet Meets Meets Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity Under the status quo, consumers pay GST on imported goods to Customs if the total duty on the good (including GST and tariffs) is $60 or more. $400 is commonly understood as the value at which a parcel is likely to be assessed for revenue by Customs and is based on the assumption that GST is the only duty applying to the good. In some instances, the current system is not simple or certain for consumers to interact with. For example, a consumer that imports a good valued between $226 and $400 on which tariff duty of 10% applies might be surprised to discover that they are liable to pay GST, tariff duty and a cost recovery fee to Customs if they want their good to be released. Efficiency of compliance The status quo does not impose compliance costs on offshore suppliers of goods. When consumers import goods above the de minimis, they are required to enter into a second transaction to pay the GST and border fees (and tariff duty, if applicable) on their goods to Customs. They are also likely experience delays associated with the collection of revenue on their goods. Fast freight courier companies currently collect GST on goods above the de minimis where these goods are sent through the fast freight stream, which imposes some administrative costs on them. New Zealand Post incurs costs in checking consignments over the de minimis. Efficiency of administration Increasing volumes of low-value goods place pressure on the current revenue collection processes, some of which are manual and resource intensive. Unless better information, particularly in the postal stream, becomes available, there are logistical challenges and costs involved with managing increasing volumes. Fairness and equity The current tax collection process places domestic businesses at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore businesses that can supply low-value goods directly to New Zealand consumers without the imposition of GST. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 12 of 107 11 Sustainability and neutrality The issues of competitive neutrality would remain unaddressed and are likely to worsen over time if the growth in online shopping for low-value goods continues to grow more rapidly than domestic spending on consumer goods. Incremental improvements to efficiency of collection under the current system will become possible over time with better data availability (including advance parcel data from the postal system); however, it is uncertain that this will be enough to be sustainable in the long term, given the existing pressures on the system and the rate of growth in parcel volumes. In the medium term, increased system pressures (including delivery delays for consumers) are likely if investment in border processing capacity is not made or lags behind the growth in online shopping. Option 2: Offshore supplier registration (preferred option) Assessment against objectives and status quo Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection $43 million in 2019/20, expected to grow to $81 million in 2022/23    Under this option, tariff revenue and border fees would not be collected on goods with a value of $1,000 or less. GST would not be collected from offshore suppliers who make total supplies to New Zealand consumers below the $60,000 GST registration threshold in a 12-month period. The collection would also be impacted by the level of compliance. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity This system is widely used internationally for taxing cross-border services and domestic supplies. It should therefore be familiar to international suppliers who supply both services and goods or who are resident in countries with a VAT or GST. Australia has recently enacted legislation which will apply GST to low-value goods supplied by non-residents using an offshore supplier registration system from 1 July 2018. If this option is implemented in New Zealand from 1 October 2019, a number of suppliers may have already registered and returned GST under Australia’s rules by this time, so they would already be familiar with such a system for goods. New Zealand’s GST system is broad-based, with a single rate and almost no exemptions for goods, and therefore should be relatively simple for offshore suppliers to comply with. However, there will be more GST collection entities compared to the status quo. The charging of GST by the supplier at the point of sale, coupled with the removal of tariff duties and border fees on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 would provide increased upfront certainty for consumers regarding the total cost to them of the goods they import. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 13 of 107 12 Efficiency of compliance This option would impose compliance costs on offshore suppliers, most of whom would not be required at present to interact with New Zealand’s GST system. However, compliance costs to offshore suppliers should be relatively minimal because New Zealand’s GST system is simple compared to other VAT/GST systems around the world. However, there could be significant upfront IT system upgrade costs. Implementing simplified registration processes and other rules aimed at minimising compliance costs are expected to keep compliance costs to an acceptable minimum for the majority of the large offshore suppliers who are well- resourced and who are more likely to have IT systems in place that have the capability to account for GST on supplies to New Zealand consumers. There would be administration cost savings to courier companies, who would no longer collect GST on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000, but will have to provide information to Customs for border and biosecurity risk management. Efficiency of administration This option is relatively efficient to administer given systems are already in place to register offshore suppliers of cross-border services as well as domestic suppliers. There would be modest administration cost savings to Customs. Fairness and equity Offshore suppliers would be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. Consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase low-value goods from a domestic or offshore supplier as both suppliers would be required to return GST on that supply. Sustainability and neutrality From a tax policy standpoint, this option is neutral because offshore suppliers would be subject to the same GST rules that apply to domestic suppliers (including the $60,000 registration threshold which applies in the domestic context). The sustainability and neutrality of this option in practice depends on the extent to which liable offshore suppliers comply with the rules. Failure on the part of large international suppliers of low value goods (including the prominent marketplaces) to comply with their tax obligations would pose a significant reputational risk to these suppliers. Where similar rules have been applied in other countries to tax cross-border services and intangibles, offshore suppliers have demonstrated a willingness to comply. This has been the experience in New Zealand so far with the new GST rules for cross-border services and intangibles. I t is therefore expected that the majority of the largest offshore suppliers would voluntarily comply. We do not know yet if consumers’ access to goods would be significantly reduced. Delivery times may also be shorter, or at least would not be any slower t han under the status quo. Option 3: Pay after delivery/reverse charge Assessment against objectives Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection Not estimated    Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 14 of 107 13 Because of the compliance and administrative costs involved with this option, it is likely that a de minimis threshold would still be required. GST would be collected on all goods above the de minimis which, it is expected, could be set at a much lower level than the effective de minimis (where GST is the only duty applying) under the current collection system of $400. Under this option, all goods above the de minimis are liable to GST (unlike option 2). However, because consumers receive their goods before they make payment, the level of compliance could potentially be low. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity A large number of taxpayers would be required to return GST, compared with the status quo and with options 2 and 4 where a relatively small number of offshore suppliers or postal/freight carriers would be required to return the GST. At present, most individuals are not required to file personal income tax returns because their income (for instance, from salary, wages or interest) is withheld at source. Given that a large number of individual taxpayers are not currently required to interact with the tax system by filing tax returns or by directly making payments of tax themselves to Inland Revenue, this option may not be simple for some individuals to comply with. This option could potentially be as simple as paying a parking ticket or a road toll, but compliance may be a major issue. Efficiency of compliance As mentioned above, this option would impose compliance costs on a relatively large group of consumers and for relatively small amounts of GST. Efficiency of administration Administrative costs are also likely to be significant as this option would involve the development of a new system of receiving GST payments. Resources would also need to be allocated to ensuring consumers complied with their tax obligations, by promoting awareness, providing guidance materials and dealing with enquiries, errors and refunds. Fairness and equity The fairness of this option depends on the extent to which consumers comply with the rules, and, where there is non-compliance, whether the penalties are proportionate to the offence. If there is widespread non-compliance, then this option would do little to address the existing fairness issue where domestic retailers are at a competitive disadvantage because of the non-collection of GST on imported goods. Whether consumers would be required to pay GST on gifts they have received from overseas and the fairness implications of requiring them (or not requiring them) to do so would also need to be considered. Sustainability and neutrality If applied consistently and successfully, GST would be returned on both goods provided domestically and from offshore. However, the method of collection would differ significantly depending on whether the supplier was offshore or onshore. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 15 of 107 14 This option would at least not reduce consumers’ access to goods supplied from offshore and would not lead to any revenue-related delays in delivery. However, when this option has been applied in other jurisdictions to tax cross-border services received by consumers, its success has been limited. This is likely due to a number of factors such as lack of awareness of the requirement to return GST given that consumers are accustomed to GST being included in the purchase price, and the potential difficulty of enforcing a reverse charge on such a large taxpayer base. In some cases, the New Zealand purchaser may not realise they are buying from a non- resident supplier. For example, an offshore supplier could have a New Zealand domain name (.co.nz) or a separate chain of New Zealand retail stores. A system could however be put in place where parcels on which GST is required to be paid are identified by Customs at the border and stickers instructing the recipient how to pay the GST are placed on the parcels. Option 4: Post and courier companies collect the GST Assessment against objectives Estimated additional GST collections Competitive neutrality Maintaining consumer welfare Maintaining the current levels of border protection Not estimated    Under this option, tariff revenue and border fees would continue to be collected on low-value goods above a de minimis threshold. GST would be collected on all goods above the de minimis, and it could be lowered at some point in time; however, the magnitude and timing of a potential reduction in the de minimis is not yet clear. Under this option there is expected to be relatively high collection above the de minimis for goods sent through the fast freight stream; however, undervaluation of goods shipped through the postal stream (of which there are a significant number) is rife and, in the medium term, is likely to go undetected due to the lack of advance data for these parcels. However, where goods are identified as requiring payment of duty, compliance by consumers in paying the GST and other duty would be high like it is under the status quo, since the goods are not delivered until payment is made. Assessment against criteria Certainty and simplicity The rules should be simple for couriers to understand and comply with, as they already have systems in place for collecting and remitting the GST to government. However, such a system would not be simple for New Zealand Post to comply with in the medium term. As postal systems do not currently provide for the collection of advance data on imported goods, the postal system cannot yet efficiently implement this option, although there are a number of developments occurring that will allow for this in the future. Therefore, this option would not be likely to lead to increased simplicity and certainty compared with the status quo. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 16 of 107 15 Efficiency of compliance A reduced de minimis under this option would increase administrative costs for couriers, and for New Zealand Post in particular. Post and fast freight would likely collect a similar amount of revenue at a similar cost to the status quo collection mechanism with a lowered de minimis. Therefore, while this option would reduce administration costs for government, these costs would be shifted to courier companies and New Zealand Post. Efficiency of administration Administration costs for Customs would be lower than under the status quo. Fairness and equity The extent to which this option would improve competitive neutrality is dependent on the extent to which the de minimis can be reduced. Sustainability and neutrality If the de minimis could be reduced significantly to a low level, this approach may capture a high proportion of the foregone GST revenue and could therefore go a long way towards addressing the current distortion. However, as stated above, a significant reduction to the de minimis would not be feasible in the medium term. This option is likely to result in further delivery delays for consumers compared with the status quo. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The preferred option is option 2, offshore supplier registration. It is the preferred option because it is a low-cost option for collecting GST on low-value goods (in terms of both administration and compliance costs), and because it meets the objectives of simplicity and certainty, neutrality, effectiveness, fairness and sustainability and is coherent within the overall GST framework. It also follows the international precedent being set by Australia, which Singapore intends to follow and which the EU intends to implement in 2021. The proposed approach would address the problems identified by making offshore suppliers of low- value goods subject to the same GST rules as those that domestic suppliers and offshore suppliers of cross-border services are required to comply with. This would therefore ensure that GST is liable to be charged on imported goods below the current de minimis if the goods are supplied by a supplier who is liable to register. However, the level of compliance could potentially be an issue. Compliance might be better assured under the option where courier companies and New Zealand Post collect duty on goods above a lowered de minimis, as the consumer would not receive the goods until payment is made. However, it is likely that there would be more foregone revenue as a result of undervaluation under this option, compared with option 2. 3 I mplementing this option with a lower de minimis would also be challenging without new technology and systems, including advance data in the postal stream, and it is not certain how much the de minimis could be reduced by and when. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 3 Where GST might not be collected at present as a result of undervaluation by the supplier, this currently foregone GST revenue may be collected under an offshore supplier registration system in cases where an e- marketplace is responsible for returning the GST instead of the underlying supplier.

It is assumed that compliance would be high, based on the experience so far with the GST rules for cross-border services and intangibles. Potentially high upfront systems and low ongoing compliance costs for offshore suppliers above the $60,000 of NZ sales registration threshold Regulators The implementation costs to Inland Revenue are estimated to be up to $460,000. This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low- value goods and other minor systems changes. It also allows for an increase in the volume of work for staff currently processing registrations. Loss of revenue from border fees to Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries Up to $0.46m Approximately $17m in border fees and likely to increase in coming years with the increasing volume of low-value goods. Wider government The government would forego tariff revenue collected on low-value goods and Crown funding would be required for border fees foregone by the Ministry for Primary Industries and Customs. Approximately $5.2m per year and likely to increase in coming years with increasing volume of low-value goods. Other parties Consumers would likely pay more for imported goods that are currently below the de minimis. Some consumers may pay less because of the proposed removal of tariff duty and border fe es. The availability of some goods from overseas may also decrease. $43m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2019/20 fiscal year $64m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2020/21 fiscal year $72m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2021/22 fiscal year $81m of additional GST imposed on NZ consumers for the 2022/23 fiscal year Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 18 of 107 17 Total Monetised Cost Up to $66m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $87m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $95m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Up to $104m for the 2019/20 fiscal year Non-monetised costs Potential lower efficiency of the domestic retail market due to reduction in competitive advantage to offshore suppliers, which may lead to reduced competition from offshore.

Increased competitive neutrality between domestic retailers and offshore suppliers. Unable to estimate Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 19 of 107 18 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Offshore suppliers would be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. This will be a new compliance regime for offshore suppliers. The application of GST to imported goods below the current de minimis may reduce the demand for such goods. A study by UMR Research shows that consumers are price sensitive, particularly at the lower-value end. 4 However, the extent to which the collection of GST on the se goods would reduce consumer demand is likely to be influenced by other factors, such as the domestic availability of the goods. Where the GST-exclusive price of a good (including delivery costs) is the same regardless of whether it is supplied domestically or from offshore, consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase it from the domestic retailer or from the offshore supplier, assuming no difference in quality and delivery times. This is because both suppliers would be required to return GST on the supply of that good if both suppliers are above the registration threshold (which, due to the proposed inclusion of marketplace rules, is likely to be the case in most instances). The removal of tariff and cost recovery charges on some goods and faster processing times may increase demand for goods valued between $400 and $1,000. The preferred strategy, as with the rest of the New Zealand tax system, is to rely primarily on voluntary compliance. It is however recognised that some consumers may be incentivised to buy from suppliers who do not charge GST on their purchases. Some suppliers may try to avoid detection as being liable to register by shifting their method of transporting their goods from freight to the postal system where the quality of parcel data is much poorer than in the fast freight stream. 4 http://www.customs.govt.nz/news/resources/legal/Documents/UMR-Report-NZ-Customs-consumer- motivation-for-purchases-of-low-value-goods.pdf Total Monetised Benefit $43m for the 2019/20 fiscal year $64m for the 2020/21 fiscal year $72m for the 2021/22 fiscal year $81m for the 2022/23 fiscal year Non-monetised benefits Medium Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 20 of 107 19 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Meetings with some stakeholders, including New Zealand Post, the Conference of Asia Pacific Express Carries (CAPEC 5 ), Consumer NZ and Retail NZ have been held. At the time of drafting this Regulatory Impact Assessment, these stakeholders a re not aware of the upcoming release of a discussion document proposing an offshore supplier registration system. CAPEC and New Zealand Post have not been consulted specifically on the analysis and the proposed approach. However, they have flagged their opposition to immediately lowering the de minimis under the status quo. Retail industry groups such as Booksellers NZ and Retail NZ are in favour of an offshore supplier registration system , however the proposed waiver of tariffs and border clearance levies may influence their position. Officials also met with representatives from a technology company in July 2017 which has developed a system that could be used for collecting GST from consumers after the delivery of the goods. This company is therefore in favour of the pay after delivery/reverse charge option. Offshore suppliers of low-value goods and domestic consumers have not been consulted yet. Their views about the analysis of the problem and proposed option will be sought through the submission process for the discussion document. 5 An industry body representing four courier companies – DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 21 of 107 20 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposed option will require legislative change and would be largely based on the system that has applied to cross-border services and intangibles since 1 October 2016. The option will also require regulatory changes to the current border management arrangements. This will be considered as part of final policy decisions, and will be considered further in a later Regulatory Impact Assessment. Subject to consultation and final policy decisions, the proposal is likely to come into effect in 2019 which is expected to provide sufficient preparation time for offshore suppliers. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 22 of 107 21 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. This will be considered further in a later Regulatory Impact Statement after final policy decisions have been made. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme.

Why is Government intervention required? The Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). The problem under consideration is how to implement the proposed system in a way that imposes as little deadweight cost as possible on the parties involved and in the least distortionary way possible, while also maximising voluntary compliance. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The taxing point for imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is proposed to be the point of sale (as opposed to being at the border, as is presently the case for consignments between the Customs de minimis 1 and $1,000). This means that non-resident suppliers (as well as electronic marketplaces and “re-deliverers”) 2 would be required to register for, collect, return and remit GST on their sales of goods valued at or below $1,000. This is considered to be the most feasible and cost-effective collection option at this time. Requiring offshore suppliers to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. The reason for this preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on making the rules as simple as possible for the parties involved in order to minimise aggregate compliance costs. 1 The Customs de minimis is defined as the minimum amount of “duty” collectable (which includes GST), as opposed to the maximum value of a consignment on which duty is not collected. The de minimis is $60, meaning that if the amount of GST and duties on a consignment is less than $60, revenue and cost recovery charges are not collected on that consignment. 2 An electronic marketplace, such as a website, app or internet portal, is commonly used by sellers to market and sell their products to buyers. Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier of the goods (or the marketplace) does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The most common scenario is that the goods are instead shipped to an overseas mailbox from which the re-deliverer collects the goods and ships them to New Zealand, but the re-deliverer definition would also include businesses providing personal shopper services. 2. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 25 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 2 Customs prefers an approach whereby offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $400. Under Customs’ preferred approach, Customs would continue to collect GST and other charges on imported consignments valued above $400. Customs prefers this approach because it is estimated to collect $303 million of additional GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold. The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under a $1,000 threshold, and Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: • Government: The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST, estimated to be $66 million for the 2019/20 fiscal year (assuming a 1 October 2019 application date). However the Government may incur a fiscal cost of approximately $17.795 million per annum (based on the 2017/18 year) in replacing funding for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) that is currently cost-recovered by the two agencies under existing arrangements, depending on final decisions. The Government would also forgo tariffs (of up to $3.2 million per annum based on the 2017/18 year) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. • Domestic retailers: Collecting GST on low-value imported goods may in some cases help to improve New Zealand-based retailers’ ability to compete with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. • Fast freight: Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This is expected to generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. • New Zealand Post: Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. • Consumers: While consumers as a whole are unambiguously worse off, some consumers would benefit from the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from imported consignments between the de minimis and $1,000. • Businesses importing low-value goods: Businesses that import low-value consignments would also benefit from the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 26 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 3 Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Consumers: Consumers would pay GST on imported goods valued at less than $400 which they previously would not have paid any GST or duties on under the current border collection system. Suppliers’ compliance costs may also be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices (over and above the amount of the tax itself). There is also a risk that consumer choice may be adversely affected if suppliers cease to offer shipping of goods to delivery addresses in New Zealand. Consumers may also experience delays in receiving goods if Customs and MPI require increased physical inspections as a consequence of a potential decrease in the reliability of information provided to Customs for border and biosecurity risk assessment. • Suppliers (including electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers): Suppliers meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of making the necessary systems changes and implementing new processes, registering, filing GST returns and remitting the GST to Inland Revenue. Suppliers selling through electronic marketplaces would not be required to register and return GST to Inland Revenue if their non-marketplace sales to New Zealand consumers are less than $60,000, as the operator of the electronic marketplace would be the entity responsible for registering and returning GST on sales made by third parties through its marketplace. In these situations, the marketplace operator may pass its compliance costs on to the underlying suppliers. • New Zealand-based manufacturers: Footwear and clothing manufacturers may be adversely affected by the removal of tariffs on imported footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold (given that the few remaining tariffs are mostly on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries). However, these industries have already had to adapt to the increasing non-collection of tariffs, as the phased implementation of New Zealand’s free trade agreements mean that the amount of tariffs that would otherwise be collected if no action is taken would be decreasing over time anyway. • Customs and MPI: Cost recovery charges 3 which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk management activities at the border would be forgone on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. This would exacerbate an existing funding shortfall for Customs and MPI until a new cost recovery regime is put in place, unless Crown funding is provided to replace the lost cost-recovered funding. Customs and MPI may also incur costs should the quality of data associated with entries diminish resulting in increased physical inspection of goods. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Risk of suppliers and electronic marketplaces ceasing to offer shipping to New Zealand delivery addresses: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non-resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may 3 The Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 27 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 4 not continue to ship goods to New Zealand delivery addresses. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 4 The inclusion of rules that impose the liability to register for and return GST on operators of electronic marketplaces in respect of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers by non-resident suppliers should help to mitigate the risk of smaller suppliers ceasing to ship to New Zealand, as many of these suppliers would be selling to New Zealand through an electronic marketplace. Officials’ preferred options that are outlined in this Regulatory Impact Assessment include measures that are intended to simplify the requirements for non-resident suppliers, operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers as much as possible, which should help to reduce this risk. • Competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses: There is a risk that the addition of GST to the prices of goods offered to consumers by compliant businesses may result in a competitive advantage for other businesses that would not be required to register and return GST (or that would not comply with the rules if liable to register). The inclusion of rules that would deem operators of electronic marketplaces to be the suppliers of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces by non-residents should help to minimise this risk by improving compliance with the rules. This would however result in GST being collected on goods supplied by non-residents that would not otherwise be required to be returned if these suppliers sold goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website. It is a possibility that this may potentially create a competitive disadvantage for compliant marketplace operators. However, this risk is not thought to be significant given the market dominance of the large electronic marketplaces. • Quality of import entry information for biosecurity and border risk assessment: The preferred option may reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information (as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments below $1,000), which may have adverse consequences for the management of biosecurity and other border risks. Customs and MPI will monitor any impacts on the management of border and biosecurity risks. • Undervaluation of goods by suppliers or importers for Customs purposes: Compared with the existing de minimis, a $1,000 threshold may exacerbate the existing issue of undervaluation in relation to high-value consignments. This may not have a significant impact on net GST collections on imported consignments valued above $1,000 (as the vast majority of imported goods above $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses), but this could have adverse implications for the collection of tariffs and 4 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 28 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 5 cost recovery charges on high-value consignments. • Potential behavioural changes by consumers: Compared with the existing de minimis, the $1,000 threshold may also incentivise consumers to purchase goods valued between $400 and $1,000 free of GST/VAT from offshore retailers that would be below the registration threshold. It is difficult to say how significant this risk may be, since it is expected that many larger offshore retailers that ship goods to New Zealand would be above the registration threshold, and it is unclear how many smaller offshore suppliers below the registration threshold would sell goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website or mail order. Consumers may also be incentivised to arrange for friends or family members in foreign countries to buy goods for them and reimburse the friend or family member. However, whether this would necessarily be cost-effective is uncertain, as it is likely to be the case that the consumer would end up paying foreign VAT, GST or sales tax if they arrange for a friend or family member to buy the goods and ship the goods to them. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Analysing the impact of the proposals on offshore suppliers has been constrained by the lack of data and information available. Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using retail banking data for the 2017/18 fiscal year supplied by Datamine. Online transactions were identified using a range of methods, including by identifying whether a card was present for a transaction and isolating transactions with known e-commerce only retailers. To exclude services and intangibles and the likes of tax payments, only transactions with merchant category codes clearly related to goods retail were included. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The Treasury, Inland Revenue Department and New Zealand Customs Quality Assurance Assessment: A joint panel from The Treasury, Inland Revenue and Customs considers that the Regulatory Impact Assessment partially meets the quality criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIS could probably be clearer and more concise, particularly as to the nature and implications of the agency disagreement as to the value threshold below which offshore Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 29 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 6 suppliers would be required to collect GST. However, it seems unlikely that this would make the decision itself any more clear-cut, since the adoption of either threshold will entail downsides as well as upsides. It is also evident that consumer and supplier behaviour will be a major driver of the outcome in practice, particularly in terms of revenue collected. It will therefore be important, as set out in the RIS, to collect data and information from different sources, including experience in other jurisdictions, to inform ongoing monitoring and possibly review of the new approach. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 30 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 7 Impact Statement: GST on low-value imported goods Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service are responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 31 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 8 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints on the analysis are as follows: • Range of options considered: The Government has already made a decision that it intends to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). Options considered are therefore focussed on the key design settings for that particular collection model (as opposed to considering alternative collection models), including the level of the low-value goods threshold. • Evidence of the problem: There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the forgone GST revenue. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine suggests a potential forgone revenue figure on imported goods below the de minimis for the 2017/18 fiscal year of approximately $130 million, which is assumed to be growing at a rate of around 11.9 percent each year. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers may register and comply under the preferred option. A crude estimate may be obtained by reference to the number of entities that have registered under Australia’s new GST legislation (which is based on essentially the same collection model). However, registrations are continuing to be processed in Australia, which means that the eventual number of registrants in Australia may be significantly more than the 721 entities that had registered as of 10 July 2018. While there is data on how much GST is collected by Customs on imported goods, it is not possible to determine the net amount of GST collected on imported goods as many consignments are imported by GST-registered businesses that are able to claim the GST back from Inland Revenue. This means the potential fiscal risk of increasing the threshold above which GST is collected on consignments at the border and below which non-resident suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re- deliverers are responsible for returning GST cannot be precisely quantified. • Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: The Government’s proposed approach is estimated to increase GST revenue by approximately $66 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, increasing to $100 million and $112 million in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 fiscal years respectively. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast is that it assumes static behaviour on the part of both suppliers and consumers. However, the imposition of GST on low-value imported goods may decrease consumers’ propensity to buy goods from offshore, and may also decrease suppliers’ willingness to ship goods to New Zealand, further increasing costs of importing goods for consumers. Another key limitation is that the revenue forecast assumes for simplicity a 100 percent collection rate under the existing border collection system in relation to consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. The limitation of this assumption is that it is clear that undervaluation by suppliers is an issue to some extent, but the exact scale of the problem and the amount of GST forgone as a result are unknown. • Time constraints: Ministers have decided to plan for the introduction of the proposed rules on 1 October 2019. The proposals are therefore required to be included in a bill introduced before the end of 2018 to give affected businesses sufficient certainty about how the rules will operate.

Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant (retail banking data supplied by Datamine indicates that New Zealand consumers spent approximately $870 million online on goods from offshore suppliers in 2017/18). The implication of this is that domestic businesses may be at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also means that the Government is forgoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand, and this forgone revenue is increasing over time. Based on a seven-year average, the number of imported consignments valued below $400 is growing at about 17 percent per annum. In response to these issues, the Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Border collection system GST is currently collected by the New Zealand Customs Service on imported consignments on which at least $60 of “duty” (including GST) is collectable. In practice this means that GST is not collected on imported consignments with a value below $400 (including freight and insurance) if GST is the only duty owing (which is typically the case). However, where the goods are subject to tariffs, the insurance and freight-inclusive value of the goods may be as low as $226, depending on the applicable tariff rate and the amount of international freight and insurance charges. 5 Customs’ and MPI’s border risk and biosecurity activities are funded by the collection of cost recovery charges on imported consignments above the de minimis. Work to date has shown that a substantial reduction in the current de minimis (from $60 of duty) is not feasible in the short term as the marginal costs of collection under the existing system would outweigh the additional revenue collected. The extent to which the de minimis may eventually be reduced in a cost-effective way under the current system or under a model where fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post collect the GST is also uncertain, as is the likely timing of such a reduction in the de minimis. Other interested agencies (from a trade, competition or consumer affairs standpoint) are the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), who were all consulted during the process of drafting this Regulatory 5 This consignment value of $226 assumes that the applicable tariff rate is the maximum 10 percent rate and that there are no clearly separable freight and insurance charges. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 34 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 11 Impact Assessment. Offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on remote services The preferred option builds upon the existing system that has been successfully implemented since 1 October 2016 for the collection of GST on cross-border supplies of “remote” services, including supplies of digital services and intangibles such as streaming services and software. At the time of designing the rules, policy officials had conservatively estimated the total forgone GST revenue to be around $40 million and that around 100 businesses might register. Since implementation, the rules have been performing better than initial expectations, with $131 million in revenue being collected under these rules for the 2017/18 tax year (the year covering 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018) with over 200 businesses registered to date. This more than favourably compares with other jurisdictions’ experience with implementing similar rules for the collection of consumption taxes on cross-border services and intangibles. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST as a broad-based consumption tax should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods. This helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple, as opposed to being a tax that distorts competition by creating biases in consumers’ or businesses’ behaviour or which collects little revenue by only collecting on a narrow tax base. At present, GST is collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis 6 and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether or not tariffs are payable. The non- collection of GST is problematic because the growth in online purchases from offshore suppliers means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is large and growing, and so is the amount of forgone revenue. Forgone revenue Estimates of the forgone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated a ‘maximum potential’ forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $140 million per annum using credit card data. Officials did further work in 2016 using a mixed dataset including Customs sample data on import values, as well as data on volumes from New Zealand Post and fast freight carriers and Australian estimates of the split between business and consumer purchases. This work indicated a lower potential forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. More recently, Inland Revenue has estimated using retail banking data that approximately $130 million in GST revenue was forgone in 2017. This more recent figure is considered to be more robust than previous estimates, as the use of merchant category codes and proxies for identifying online-only transactions should mean that the dataset roughly consists only of online purchases of goods from offshore suppliers. A limitation of the 2015 estimate is that an assumption had to be made about the split between spending on goods versus spending on services and intangibles. The main limitation of the 6 The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 35 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 12 2017 estimate (based on a mixed dataset including Customs’ sample data) is that its reliance on declared values may produce an estimate that is lower than the actual forgone revenue, as suppliers may be incentivised under the current system to under-declare values. The growth in direct consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount of forgone GST is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value of goods imported below the de minimis is 11.9 percent per year 7 , the amount of forgone GST is forecasted to grow to $183 million by 2021 if no action is taken. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as there are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The following options were considered and ruled out by ministers: • Collection between the point of sale and delivery by transporters: fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post would collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on goods above a lowered de minimis (“extended status quo” or “transporter model”). • Collection after delivery: consumers would pay GST directly to the government after delivery of the goods (“pay after delivery” or a “consumer reverse charge”). These options were also considered by officials in a previous Regulatory Impact Assessment in July 2017 and by the Tax Working Group (the TWG). The TWG recommended that the Government implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low- value imported goods, noting that practical concerns with options to collect GST between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery mean these two options may not be feasible in the short term. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered an option where financial intermediaries, such as credit card companies and other payment processing intermediaries, would be responsible for remitting GST on online purchases of low-value imported goods. This option was considered to be unlikely to be feasible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to precisely determine in all cases whether the payment was for goods or services (or both), or whether the goods or services were purchased while the consumer was overseas. Another limitation is that where the payment for the goods is made to a New Zealand-based entity (such as a resident marketplace), there would not be sufficient information about whether the underlying supplier of the goods is based offshore or not. Interdependencies with ongoing work Customs’ border risk management and MPI’s current biosecurity processes are reliant on 7 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 17%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 36 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 13 information about the content of low-value goods. For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Import entry data are used by MPI and Customs to risk-assess consignments at the border. This means that these existing information requirements would need to remain in place under the preferred option, even though this information would not be used for the collection of GST or tariff duty on low-value imported goods. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and MPI, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border) from imported consignments with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs is currently reviewing its cost recovery arrangement and will report back on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding in the context of that review. MPI expects to report to Cabinet on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding at the time of final policy decisions by Cabinet on the GST on low-value imported goods proposals. Both MFAT and MBIE carry out work which has implications for New Zealand’s tariff policy. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 37 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 14 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are consumers, non-resident suppliers of low-value goods, operators of electronic marketplaces, re-deliverers, the fast freight industry and customs brokers, New Zealand Post, domestic retailers, tax advisors and domestic clothing and footwear manufacturers. A government discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system was released in May 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 32 submissions in response to the discussion document. A further 49 submissions to the Tax Working Group that mentioned the GST on low-value imported goods issue were also forwarded to Inland Revenue officials to consider. The submissions received were from private sector tax advisors, goods transporters and customs brokers, New Zealand business groups, electronic marketplaces and a number of private individuals. Most submissions were generally favourable at a high level of the proposed offshore supplier registration system. However, some submissions indicated a preference for a different collection model to the one proposed in the discussion document, or otherwise stated that other collection models should be given further consideration before being discounted. A couple of submissions from tax advisors considered that the proposed offshore supplier registration system may only be an interim step until technological advancements make an alternative collection model feasible. The New Zealand retail industry groups that made submissions on the discussion document agreed with the analysis of the problem presented in the discussion document and were strongly in favour of the proposed solution. New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers were also broadly supportive of the proposed approach but expressed some concerns about the finer details of how the system would be implemented, particularly in relation to the lack of detail provided in the discussion document as to how the proposals would interact with customs processes at the border and any potential changes to these processes. Most private individuals (the bulk of whom submitted to the TWG rather than on the discussion document) supported the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. However, as most of these submissions were made to the TWG prior to the release of the discussion document, these submissions tended not to comment on any specific details of the proposals, such as the proposed collection model. A small number of submissions (including those on the discussion document and to the TWG) from private individuals were opposed to the collection of GST on low-value imported goods regardless of the collection model. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 38 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 15 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options analysed in section 5 consist of the following packages of key design options: • Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (with some gap-filling design options added in for where the discussion document was silent on a specific design detail). • Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400. • Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (status quo option) In April 2018, Cabinet decided to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 and to release a government discussion document to consult on the design details of the proposed system (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). This option reflects the package of design features that were proposed in the government discussion document released for public consultation in May 2018. Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would only apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $400 or less. 8 Goods would be covered by the proposed regime where either the actual supplier of the goods (or the supplier for GST purposes if not the same person) arranges, assists or facilitates the delivery of the goods to a New Zealand address. 9 Supplies to GST-registered businesses would be excluded from the scope of the rules. Rules for determining whether the supply is made to a consumer or to a GST-registered business would apply. However, where GST is charged on a supply to a GST-registered business, the supplier would be allowed to issue the recipient with a tax invoice (thus allowing the GST- registered recipient to claim a deduction for the GST in its GST return), provided that the value of the supply does not exceed $1,000 – otherwise the supplier would be required to 8 The calculation of the customs value is set out in Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. In the case of low-value imported goods, the customs value would generally be the transaction value of the goods (being the price paid or payable when they are sold for export to New Zealand), subject to a number of adjustments including deductions for the costs of transportation, insurance and other charges and expenses related to the handling and transportation of the goods from the time they have left the country of export. For the purposes of determining whether GST applies at the point of sale, a supplier would be able to self- assess the customs value using a reasonable estimate as at the time of supply, rather than being required to determine it strictly in accordance with schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act. 9 The discussion document was silent on whether or not this $400 threshold would be based on the customs value or the freight and insurance-inclusive value of the goods. Basing the threshold on the customs value of the goods has been chosen on the basis of feedback received in submissions. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 39 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 16 provide a refund of the GST. Non-resident suppliers would be required to register for GST and collect and return GST on goods that have a customs value of $400 or less if their taxable supplies of goods and services exceed (or are expected to exceed) $60,000 in a given 12-month period. However, where low-value goods are sold through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier of the goods for GST purposes and would therefore have the responsibility for registering and returning GST. Suppliers that only sell through GST-registered electronic marketplaces (or who make less than $60,000 in taxable supplies outside of a GST-registered electronic marketplace) would not be required to register. A re-deliverer would only be deemed to be the supplier of low-value goods imported by a consumer if neither the supplier nor an operator of an electronic marketplace assists in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $400 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $400. Double taxation (where both the supplier and Customs collect GST) may arise when multiple low-value goods are sent in a single consignment valued above $400, or if low-value goods are sent in a consignment with goods valued above $400. Double taxation could also arise where the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply differed from that used by Customs at the time of importation. The supplier would be required to issue a receipt to a New Zealand consumer in relation to a supply of low-value imported goods. The receipt would be required to include the name and GST registration number of the supplier, the date of issue and a description of the goods supplied. If GST has been charged on all of the goods, the receipt should show the amount paid for the supply along with a statement that this includes GST, or alternatively, the receipt could identify the GST charged for each of the goods separately. If GST has been charged on only some of the goods (for instance if some are valued above $400), the receipt should include information showing whether GST has been charged on each of the goods. Monetary amounts detailed on the receipt would not need to be in New Zealand dollars. To prevent Customs from collecting GST on the importation of the goods, the consumer would provide their receipt to Customs when asked by Customs to pay the GST. Where double taxation does arise, the supplier would be responsible for providing the consumer with a refund of the GST. 10 Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST 10 The discussion document was silent on who would provide a refund. Placing the responsibility for providing refunds on the supplier is included as one of the design options here as it is officials’ preferred option in relation to who is responsible for providing refunds. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 40 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 17 Operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers need to use information from either underlying suppliers or consumers to determine the GST treatment of supplies. A marketplace operator would need to have information about the residency of an underlying supplier, as the proposed marketplace rules only apply to supplies made by non-resident underlying suppliers. Re-deliverers would rely on information provided by consumers about the value of the goods. Marketplace operators and re-deliverers would still be liable for GST and any associated interest or penalties in situations where the supplier or consumer provides incorrect or misleading information which results in a GST shortfall. Operators of electronic marketplaces would also be liable for GST on goods sold by non- resident suppliers through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers in situations where: • The payment for the goods is made directly to the supplier instead of to the marketplace operator, or when there is not a split payment mechanism allowing the amount of the GST to be remitted by the payment processor to the marketplace operator; and • The supplier defaults on paying the amount of the GST to the marketplace operator. Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Scope of the rules and registration requirements With the exception of two additions, the design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules are the same as those described under option one. To reduce compliance costs for some suppliers (including re-deliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces), these businesses would be able to charge GST on goods valued above $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers if: • The supplier (or deemed supplier) self-assesses that their total sales of goods individually valued above $400 are no more than 5 percent of the value of their total supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers; or • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to allow a supplier not meeting the above 5 percent test to charge GST on goods valued above $400. 11 To reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses, suppliers would also be able to agree with the Commissioner on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is made to a GST- registered person. This could apply in situations where the nature of the supply or the total value of the supply is such that it would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered business. For example, if the supply is of a large number of low-value imported goods (for 11 The proposed discretion could cover circumstances where the 5 percent test is not met due to a minor or one- off discrepancy, where it is too difficult for the supplier to determine precisely whether or not their supplies of goods above the threshold to consumers are less than 5 percent of their total sales of goods to consumers (but it is likely to be the case that they would be less than 5 percent) and the Commissioner is satisfied that the supplier represents a low compliance risk. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 41 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 18 instance, hundreds of t-shirts or hundreds of hard copies of a book), either the nature or the value of the supply (or both) would likely indicate that the customer is not a consumer. The design features relating to registration requirements are the same as in option one. Interaction with border collection system Aside from one addition relating to the prevention of double taxation, the design features for how the proposed offshore supplier registration system would interact with the existing border collection system are the same as those described under option one. The supplier would be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents. 12 The supplier could do this by providing the fast freight carrier with a copy of the receipt described under option one, or by instructing the person that undertakes the fulfilment of the goods to do so. If the value of the consignment is above the low-value goods threshold, the fast freight carrier or customs broker would include the supplier’s GST registration number and information about which goods had GST collected by the supplier on the Customs documentation. If this information is included on Customs documents then Customs will only collect GST on the items in the consignment on which GST was not collected at the point of sale. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The Commissioner would be provided with the ability to prescribe or agree to a method for a marketplace operator or a re-deliverer to make conclusions relevant to whether they are the deemed supplier of low-value goods and the amount of GST that is payable. When exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would take into account the commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator and the reliability of this information, the compliance costs of the marketplace operator and the mechanisms the marketplace operator has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. Where the marketplace operator or re-deliverer has a safe harbour agreement, they would not be liable for additional GST if they have relied on incorrect information and as a result have underpaid GST. If this happens, the underlying supplier or consumer may be required to register and pay the GST instead. Operators of electronic marketplaces would be able to claim a bad debt deduction in circumstances where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator, provided the marketplace’s commission or facilitation fee was also not collected. Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 (Ministers’ proposed option) Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would generally apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $1,000 or less. With the exception of the change in 12 At present this would only be feasible where goods are being delivered by fast freight, as there is currently insufficient electronic data on parcels sent through the international postal system. Hence this would not be a requirement where goods are sent to New Zealand by post. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 42 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 19 the proposed low-value goods threshold from $400 to $1,000, the other design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules and registration requirements would be the same as those described under option two. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $1,000 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $1,000. The design features for the prevention of double taxation are the same as those under option two, as is the process for GST refunds where double taxation does arise. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The design features for marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST (where the supplier or consumer provided incorrect or misleading information or where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator) are the same as those in option two. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for businesses and consumers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: A dministrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as possible. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The preferred option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the forgone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about, without unduly restricting trade and consumer choice or creating new distortions. Counteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. Efficiency of compliance, sustainability and neutrality and fairness and equity are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading off increased administration costs for gains in these three areas. The certainty and simplicity criterion would generally be positively correlated with the efficiency of compliance criterion, in that the more certain and simple the rules are, the lower compliance costs should be. However, there are some instances where increased simplicity and certainty for one group may come at the cost of increased uncertainty or complexity for another group. There may also be instances where having more flexible as opposed to prescriptive rules makes the rules simpler for some parties (and thus reduces their Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 43 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 20 compliance costs) but results in the rules being more complex or less certain for other parties. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No low-value goods threshold An option where offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to charge GST on all supplies of imported goods to New Zealand consumers ( with or without GST collection at the border by Customs on consignments above a certain value) was ruled out. This option was discounted because of concerns about the potential revenue risks involved with replacing the existing collection of GST at the border on high-value consignments with collection at the point of sale by offshore suppliers, being that offshore suppliers may not return the GST that they had collected (or had purported to have collected on the customs documentation). Defining the low-value goods threshold with reference to the value of the transaction Defining the low-value goods threshold in terms of the value of the total transaction, as opposed to the value of an individual good, was also ruled out. This is because multiple low- value goods could be sold together in the same transaction with a total value in excess of the low-value goods threshold. Non-taxation would therefore arise where the goods were shipped separately in multiple consignments each valued below the low-value goods threshold, thus creating an avoidance opportunity. Preventing double taxation The discussion document asked for submissions on whether a reasonable belief exception similar to that legislated in Australia may be an appropriate way to avoid double taxation. Under a reasonable belief exception, the supplier would not charge GST on a supply of low- value goods if it had a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together in a single consignment with a total value above the low-value goods threshold. A reasonable belief exception was ultimately ruled out on the basis that it would likely be only very rarely used by suppliers, based on the experience so far in Australia. It may also be potentially quite subjective, which could create difficulties for suppliers pose and potentially pose an integrity risk. Refunds where double taxation arises Options where either Customs or Inland Revenue would be responsible for providing GST refunds to consumers where double taxation arises were considered and ultimately ruled out. This is mostly because having Customs provide refunds would be disproportionately costly and would likely be difficult for consumers (at present the provision of one refund takes two hours of staff time). Given that the instances of double taxation should be rare, having Inland Revenue set up an entirely new process is likely to also be disproportionately costly. It would also not be intuitive for consumers to approach Inland Revenue for a refund (being a party that they had not otherwise had any interaction with in relation to the transaction). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 44 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 21 It is expected that placing the responsibility for providing refunds on suppliers would provide suppliers with more incentive to take reasonable steps to prevent double taxation. Business-to-business supplies Options where offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST in respect of business-to-business supplies or where suppliers would have the option of charging GST on business-to-business supplies valued above $1,000 were ruled out owing to the revenue risks associated with high-value supplies, which naturally pose a greater fraud risk. 13 Electronic marketplaces A “pure” vendor collection model (where the only persons that would have a liability to register and return GST would be suppliers that have legal title over the goods sold to consumers) was not considered. Officials consider that the level of compliance with a pure vendor collection model would not be likely to be good enough to warrant serious consideration of such a model, as it is expected that a large proportion of revenue would continue to be forgone while also meaning that there would not be a level playing field for suppliers that do comply. A joint and several liability model, similar to the one introduced in the United Kingdom for tackling non-compliance by suppliers selling through online marketplaces, was not given much consideration primarily because it is similar to the rebuttable presumption model described below, and hence there are similar concerns with it in relation to compliance costs, enforcement and administration costs. Consideration was given to two exceptions to the “deemed supplier” approach behind the proposed marketplace rules: • Rebuttable presumption model: The default position would be that the marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier, but this presumption of liability can be rebutted if the marketplace agrees to meet the requirements of a “recognised marketplace”. A recognised marketplace would be required to provide Inland Revenue with information about their underlying suppliers, including their trading names, contact details and the total value of supplies of low-value goods that each of their underlying suppliers is making through the marketplace to New Zealand consumers. A recognised marketplace would also endeavour to ensure that liable suppliers have registered and are returning the GST on supplies made to New Zealand consumers, and would be required to block suppliers that are continuously non-compliant from selling to New Zealand where the marketplace is aware or should be aware of this non-compliance. For low-level compliance with their responsibilities, a recognised marketplace would be subject to warnings, ultimately leading to monetary penalties. For significant or ongoing non-compliance the marketplace would lose its “recognised” status even if, despite its best efforts to ensure compliance from suppliers, the suppliers selling through the marketplace are largely non-compliant. 13 Although the goods covered by the proposals are by definition of a low value, multiple low-value goods may nevertheless be supplied together as a single high-value supply. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 45 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 22 • Commissioner discretion: The Commissioner would have a discretion to allow a given electronic marketplace to not have the responsibility for registering and returning GST in respect of goods sold through its platform. This discretion would apply where the Commissioner considers the marketplace has a compelling case that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with the deemed supplier requirements. These two options were ultimately ruled out for the following reasons: The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion if exercised) would shift compliance costs to underlying suppliers. Aggregate compliance costs are therefore likely to be higher as a result of there being more collection entities, some of whom may have less sophisticated systems and may not be as well-resourced. The model would rely on ongoing commitment of resources by Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces to continually educate suppliers and enforce compliance. It is questionable that these responsibilities and the information requirements for recognised marketplaces would be less onerous than their obligations under the deemed supplier model. Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces would also need to deal with the risk of underlying suppliers continually creating new identities to avoid GST. If compliance is perceived to be low, this may reduce the willingness of other suppliers to comply. It would be difficult to assess the point at which the recognised marketplace would need to revert to being deemed to be the supplier for GST purposes where there is persistent non- compliance by underlying suppliers. Compliant underlying suppliers may be disrupted by potential deregistration. The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion option) would create uncertainty for electronic marketplaces and underlying suppliers in the lead-up to the implementation date, as it may take a considerable amount of time to reach an agreement with the Commissioner (or for the Commissioner to reach a conclusion as to whether her discretion should be exercised). Given the relatively short lead-in time from the intended legislative enactment date and 1 October 2019, it is desirable that all parties have certainty about their obligations so that they can make adequate preparations to comply. The use of the Commissioner’s discretion would be likely to distort competition between electronic marketplaces. There may also be risks that the Commissioner may be perceived as applying the discretion unfairly where it is available only to some electronic marketplaces, which would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the tax system. It may be difficult for the Commissioner to apply the discretion consistently and assess whether the marketplaces are capable of collecting GST. It may be especially difficult for the Commissioner to respond to assertions that a marketplace may withdraw from the New Zealand market if the discretion is not applied. Many of the prominent electronic marketplaces would already be registered in Australia under their equivalent legislation. In many cases the systems already implemented by these marketplaces for Australia could be extended to comply with New Zealand’s rules, as the rules would be broadly similar. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 46 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 23 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Option one Status quo (Design options proposed in the government discussion document) Option two Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Option three Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 Certainty and simplicity 0 + The addition of simplifying design details post-consultation should simplify compliance for suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers compared with option one. ++ Suppliers that only sell goods valued at or below $1,000 or who fall into the 5 percent rule as a result of the $1,000 threshold can charge GST on all of their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than being required to distinguish between goods valued below or above the threshold. Greater price transparency for consumers compared with options one and two as GST is charged at the point of sale and tariffs and cost recovery charges are removed from imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Efficiency of compliance 0 + Some compliance cost savings compared with option one. + This option is expected to have the least compliance costs overall compared with the other options owing to the $1,000 threshold. Efficiency of administration 0 + Some administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to preventing double taxation, owing to the requirement for suppliers to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents where goods are delivered by fast freight. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under option one. + Administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to the prevention of double taxation. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under options one and two. Fairness and equity 0 + Reduced compliance costs for suppliers and consumers, including reduced potential for double taxation (since the supplier would be required to provide a refund if double taxation occurs). + More suppliers are likely to be liable to register under this option, increasing the coverage of imported goods that are subject to GST compared with options one and two. Reduced potential for double taxation owing to $1,000 threshold and the proposed mechanisms for preventing double taxation. There is however less fairness for retailers importing consignments valued above $1,000 that are subject to tariffs compared with options one and two (up to $2.6m Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 47 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 24 more in tariffs p.a. would be forgone). Sustainability and neutrality 0 + Estimated GST collections are the same as under option one. However, the reduction in compliance costs for suppliers compared with option one may mean that less suppliers cease to ship to New Zealand or refuse to comply. ++ Estimated to collect $25m less in GST over the forecast period than options one and two. However, this option is considered to be the most sustainable over the longer term, as it is considered that it may result in a better compliance outcome than options one and two whilst minimising the number of suppliers that cease shipping to New Zealand (and therefore may actually result in more GST being collected). Approx. $14.9m p.a. in cost recovery charges for Customs and MPI would be forgone compared with options and two. Any resulting funding shortfall may have to be funded through a changed cost recovery structure or through replacement Crown funding. Overall assessment 0 + This option is an improvement over option one with respect to all of the considerations. ++ Sustainability and neutrality and efficiency of compliance outweigh the other considerations. This option is an improvement over option two with respect to most of the other considerations and is therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred option. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 48 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 25 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue officials consider the preferred option is Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Customs officials prefer Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $400. The reason for Inland Revenue’s preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on the efficiency of compliance criterion (in particular the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and electronic marketplaces, as well as the freight and logistics industry). It is acknowledged that the additional benefits to offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and the freight and logistics industry of the $1,000 threshold compared with a threshold of $400 cannot be valued with certainty, whereas the estimated impacts on the government’s financial position are better understood. There is also uncertainty in predicting possible unintended behavioural changes by consumers (as well as other importers and their agents) as a result of a $1,000 threshold. To mitigate these factors and their associated risks, specific monitoring of implementation and compliance will be established, and a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold will be conducted after three years. Customs’ preference is for a low-value goods threshold of $400 (as in options one and two), as this is estimated to collect $303 million of GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold (option three). The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under option three, and Customs and MPI would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Trade, competition and consumer choice issues Some private submitters expressed concerns that consumers’ access to goods from offshore may be significantly reduced as a consequence of the proposals if they go ahead. These sentiments were echoed by Business NZ and KPMG, who while being broadly supportive of the proposals noted that there is a risk that implementation of the policy will affect consumer choice and trade. Business NZ warned against making the rules overly complicated, noting that a pragmatic and reasonable approach is needed to ensure the impacts on trade, competition and consumer choice are minimal. It was also pointed out there could be reciprocal problems for New Zealand exporters if New Zealand is perceived to be a country to avoid selling to. Private submitters expressing concerns about possible adverse impacts on consumer choice tended to disagree with the analysis of the problem or expressed some reservations about it. In particular, these submitters pointed out that many goods that are being imported by consumers cannot be purchased from New Zealand retailers – or, where they can be purchased domestically, the price difference compared with an overseas supplier tends to be significantly more than 15%. Two submitters expressed Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 49 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 26 particular concern in relation to clothing and shoes in less common sizes that they could not easily source from domestic retailers and stated that they have little other choice than to purchase these goods from overseas suppliers. A submission from an industry group representing three electronic marketplaces stated that the extraterritorial application of GST will create additional costs for overseas businesses which would serve as a barrier to trade. They considered this to be contrary to both New Zealand’s advocacy for free trade and the spirit of various free trade agreements. They stated that the policy risks reciprocation by other governments on New Zealand exporters, which could stifle entrepreneurship and innovation and decrease exports. As discussed below, a number of design features have been incorporated into option 3 (Customs’ preferred option) and option 4 (Inland Revenue’s preferred option) that are designed to minimise compliance costs for suppliers and electronic marketplaces, and as such are intended to minimise the risk of adverse trade and consumer impacts. Electronic marketplaces Under the rules proposed in the discussion document for electronic marketplaces, where a supply of low-value goods is made through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to make the supply for GST purposes. The $60,000 registration threshold would therefore apply to the marketplace operator’s deemed supplies to New Zealand consumers, as well as any other taxable supplies the marketplace operator makes. Where the operator of the electronic marketplace is deemed to be the supplier, whether or not the actual supplier of the goods is above the $60,000 registration threshold is irrelevant for determining whether or not GST applies to the supply. The design and scope of the marketplace rules were commented on in many of the submissions received. A number of submissions noted that business models for marketplaces vary widely and as such, a simple extension of the existing rules for cross- border services and intangibles to marketplaces for goods may not be appropriate. Submissions noted that clarity, simplicity and flexibility would be crucial to ensuring the marketplaces rules are workable. Discussions with stakeholders also indicated that clear and simple rules would be crucial to making the marketplace rules workable. Submissions from electronic marketplaces were strongly opposed to the proposed offshore supplier registration system and in particular the proposed rules for electronic marketplaces. Submissions from electronic marketplaces raised the following objections: • The proposed electronic marketplace rules are onerous for marketplaces to implement and are more complex that the rules requiring operators of electronic marketplaces for services and intangibles to collect GST. • Complying with the rules will result in significant compliance costs for marketplaces and it is unfair for the New Zealand Government to impose these costs on marketplaces. These costs may either be passed on to their suppliers, increasing the risk of these suppliers choosing not to ship to New Zealand, or will at least be Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 50 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 27 partly borne by consumers, therefore imposing additional costs on consumers over and above the amount of the tax. • Marketplaces may not have and may be unable to obtain sufficient information to correctly determine the amount of GST payable. • Marketplaces that do not process transactions between buyers and sellers on their platform may have difficulties in collecting the GST they are liable to remit. • Requiring marketplaces to collect GST on supplies made by third party suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold would place these suppliers at a disadvantage, would be discriminatory, and would lead to market distortions. • Compliant marketplaces will be at risk of third party sellers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold switching to selling through small or non-compliant marketplaces or to selling on their own websites. • Consumers will seek out small or non-compliant marketplaces or suppliers to avoid the tax, giving an unfair competitive advantage to suppliers and marketplaces that are not complying with the rules and disadvantaging the marketplaces and suppliers that would comply. This may result in decreased compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protections and dangerous goods. • Electronic marketplaces that are only caught by the electronic marketplace rules because they set some of the terms and conditions under which offshore sellers make sales on the marketplace would be able to easily structure out of being deemed to be the supplier of the goods by simply ensuring they do not set any of the terms and conditions of sale. This would reduce the level of compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protection and prohibited or dangerous goods. As noted in section 3.3, two exceptions to the deemed supplier approach (a Commissioner discretion and the rebuttable presumption model) were considered but ultimately ruled out. The proposed rules for electronic marketplaces are considered to be crucial to the success of the offshore supplier registration system. Without such rules, it is expected that thousands of suppliers that sell through marketplaces would be required to register for GST, meaning that aggregate compliance costs may be higher, compliance would likely be lower and enforcement more difficult. Narrowing the scope of the proposed rules is also unpalatable as the creation of a new boundary would be likely to create opportunities for electronic marketplaces to structure out of the rules, and may distort competition between electronic marketplaces. While still hypothetically possible, these risks are considered to be less significant under the proposed rules. Given the current market dominance of the most prominent electronic marketplaces, the extent to which having electronic marketplaces collect GST on sales by suppliers below the registration threshold would give a competitive advantage to small or non-compliant marketplaces is not entirely clear. For instance, in an online shopping environment, consumers already have strong incentives to purchase from trusted websites. It is not clear that avoiding GST of 15% on a low-value purchase (which may still Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 51 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 28 be significantly cheaper than a similar item sourced domestically) would provide enough incentive for many consumers to switch to shopping on websites that may not be as well- known or reputable as the larger marketplaces, and therefore which may be less readily trusted by consumers. It is also unclear whether the imposition of GST on what is likely to be only a small proportion of most suppliers’ sales would be a large enough motivator for smaller suppliers to establish their own websites or switch to selling through a marketplace that would likely reach a smaller audience. If these suppliers consider that the revenue from these sales does not justify the costs to them associated with having the marketplace operator charge GST on their sales to New Zealand, a more likely possibility seems to be that these suppliers would simply stop shipping goods to New Zealand, rather than leave the electronic marketplace altogether (at least if they are selling through a global marketplace as opposed to a New Zealand-specific website). However, the extent to which this may eventuate is also unknown, given that the marketplace operator would be fulfilling the bulk of the GST compliance obligations for the supplier (although these compliance costs may be passed on to underlying suppliers). Marketplace operators’ concerns about being provided with incorrect or inadequate information to determine the GST treatment of supplies and any associated liabilities in respect of these supplies should be addressed by the Commissioner discretion to prescribe or agree to a method for determining the GST treatment of supplies. Concerns about bad debts risk for electronic marketplaces that do not actually collect the money from the consumer should also be addressed by the suggested bad debt deduction. Low-value goods threshold Several submitters commented on the $400 threshold that was proposed in the discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system. Most of these submitters expressed a preference for a $1,000 threshold, which was considered to reduce compliance costs for suppliers (since it is closer to Australia’s low- value threshold of AU$1,000 than $400 is), as well as being better for consumers and for the freight and logistics industry. In comparison, only two submitters expressed a strong preference for a $400 threshold. It appears that this preference was based on concerns about a potential fiscal risk in relation to goods valued between $400 and $1,000, on which GST is (or should be) collected at present. Inland Revenue officials consider that the overall compliance costs to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers associated with a $1,000 threshold would be lower than the overall compliance costs to these businesses if a $400 threshold is chosen. Implementing a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would also be more beneficial for New Zealand consumers compared with a $400 threshold. However, Customs has concerns about the potential impacts of a $1,000 threshold on the management of border risk. Impacts on suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers While the vast majority of goods imported by consumers are of a very low value (consumer Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 52 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 29 surveys and Customs import entry data show that the average value is less than $100), a number of e-commerce businesses will also stock goods that may be more expensive, such as certain types of clothing, jewellery, watches and electronics, which some New Zealand consumers may potentially import. The existence of a low-value goods threshold of any value therefore creates additional complexity for suppliers who supply goods both above and below the threshold, as their checkout systems would need to be set up to charge GST on goods individually valued at or below that threshold and not on those valued above that threshold. Also, because the threshold is defined in New Zealand dollars, the supplier’s systems would also need to perform a currency conversion where the prices of the goods on their website are expressed in a foreign currency for the purposes of determining whether a given good is above or below the low-value goods threshold. By increasing the proposed $400 low-value goods threshold to $1,000, the number of suppliers that may sell goods both above and below the threshold would be reduced. This would decrease the number of suppliers that would need to implement systems to differentiate between high and low-value goods and have differing GST treatments for high and low-value goods (since if they do not stock any goods valued above the threshold they will not need to distinguish and can simply add GST to all of their sales to New Zealand consumers without requiring complex foreign exchange conversions at the time of sale). As Australia has a low-value threshold of AU$1,000 under their equivalent rules, there would be some suppliers that are already registered in Australia that only supply goods below Australia’s threshold. At present, these suppliers do not need to build systems to distinguish between low and high-value goods, as these suppliers can simply add GST to all of their supplies made to Australian consumers. However, some of these suppliers would sell goods both above and below $400 – therefore if New Zealand sets a $400 low- value goods threshold these suppliers would need to build additional systems to those already implemented for Australia in order to comply. This may be much less of an issue with a higher threshold that is much closer to Australia’s threshold, such as $1,000. Impacts on consumers Some submissions from consumers expressed support for removing cost recovery charges collected on consignments valued above the current de minimis. Increasing the proposed low-value goods threshold to $1,000 would see the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs from most goods imported by consumers. This would mean that consumers importing goods between $400 and $1,000 would actually pay less overall for these goods than they do at present. This would also ensure the overwhelming majority of consumers are no longer surprised or inconvenienced by having to pay additional GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges. Further, Customs would continue to collect cost recovery charges on consignments of goods that have had GST is collected at the point of sale by the supplier where the total consignment is valued above the threshold. A $400 threshold may mean there would be more instances of consumers having to pay these cost recovery charges where they might have expected that they would not have to (as they had already paid GST). Having offshore suppliers collect GST on a broader range of goods (in terms of value) would also provide greater price transparency for consumers, as offshore websites may be more likely to display a GST-inclusive price for all of their goods at the time of purchase. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 53 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 30 This would provide a fairer price comparison with New Zealand retailers who generally display GST-inclusive prices. A $1,000 threshold is also expected to be less distortionary than a $400 threshold. Anecdotally, many consumers at present limit their online purchases to a maximum of $400 to avoid having their goods stopped at the border. A $1,000 threshold may mean that less consumers would limit their spending to avoid having goods stopped at the border or to avoid the collection of duties and cost recovery charges. On the other hand, a $1,000 threshold may increase consumers’ incentives to seek out and purchase from unregistered suppliers or to have items purchased and sent to New Zealand by friends and family overseas. Double taxation While the inclusion of the 5 percent rule in option two would be expected to help to reduce compliance costs for a number of suppliers associated with differentiating between low- value and high-value goods, one issue with combining this design option with a threshold of $400 is that it would be likely to further increase the incidence of double taxation. Increasing the proposed threshold to $1,000 however would greatly reduce the potential for double taxation to occur as much fewer consignments valued over $1,000 are imported by consumers, compared with the number of consignments valued over $400. Based on 2017/18 transactional banking data showing goods purchases by New Zealand consumers from offshore suppliers, there were 230,398 transactions between $400 and $1,000 and only 56,671 transactions between $1,000 and $2,000. Furthermore, the vast majority of consignments valued above $1,000 would be imported by GST-registered businesses and would not be subject to the proposed rules. Border and biosecurity risks Importers are incentivised by Customs’ penalty regime to ensure that accurate imported entry information is provided in relation to imported consignments on which revenue is collectable. The penalties for providing inaccurate information for consignments on which no revenue is assessable are however smaller, and therefore provide less incentive for importers to ensure the accuracy of this information; consequently, the quality of information provided in relation to these consignments tends to be poorer. Customs and MPI consider that setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may therefore reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments under $1,000. As well as potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management, poor quality information may also impact on the efficiency of border processes. Customs considers that non-compliance in the valuation of goods to evade duty will continue to exist under a $1,000 threshold. This may also increase costs to both agencies and slow down the clearance of goods at the border. Customs has a range of sanctions to encourage the provision of accurate information and will continue to work with customs brokers, fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post, but it will remain a challenge for both agencies to manage risks. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 54 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 31 Impacts on goods transporters and customs brokers Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may be beneficial for fast freight carriers, customs brokers and New Zealand Post, with fewer goods stopped at the border for revenue collection. This would reduce the costs that New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers currently incur in transporting consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. New Zealand Post noted in their submission that they currently incur a significant compliance cost burden in facilitating the collection of GST (and other charges) and holding goods in storage on behalf of Customs. New Zealand Post considered that having a $1,000 threshold would therefore reduce their compliance costs. It is also noted that the effects of inflation and the expected continuation of the rapid growth in import volumes experienced over the last few years (and in particular the growth in the volume of low-value goods imported by post) will further exacerbate the existing pressures on border processing of low-value imported goods over time, which may mean that maintaining a low-value goods threshold of $400 may not be cost-effective in the medium term (at least not for New Zealand Post). GST revenue A risk with having a $1,000 threshold is that it may put at risk the GST currently collected by the Crown on imported goods valued between $400 and $1,000. In 2017/18 approximately $4.26 million of GST was collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers valued under $400, and $22.40 million was collected on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. 14 While a $1,000 threshold does put more currently collected GST at risk, Inland Revenue considers that most of this currently collected GST would continue to be collected under option three. A $1,000 threshold may even have some benefits for GST revenue collection including: • increasing the number of suppliers with a liability to register by increasing offshore suppliers’ level of taxable supplies (as supplies of goods valued between $400 and $1,000 would also be taxable supplies); • reducing the risk of GST not being collected on goods between $400 and $1,000 owing to undervaluation as, even if the supplier undervalued the goods, when the goods are supplied through a marketplace the marketplace will still collect the correct amount of GST; and • reducing the reliance on New Zealand Post to identify when goods sent by post are above the de minimis. 14 W e have assumed that 30% of consignments between the de minimis and $400 and 44% of imported consignments between $400 and $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses. These estimates of the business share of imported goods are derived from Australian data, as we do not have any New Zealand data on this. It is possible that the business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 is higher in New Zealand owing to New Zealand’s lower de minimis (likely resulting in fewer consumers importing consignments above $400). If New Zealand has a higher business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 then the net amount of GST collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers would be lower. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 55 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 32 Customs’ and MPI’s cost recovery charges Setting the low-value goods threshold at $400 would result in a reduction in Customs’ and MPI’s cost-recovered funding of $2.92 million per year based on the amount collected in 2017/18. Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 would result in Customs and MPI forgoing more cost-recovered funding. In 2017/18 $17.795 million (GST exclusive) was collected through Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee ($10.736 million) and MPI’s Biosecurity System Entry Levy ($7.059 million) on consignments below $1,000. A low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would therefore require a greater amount of Crown funding to replace the additional cost- recovered funding forgone. Customs’ and MPI’s costs of processing goods are also expected to increase due to expected volume growth and ongoing resource impacts. Therefore, regardless of what threshold is chosen, or even if no action is taken, Crown funding for Customs and MPI is likely to need to be increased over time in response to increasing import volumes. Tariff revenue Changing from the current de minimis of $60 duty owing to either a $400 or $1,000 low- value goods threshold will result in the loss of tariff revenue collected between the current de minimis a nd the low-value goods threshold. In 2017/18 $0.58 million was collected in tariffs on consignments between the current de minimis and $400 and $3.23 million was collected in tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. These tariffs are mainly collected on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries. MFAT does not consider that the loss of $0.58 million in tariffs from having a $400 threshold or of $3.23 million from there being a $1,000 threshold would significantly diminish the value of New Zealand’s remaining tariffs as negotiating coin in current and future Free Trade Agreements. MBIE, the agency responsible for tariff policy, also does not consider the revenue collected from these tariffs to be significant and supports the removal of tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. If the low-value goods threshold is set at $1,000, the loss of tariff revenue on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000 may potentially be seen as unfair to New Zealand retailers. A retailer that imports a consignment valued above $1,000 containing goods subject to tariffs will need to pay these tariffs to Customs. The tariffs paid by these businesses would ultimately be passed on to their customers. In contrast, if a consumer buys one of those goods directly from an offshore supplier they will not have to pay any tariffs if the good is shipped in a consignment valued at or below $1,000. Compared with setting the low-value goods threshold at $400, setting it at $1,000 does therefore further undermine the principle that taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation, but only in relation to a small subset of transactions. This is not considered to be likely to be significant in its impact as New Zealand has few remaining tariffs (mainly on clothing and footwear) and our free trade agreements have eliminated these tariffs for many countries including China, Australia and the 10 ASEAN countries. If no action is taken, the amount collected from tariffs is likely to continue to reduce over time as a result of current and future free Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 56 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 33 trade agreements. On balance Inland Revenue considers that this concern is outweighed by the efficiency benefits of setting the threshold at $1,000 and relinquishing tariff duty on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. New Zealand businesses importing low-value goods would also benefit from the removal of tariffs (and cost recovery charges) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. Net revenue impact Table 1 below shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period under options one and two. Table 2 shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period under option three. Table 1: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $400 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 73.000 109.000 121.000 303.000 Cost recovery charges (2.190) (2.920) (2.920) (8.030) GST net of cost recovery charges 70.810 106.080 118.080 294.970 Table 2: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $1,000 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 66.000 100.000 112.000 278.000 Cost recovery charges (13.346) (17.795) (17.795) (48.936) GST net of cost recovery charges 52.654 82.205 94.205 229.064 The estimates in the above tables do not account for any change in forgone cost- recovered funding over time. As noted earlier, the amount of additional Crown funding Customs and MPI would require under either low-value goods threshold option, or if no further action is taken, is likely to increase over time owing to growing import volumes. The tables above also do not account for any tariff revenue forgone under options one, two and three. This is because tariff revenue is decreasing over time owing to the phased implementation of New Zealand’s current and future free trade agreements, resulting in an annual reduction in the amount of goods that are subject to tariffs. In the 2017/18 year the amount collected in tariffs on consignments under $400 was $0.58 million and the amount collected under $1,000 was $3.23 million. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 57 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 34 Proposed exclusion for business-to-business supplies Under the proposed rules, only supplies of low-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers would be subject to GST. Supplies of low-value imported goods to GST- registered businesses would not be subject to GST. The rationale for excluding business- to-business supplies from the rules is to prevent a revenue risk arising from a resident business claiming a GST deduction for GST charged to them by an offshore supplier, but the offshore supplier not returning this GST to Inland Revenue. Three submissions proposed allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods. Submitters noted that identifying a customer as a GST-registered business can be difficult for suppliers to do, and that compliance costs arise for both the offshore supplier and the New Zealand business when GST is incorrectly charged. Furthermore, some submitters noted that the revenue risk from allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods may be relatively low. CA ANZ however was supportive of the proposed exclusion of business-to-business supplies. They noted that the exclusion of business-to-business supplies would mean some suppliers are outside the regime entirely because they only supply to businesses, which they agreed is desirable. They also considered that the exclusion would provide GST-registered recipients with an incentive to notify the supplier of their GST-registered status, which they considered would likely be easier than obtaining a valid tax invoice from the supplier. As noted in section 3.3, allowing offshore suppliers to charge GST on high-value business- to-business supplies was ruled out due to the fiscal risks involved. However, officials consider that the proposed design options under options two and three (of allowing offshore suppliers to issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies of low- value imported goods where the value of such a supply does not exceed $1,000, and allowing suppliers to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is to a GST-registered persons) should help to reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses. Allowing suppliers to charge GST and issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies valued at or below $1,000 may mean that suppliers would be rarely required to distinguish in practice. Compliance and enforcement A number of submitters were concerned whether the proposed rules could be effectively enforced. The submission from the electronic marketplace industry group suggested that the proposed system would result in only 25 percent of the currently forgone GST being collected, based on the Australian Treasury’s forecasted collection rate for the first year of the Australian legislation. Several submitters stated that where suppliers refuse to comply, it will be difficult and costly for Inland Revenue to enforce compliance from these suppliers. Concern was also raised in some submissions that offshore suppliers would avoid collecting GST by splitting their business into multiple entities in order to get below the $60,000 registration threshold. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 58 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 35 Based on the available evidence, officials consider that a relatively small number of suppliers and electronic marketplaces are likely to account for the majority of low-value goods imported by consumers. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine shows that 10 entities account for approximately 25 percent of the amount that consumers spent in 2017/18 on goods valued below $400 from offshore suppliers. Recent research by the International Post Corporation suggests that the five biggest electronic marketplaces account for around 50 percent of goods imported into New Zealand. On this basis, officials consider it is not unreasonable to assume that 75 percent of the GST that would be returned if all liable entities registered and complied will actually be collected (which is the assumption that was used in coming up with the revenue estimates). Application date A number of submissions discussed the proposed implementation date of 1 October 2019. Retail NZ and Booksellers NZ both expressed support for the earliest possible implementation date. In contrast, Alibaba, eBay and Etsy recommended that New Zealand should align our timeline with the European Union (EU), who will be extending their existing registration system for cross-border services to low-value goods imported from non-EU countries from January 2021. Business NZ recommended that the implementation date should be delayed if there are ongoing and persistent concerns over offshore suppliers blocking New Zealand buyers. A number of other submissions did not directly comment on the implementation date, but noted that a sufficient period of time would be needed for the necessary changes to be made by marketplaces, suppliers and others. Amazon in particular submitted that there would need to be a lead time of 18-24 months to allow for businesses to implement changes to systems and processes. Deloitte also recommended that the implementation date be reviewed with marketplaces and suppliers to ensure they have sufficient time to make the required changes. Officials still consider a 1 October 2019 implementation date to be feasible. However, any delays to the introduction or passing of legislation, or major changes to the legislation between introduction and the Royal assent would necessitate reconsideration of the implementation date. To give suppliers sufficient time to make any necessary systems changes and register, officials recommend that suppliers be given the option of having a six month taxable period for the first six months of the rules. This would mean that they would not be required to file their first GST return and pay the associated tax liability until 7 May 2020, essentially giving suppliers a three-month extension of time to register. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The costs to offshore suppliers would include registering for GST Potentially high upfront systems and Low Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 59 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 36 15 Monetised costs and benefits in this table have not been discounted, since for revenue measures the undiscounted figures (as opposed to net present value figures) make more intuitive sense and are the figures that are included in Budget estimates.

This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low-value goods and other minor systems changes.

Other impacts: GST would be collected on goods from offshore suppliers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold where the sale is made through a GST-registered electronic marketplace. From a revenue standpoint, this may be seen as an advantage, as it is expected that a significant amount of revenue would be collected on sales by offshore suppliers below the registration threshold though electronic marketplaces. Given the rationale of having a registration threshold is to balance compliance and administration costs against the revenue that would be generated if the supplier registered for GST, collecting GST on these supplies may be justified on the basis that the rationale behind the registration threshold is not as relevant, given that the marketplace operator would bear the bulk of the compliance costs. However, this may give rise to concerns about competitive disadvantages for marketplace operators and smaller offshore businesses selling through these marketplaces. Potential risks and uncertainties: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non- resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to offer shipping of goods to New Zealand. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 16 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 16 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 63 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 40 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments are currently being drafted and will be included in an upcoming tax bill. The proposal will also require amendments to some Customs regulations. These regulations will be updated by Order in Council. Both Inland Revenue and Customs will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue and Customs have not identified any concerns with their ability to implement the proposals in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’. The proposed changes are due to come into effect from 1 October 2019. Inland Revenue and Customs are confident that the proposals can be implemented within the proposed timeline. Inland Revenue has estimated that the one-off costs to implement these proposals will be up to $460,000. Inland Revenue’s on going administration costs are estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. Inland Revenue will self-fund the costs associated with the initiative. Customs expects the costs of systems changes for implementation at 1 October 2019 will be minimal in the short term. These costs will be met within existing baselines. Some offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers have expressed concern that a 1 October 2019 enactment date may not give them enough time to implement the necessary systems changes to comply. However, many of these stakeholders would have had 15 months of experience complying with Australia’s substantially similar rules and as such the systems changes required may not be substantial. It is also noted that the length of time between bill introduction and the application date for the GST on cross-border services and intangibles changes was similar to that n ow proposed for low-value imported goods. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The primary issue concerning implementation that has been raised through consultation is whether a 1 October 2019 application date gives offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers enough time to make the necessary systems changes in order to comply. To mitigate this risk the proposed changes will be made as simple as possible for these stakeholders. Furthermore, the proposed optional six month filing period for the first six months of the new rules would give these stakeholders an extra three months to update their systems before they need to file their first GST return. Another implementation risk is that offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers may not be aware of the new rules. To address this risk Inland Revenue will need to identify and communicate the legislative change to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers who might be required to register in New Zealand. A targeted marketing campaign would be needed to reach all the affected offshore suppliers and aid with compliance. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 64 of 107 Impact Statement Template | 41 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and MPI will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. Officials will monitor the extent to which offshore businesses no longer ship goods to New Zealand by keeping a close watch over articles in the media. Talking with private sector advisors and re-deliverers may also provide some indication of the extent to which this occurs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Officials from Inland Revenue and Customs will undertake a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold three years after the new rules are implemented. Officials will also continue to monitor the future viability of other collection models to see if the practical issues with these models can be overcome. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme.

Why is Government intervention required? The Government’s stated objective for ring-fencing rental losses is to reduce unfairness by levelling the playing field between property speculators/investors and owner-occupiers. Currently, investors can have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on their other income sources, helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Ring-fencing rental losses reduces the tax benefits enjoyed by property investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: •First-home buyers. Ring-fencing of rental losses could help improve first home buyers’ ability to compete with investors, improving housing affordability for home buyers, and potentially increasing the share of New Zealanders who own their own homes; and •Government. Ring-fencing of rental losses is expected to increase tax revenue by approximately $190 million per annum. 3. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 67 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 2 Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Investors. Residential property investors who negatively gear could face higher tax liabilities on an ongoing basis, if they persistently make a loss. It could be the case that investors start experiencing positive rental cash flows after a period. Inland Revenue estimates that approximately 40 percent of taxpayers with rentals record rental losses at any given time, with an average estimated annual tax benefit of $2,000; and • Renters. Rental loss ring-fencing will reduce after tax rental returns for some landlords. This could encourage the transfer of housing stock from investment housing (ie, rental housing) to owner-occupier housing, putting pressure on the remaining rental stock. On average, owner-occupied housing tends to have fewer people per house. This suggests that the transfer of housing stock from rental to owner-occupied may reduce the amount of housing available for each remaining renter unless there is an adequate flow of new housing onto the rental market. This may lead to increased rents. Landlords may also pass on their rental losses to tenants in the form of increased rents. There are other ways that this and other policies could impact the rental market, and officials note that there is significant uncertainty about the net impact. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Uncertainty around the impact on the housing market. The Government is closely monitoring the performance of the housing market. However, given the number of other policy and regulatory changes to the housing market, it may not be possible to isolate the impact of this proposal on the housing market. • Implementation risks for Inland Revenue. Changes will be required to START (Inland Revenue’s tax processing computer system). A detailed assessment of required changes and an execution plan is being made as part of returns planning for the 2019- 20 income year. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no incompatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Evidence supporting housing market impact analysis is limited, and suggests significant uncertainty as to the net impacts of the policy, especially on the rental market. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 68 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 3 Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using Inland Revenue data on negatively- geared rental properties. Significant simplifying assumptions have been made, on which the fiscal estimates are conditional. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Ring-fencing rental losses RIA prepared by the Treasury and Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it partially meets the quality assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIA describes how ring-fencing rental losses will meet the stated objective and also provides excellent coverage of the main uncertainties and risks around its likely impact. The analysis summarised in the RIA is as good as could be expected in light of the constrained range of options considered and the uncertainties over the net impacts of loss ring-fencing on the housing market. Even so, the analysis only partially meets the quality assurance criteria primarily because it is not possible to be confident that the stated objective is being met in the best way and with the least unintended consequences. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 69 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 4 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses Section 1: General information Purpose 1.1.1 The Treasury and Inland Revenue are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing key policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis 1.1.2 The key limitations and constraints applying to this analysis are as follows: a) Constrained range of options considered: The Government has already announced its intention to introduce ring-fencing of rental losses. Options considered are therefore focussed on key design settings for that policy, rather than consideration of alternatives to loss ring-fencing. b) Time constraints: Ministers have decided to plan for the introduction of loss ring- fencing rules for the 2019-20 tax year. With that commencement date in mind, the proposals are required to be included in legislation introduced before the start of the 2019-20 income year to give taxpayers a degree of certainty about how the rules will operate. c) Lack of empirical data: The analysis on the impact of this policy on the housing market is constrained by a lack of empirical data. There are few recent examples of countries implementing loss ring-fencing rules. In cases where such rules have been introduced (for example, in Australia in the 1980s), it has been difficult to tease out the effects of loss ring-fencing rules on observed changes in the housing market. When empirical evidence is not available, a theoretical assessment of the expected impact has been provided. d) Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: Ring-fencing of rental losses is estimated to increase tax revenue by approximately $190m per annum once fully implemented. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast is that it assumes static behaviour. A change towards greater equity investment in rental housing, or a change away from investment in residential rental properties altogether, could displace revenue from other taxable investments. This impact is not captured in the revenue forecast. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 70 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 5 Responsible Manager: Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy & Strategy Inland Revenue 1 August 2018 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 71 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? 2.1.1 First home buyers account for 22% of home purchases in New Zealand, compared with 39% for multiple property owners. This may suggest that first home buyers can struggle to compete against investors and existing owner-occupiers in the market. Home ownership rates have now fallen to 63% - down from 74% in 1991. 1 Source: CoreLogic NZ 2.1.2 Speculative capital gain is a likely driver for investor activity in the residential housing market. The average return on rental property excluding capital gains is low – the average gross rental yield on a three-bedroom Auckland property is 3% per annum. 2 This suggests investors are buying property in anticipation of capital gain. Other possible drivers for investor activity include the prospect of future increases in rents, or because it is perceived as safer than other types of investments. 2.1.3 Falling rates of home ownership, untaxed capital gains, and increasing house prices contribute to equity concerns around housing, and there is strong interest in measures to improve housing affordability, especially for first home buyers. 2.1.4 In this context, negative gearing has come under scrutiny. Negative gearing involves investors reducing their taxable income with rental losses. The practice is relatively widespread in the New Zealand rental market – 40% of taxpayers with residential investment property report rental losses, with an average tax benefit of $2,000 per annum. 1 https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/dwelling-and-household-estimates-dec ember-2017-quarter 2 https://www.barfoot.co.nz/market-reports/2017/december/changes-in-gross-yield Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 72 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 7 2.1.5 We expect the practice of negative gearing of rental properties to continue if no further action is taken. The magnitude of losses being claimed is likely to be dependent on changes in the housing market (for example, increases in rents will tend to reduce rental losses, all other things being equal), and interest rates. 2.1.6 Many overseas countries have some form of loss ring-fencing of residential property, including the United Kingdom and the United States. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? 2.2.1 Investment housing is currently taxed under the same rules that generally apply to other investments. This means that rents are income, and interest and other expenses (other than capital improvements) are deductible. Any capital gain realised on sale of the property is not taxed unless the property is held on revenue account. Revenue account land holders are predominantly dealers, developers, and people who acquire properties for resale (though there are a number of other rules that may mean a property is on revenue account, including the bright-line test, which taxes sales of residential properties within a defined time period). Most rental property investors hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain. 2.2.2 Currently, investors (including those who hold their property on capital account and are not subject to tax on the capital gain) can use losses from the rental properties to offset their income from other sources, thus reducing their income tax liability. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? 2.3.1 The policy problem is that there is an uneven playing field between property investors who are buying property in anticipation of capital gain, and owner-occupiers. Currently, investors can have part of the cost of servicing their mortgages subsidised by the reduced tax on other sources of income, helping them to outbid owner- occupiers (whose mortgages are not tax-deductible) for properties. 2.3.2 Rental housing is not formally tax favoured. However, there is an argument that it may be under-taxed compared to other asset classes given that tax-free capital gains are often realised when rental properties are sold. The fact that rental property investors often make persistent tax losses is a possible indication that expected capital gains are an important motivation for many investors purchasing rental property. While interest and other expenses are fully deductible, in the absence of a comprehensive capital gains tax, not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. There is therefore an argument that, to the extent deductible expenses in the long-term exceed income from rents, those expenses in fact relate to the capital gain, so should not be deductible unless the capital gain is taxed. It is reasonable to suppose that there is a widespread perception of unfairness, especially in the context of falling rates of home ownership, untaxed capital gains, and increasing house prices (see above in section 2.1). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 73 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 8 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? 2.4.1 The Government has committed to implementing loss ring-fencing. Officials have therefore only considered options as to different broad approaches to ring-fencing, and have not considered alternatives to loss ring-fencing. 2.4.2 The Government has also established the Tax Working Group (the TWG) to look at the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The TWG’s Terms o f Reference include a requirement that particular consideration be given to “\[w\]hether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system.” 3 Because consideration of a capital gains tax is within the purview of the TWG, it is not considered here as a possible option for addressing the issue that underlies the concern about investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain having an unfair advantage over owner-occupiers – which is that not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. If a comprehensive capital gains tax were to be implemented, there could be a case for reconsidering whether rental loss ring-fencing is necessary. We note that the Government has stated that any significant changes legislated for from the TWG’s final report will not come into force until the 2021 tax year. 4 2.4.3 There are a range of Government policies and initiatives concerning housing. Supply-side initiatives include KiwiBuild, Special Housing Areas, and infrastructure financing and funding efforts. Demand side initiatives include extension of the bright- line test, restrictions on foreign buyers, and the Reserve Bank’s loan-to-value ratio loan restrictions. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? 2.5.1 Prior to releasing an officials’ issues paper for consultation, officials had initial discussions on the proposal with a number of key private sector advisors, including tax professionals and the New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation. Those discussions were aimed at gathering private sector views on key design issues and potential implementation and compliance concerns. 2.5.2 An officials’ issues paper Rental loss ring-fencing was released in March 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 106 submissions in response to this issues paper. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. 3 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/terms-of-reference/ 4 https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/towards-f airer-tax-s ys tem-tax-working-group-terms-ref erenc e-announced Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 74 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 9 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? 3.1.1 Our options analysis looks at the following packages of key design options for the proposed loss ring-fencing rules: Option 1: Status quo. Option 2: Design options proposed in the officials’ issues paper. Option 3: Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper. 3.1.2 The options considered in relation to each of the above key design issues are as follows: (all options are mutually exclusive) Option 1: Status quo 3.1.3 There are no rules which ring-fence rental losses, therefore any losses incurred on a rental property can be offset against the taxpayer’s other income. Option 2: Design options proposed in the officials’ issues paper 3.1.4 This option reflects the package of design features which were proposed in the officials’ issues paper released for public consultation in March 2018. Land within the scope of the proposed rules 3.1.5 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules are to apply to residential land. There is already a definition of “residential land” in the Income Tax Act 2007, and the loss ring-fencing rules would apply to land within that definition. Using the definition already in the legislation would avoid the additional complexity of having different definitions for different rules. The options for what property the rules should apply to are around what residential land should be excluded from the scope of the rules. 3.1.6 The rules are not proposed to apply to residential land that is the taxpayer’s main home, or residential land that is subject to the mixed-use asset rules. 3.1.7 The rules will not apply to residential land that is on revenue account because the taxpayer acquires the property for the purpose of a land-related business. 5 3.1.8 Finally, the rules will apply to residential land that is owned by all persons, including companies and trusts. Level at which the loss ring-fencing rules should apply (ie, at the individual property level or across a portfolio) 3.1.9 Losses are ring-fenced within a portfolio of residential property. If a taxpayer has a 5 And in the case of a business of erecting buildings, the taxpayer or an associated person made improvements to the land.

Whether ring-fenced losses should be released on the sale of a residential property 3.1.10 Ring-fenced losses are able to be used on a sale of residential land that gives rise to taxable income; to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced. What rules should be put in place to minimise opportunities to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules 3.1.11 This option would include specific rules to address a structuring opportunity to get around the new rules. These concern interest allocation and the interposing of entities. 3.1.12 There will be specific rules to ensure that interposed entities cannot be used to circumvent the loss ring-fencing rules. 3.1.13 There should not be any specific rules for allocating a taxpayer’s interest expenditure as between ring-fenced residential property and other assets. Option 3: Design options reflecting submissions received on the officials’ issues paper Land within the scope of the proposed rules 3.1.14 In addition to the design features in Option 2 for property within the scope of the proposed rules, three further exclusions are proposed. 3.1.15 All land that will definitely be subject to tax on sale will be excluded from these rules. 3.1.16 The rules will not apply to widely-held companies, because any residential land they hold is assumed to be incidental to their business. 3.1.17 The rules also will not apply to accommodation provided to employees or other workers where it is necessary to provide that accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business. Level at which the loss ring-fencing rules should apply (ie, at the individual property level or across a portfolio) 3.1.18 While the rules will generally apply on a portfolio basis, taxpayers will also be able to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish, so if a property is taxed on sale any remaining losses for that property can be released and used to offset against other income. If such an election is not made, then the rules will continue to apply on a portfolio basis. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 76 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 11 Using ring-fenced losses 3.1.19 Ring-fenced losses should be able to be transferred between companies in a wholly- owned group with rental income. It is not proposed that ring-fenced losses should be able to be carried back. 3.1.20 The usual shareholder continuity rules which apply to the use of losses by companies under the general corporate tax rules will continue to apply to ring-fenced losses. Losses should not be released and available to offset against other income if shareholder continuity is breached. Whether ring-fenced losses should be released on the sale of a residential property 3.1.21 There is no change from Option 2 for this design feature. Ring-fenced losses are able to be used on a sale of residential land that gives rise to taxable income, but only to the extent those losses reduce the taxable income to nil. What rules should be put in place to minimise opportunities to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules 3.1.22 There is no change from Option 2 for this design feature. There will be specific rules to ensure that interposed entities cannot be used to circumvent the loss ring-fencing rules, but no specific interest allocation rules. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? 3.2.1 The generic tax policy process (GTPP) includes a framework for assessing key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals. This framework is consistent with the Government’s vision for the tax and social policy system, and is captured by the following criteria: • Efficiency and neutrality – the tax system should bias economic decisions as little as possible; • Fairness and equity – similar taxpayers in similar circumstances should be treated in a similar way; • Efficiency of compliance – compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as possible; and • Efficiency of administration – administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. 3.2.2 Efficiency and fairness are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading-off increased compliance costs or administration costs for gains in these two criteria. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 77 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 12 3.3.1 As noted at section 2.4, because consideration of a capital gains tax is within the purview of the TWG, it is not considered here as a possible option for addressing the concern that investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain, and who are able to deduct expenses, have an unfair advantage over owner-occupiers – which is that not all of the economic income generated from rental housing is subject to tax. 3.3.2 Therefore, options considered are focussed on key design settings for loss ring- fencing, rather than consideration of alternatives to loss ring-fencing.

The reasons this option is the preferred approach are discussed below. Land within the scope of the proposed ring-fencing rules 5.1.2 As noted above, the proposed loss ring-fencing rules are to apply to residential land as already defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. For the reasons discussed below, we consider that the main home, mixed-use land, certain revenue account land, land owned by widely-held companies, and employee and farming accommodation should be excluded from the scope of the rules, and that land owned by companies and trusts should not be excluded. 5.1.3 It is noted that all of this option is generally neutral as compared to the status quo (no change from the current rules), because all of these options are around what land should be outside the scope of the proposed loss ring-fencing rules – which means the current treatment would remain applicable. Main home 5.1.4 As noted above, the concern the proposed ring-fencing rules are aimed at addressing is the uneven playing field between property speculators/investors and owner-occupiers. This is because rental losses can be used by investors to reduce their tax on income from other sources – effectively subsidising part of the cost of their mortgages, and helping them to outbid owner-occupiers for properties. 5.1.5 The focus of the proposed rules is on loss-making rental properties, so it is recommended that a taxpayer’s main home be specifically excluded from the scope of the rules. Submitters on the officials’ issues paper have indicated that they agreed with this approach. 5.1.6 While part of someone’s main home may be rented out, and this activity could generate a loss, it is not considered that such a situation contributes to an uneven playing field between investors who buy property in anticipation of capital gain and owner-occupiers. 5.1.7 We suggest that the concept of a “main home” mirror that used for the purposes of the bright-line test – which would mean that a person can have only one main home, and that to qualify for the exclusion the property has to be used predominantly as the person’s main home. However, we suggest one difference from the bright-line main home exclusion, in that a qualifying property should be used predominantly as the person’s main home for most of the income year in question, rather than for most of the time the person owns the property (which is the case for the bright-line main home exclusion). This makes more sense in the context of loss ring-fencing, as the focus is not on the length of ownership, but on Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 80 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 15 the use of the property. Mixed-use land 5.1.8 The existing definition of “residential land” would also include holiday houses that are sometimes used privately and sometimes rented out. Many such properties would be subject to the mixed-use asset rules. 5.1.9 The mixed-use asset rules provide for the apportionment of expenditure. Notwithstanding the apportionment formula, a tax loss can still arise for a mixed- use asset. This is more likely to occur when the income-earning use of the asset is low. Therefore, the mixed-use assets rules quarantine (or ring-fence) losses where there is low income-earning use of an asset. Under the quarantining rules, a person who is in an occasional loss position will not be able to offset their loss against other income in the current year, but will be able to use it against their future profits from the mixed-use asset. However, a person who is in perpetual loss will never have future profits to offset the losses against, and will therefore not be able to utilise them. 5.1.10 Property subject to the mixed-use asset rules should be scoped out of the ring- fencing rules, because the mixed-use asset rules will cover most if not all mixed- use asset losses. Certain revenue account land 5.1.11 We suggest that the ring-fencing rules should not apply to taxpayers who hold land on revenue account because they are in a land-related business. 6 Taxpayers in certain businesses relating to land hold their land on revenue account, so the profits on sale will be taxed. This applies to people in the business of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings. At balance date, such taxpayers may have a number of properties on hand, though they may not be currently rented out. The policy rationale for loss ring-fencing in these situations is weakened as the capital gains are already taxed. Submitters did not think the loss ring-fencing rules should apply to such taxpayers, as this could discourage new developments, which would be a barrier to increasing housing supply. 5.1.12 As discussed below, we suggest that rental losses are able to be used against taxable land sales to the extent they reduce the taxable gain to nil, with any further unused losses remaining ring-fenced to future rental income or taxable gains on other land sales. While developers, dealers, etc, may have losses in respect of properties on hand at balance date, those losses being able to be used against income from other sales or rental activity in the year would mean that their businesses would be unlikely to be disadvantaged by the ring-fencing rules. In most cases the income from their sale or rental activity would be expected to exceed their losses. 5.1.13 However, in any overall loss-making year, we do not consider it necessary to ring- fence losses for these taxpayers. This would enable those taxpayers to use losses 6 As per section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 81 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 16 arising in any year against other income – for example within their consolidated group (as they are likely to be companies). There is not the same concern in relation to these taxpayers about any of their deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains, as all of their land is on revenue account. 5.1.14 In addition to the exclusions for revenue account land described in Option 2, submitters commented that all land that will definitely be subject to tax on sale should be excluded from these rules. This includes for example, land that was bought with the intention of resale or land that had been subject to more than minor development or division work within 10 years of acquisition. We recommend that if land is identified to Inland Revenue as being on revenue account not subject to any contingencies (for example, being sold within a particular time period), that land should be considered to be definitely subject to tax and excluded from the scope of the ring-fencing rules, as all of the economic income will be subject to tax. Land owned by companies and trusts 5.1.15 Some private sector advisers and submitters on the issues paper suggested that the ring-fencing rules should apply only to individuals (ie, natural persons) and look-through companies, and not to other companies or trusts. It was noted that company losses are effectively ring-fenced inside the company, as are losses in a trust. It was also noted that the rules would apply to some large companies (for example, large power companies that hold some residential rental property), imposing compliance costs on those companies, in circumstances that were unlikely to be the target of the reform. 5.1.16 While there is some argument that losses are ring-fenced within a company, so there is no need for the rules to apply to companies, officials do not consider that additional compliance costs for some large corporates would justify rules that apply only to individual taxpayers. This would leave open the possibility of holding rental properties in a company, trading trust, or family trust, and offsetting rental losses against other income. Limiting the ring-fencing rules to individuals would, therefore, significantly undermine the fairness of the rules. We therefore do not recommend this option. Land owned by widely-held companies 5.1.17 The design features in Option 2 included within the scope of the proposed ring- fencing rules all land held by trusts and companies, including land owned by widely-held companies. A number of submitters on the officials’ issues paper commented that applying the ring-fencing rules would create substantial compliance costs for large companies which are not the target of the proposal. It was noted that large companies often hold residential land incidentally to their business (for example as sites for future development, or for employee accommodation). In these circumstances, the mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the hope of capital gains from the properties is not present. For that reason we recommend that widely-held companies be excluded from the scope of the rules. Employee and farming accommodation Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 82 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 17 5.1.18 The design features in Option 2 did not carve out land used to provide accommodation to employees, or as part of their farming business. A number of submitters have suggested that these should be carved out of the ring-fencing rules. Submitters considered that such properties have no connection to the mischief the ring-fencing rules are seeking to address, and including them would create compliance costs without any corresponding benefit. 5.1.19 We agree that it would not undermine the rules to exclude accommodation provided to employees (or other workers, as will often be the case in farming) where it is necessary to provide that accommodation due to the nature or remoteness of the business. In such situations the perceived mischief of offsetting property losses against labour or other income with the hope of capital gains from the properties is not present. We therefore recommend such an exclusion. Level of ring-fencing 5.1.20 The proposed loss ring-fencing rules could be applied either on a property-by- property basis or on a portfolio basis. A portfolio approach would mean that investors could offset losses from one rental property against rental income from other properties, calculating their profit/loss on their overall portfolio. This may be seen as less equitable than a property-by-property approach, in that it may favour wealthier taxpayers with larger property holdings. A property-by-property basis would mean that each property is looked at separately, so losses on one cannot offset income from another. 5.1.21 A property-by-property approach could, in theory, be more effective in reducing tax benefits to investors. In practice, however, a property-by-property approach could result in de facto portfolio outcomes. T axpayers could potentially rebalance their debt funding to avoid having loss-making properties, or at least minimise the extent to which any particular property is loss-making. 5.1.22 This taxpayer response would be inefficient, and may also mean that, in terms of the objective, a property-by-property approach may have no real advantage over a portfolio approach – adding complexity and increasing compliance costs for no gain. 5.1.23 Further, a property-by-property approach may be seen as unfair in that if a taxpayer has two properties and breaks even on the portfolio overall, the taxpayer’s tax position would depend on whether they break even on both properties or make a gain on one and a loss on the other. 5.1.24 Applying the rules on a portfolio basis would be significantly simpler than a property-by-property approach, from a compliance and administrative point of view, as this is how rental income is currently returned. The additional compliance costs a property-by-property approach would create, especially for investors holding many properties, was highlighted by private sector advisors. 5.1.25 We have looked at the approach to loss ring-fencing in other jurisdictions, and have not found any that apply an asset-by-asset approach. Typically, such rules are applied on a portfolio basis, or investments within particular categories are pooled (for example, in the United States, where ring-fencing applies to “passive activity” Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 83 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 18 losses). However, a property-by-property approach could arguably be more aligned to addressing concerns that large-scale investors who own multiple rentals are able to use losses on new acquisitions to continually reduce their tax. 5.1.26 Most submitters on the officials’ issues paper supported the rules applying on a portfolio basis, as it would be easier from a compliance point of view. However, some submitted that a portfolio approach penalises smaller “mum and dad” investors and favours investors with large portfolios. 5.1.27 Some submitters also suggested that taxpayers should be able to make an upfront election to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish. I f a property is taxed on sale any remaining losses for that property could then be released. Officials do not see any issue with taxpayers electing to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they are willing to bear any associated compliance costs in order to be able to close out the net profit on that property. It is noted that some submitters advised they (or their advisors) already do this, so they did not see this as adding compliance costs for them. This option is desirable for taxpayers if it means any remaining losses after the taxable sale of a property can be released to be used against other income. We are recommending that be the case – this is discussed further in 5.1.41. 5.1.28 For the above reasons, we suggest that the ring-fencing rules generally apply on a portfolio basis, so a person with multiple properties would calculate their overall profit or loss across their whole residential portfolio. However, we also recommend that taxpayers who wish to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis should be allowed to do so. Using ring-fenced losses Grouping losses 5.1.29 In addition to the design features in Option 2, it has been submitted that losses should be able to be transferred between companies under the grouping rules. Often a corporate group will hold rental properties in a different entity to trading business properties. 5.1.30 We agree that ring-fenced losses should be able to be transferred between companies, but that this should be limited to companies in the same wholly-owned group, as the economic ownership is the same in that situation. It is acknowledged that this would be a higher threshold than is applied for the grouping of other losses. 5.1.31 Transferred losses should remain ring-fenced, so they are only able to be used in the relevant income year to the extent the transferee company has residential rental income or residential land sale income, with any remaining losses being carried forward and remaining ring-fenced. Carrying back ring-fenced losses 5.1.32 Some submitters suggested that losses should be able to be carried back as a typically profit-making property may make a loss in one year due, for example, to Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 84 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 19 large repairs and maintenance expenses or a period of vacancy. 5.1.33 We do not recommend that losses be able to be carried back. This would add complexity, and if a property is typically profit-making the carried forward losses would be available to offset against income in future years. Allowing losses to be carried back would also be inconsistent with general policy settings. Shareholder continuity 5.1.34 It has been submitted that companies could have losses ring-fenced when their overall position is tax paying, and that this would be unfair. It has been suggested either that the 49% shareholder continuity requirement should not apply to ring- fenced rental losses, or failing that, that if shareholder continuity is breached, losses should be made available to offset against other income. 5.1.35 The shareholder continuity rules reflect that it should be the shareholders at the time company losses arise who are able to benefit from them in the future. 5.1.36 We consider that it would undermine the credibility and fairness of the loss ring- fencing rules if ring-fenced rental losses were not subject to the shareholder continuity requirement, or if losses were released when continuity is breached. Release of losses on sale 5.1.37 In the case of a property with ring-fenced rental losses that is taxed under one of the land sale rules on disposal, there is an argument that the losses should be able to be fully utilised (ie, un-fenced) at that point, and be used to offset any other income of the taxpayer. This would reflect that all of the economic income from the investment has been taxed (the rental stream and the capital gain), and that the investor should not be penalised for making an overall loss on the investment. For this reason, not releasing losses that relate to a particular property on a taxable sale of that property would undermine neutrality and fairness. 5.1.38 However, if the rules are applied on a portfolio basis (which is the preferred option – see 5.1.21 to 5.1.27), allowing accumulated rental losses to give rise to a tax loss on a disposal subject to one of the land sale rules would create risks. For example, it would enable a portfolio investor to sell a property that has made a small capital gain within the bright-line period, offset that gain with ring-fenced losses from across their portfolio, and apply any remaining losses from the portfolio against other income. While there are ring-fencing rules in relation to the bright-line test, they only apply to deductions for the cost of the property, not other costs. 5.1.39 Enabling taxpayers to sell their lowest capital gain makers within the bright-line period and access what might be substantial portfolio-wide accumulated ring- fenced losses would significantly undermine the credibility of the rules. 5.1.40 Release on taxable sale, recognising that the full economic income had been taxed, would be the preferred option if the ring-fencing rules were to apply on a property-by-property basis. This is because it would only be losses that relate to the particular property that would be released. As noted at 5.1.21, a portfolio approach is preferred to a property-by-property approach because it would be Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 85 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 20 significantly simpler from a compliance and administrative point of view. However, as also noted at 5.1.27, we are recommending that taxpayers who wish to elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis be able to do so. For those properties, we think that the preferred option of fully releasing the ring-fenced losses should be adopted. This design feature would be in addition to the features identified in Option A. The new design feature of allowing an election to apply the rules on a property-by-property approach enables all the losses associated with a given property to be used against that property upon a taxable sale. 5.1.41 We therefore do not consider that ring-fenced losses should generally be fully released on a taxable sale of residential property, meaning the losses (if not exhausted from offsetting the income derived on sale) would be able to be used to offset other income. However, for those properties which have had the rules applied to them on a property-by-property basis on the taxpayer’s election, we recommend that the losses become fully unfenced if they are taxed upon sale. This would also be the case where the rules applied on a portfolio basis and all of the properties in a portfolio were sold and taxed. This would most commonly be the case for land that was taxable under the bright-l ine test because it was sold within five years of acquisition. 5.1.42 We do not recommend that losses become released on any sale of residential land if there was no tax on the sale of that property. Releasing losses on a non-taxable disposal would reduce the impact of ring-fencing to one of timing alone, which would reduce the effectiveness of the measure. Anti-structuring rules 5.1.43 There are two main structuring opportunities that have been considered in terms of whether specific rules are required. These concern interest allocation and the interposing of entities. Specific interest allocation rules 5.1.44 Without specific interest allocation rules, investors (particularly larger and more sophisticated investors) may be able to structure around the loss ring-fencing rules. For example, by reorganising funding so that business assets other than rental properties are debt-funded, and rental properties are equity-funded, to the greatest extent possible. This could undermine the credibility of the rules, neutrality, and fairness. 5.1.45 However, interest allocation rules would add substantial complexity, and increase compliance and administrative costs. Because money is fungible, it is very difficult to attempt to match borrowings to particular investments (tracing). Stacking rules (eg, allocating debt firstly to ring-fenced investments) may be seen as unfair. And pro rata interest allocation between assets that are subject to the ring-fencing rules and those that are not would require regular valuation of assets. 5.1.46 If interest on any loan that was secured by a residential property was included in the rules, this would create issues for many taxpayers who use their rental properties to secure loans for their businesses. This would impact on small and medium business’ access to capital. In addition, many arrangements could be Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 86 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 21 even more difficult to apply interest allocation rules to, as revolving credit facilities are often used to fund both a rental property and a business. 5.1.47 The private sector advisors who officials consulted were strongly of the view that the substantial complexity that interest allocation rules would add should be avoided. It was observed that such complex rules would be particularly onerous for smaller taxpayers to comply with. 5.1.48 Given the substantial complexity that interest allocation rules would introduce, we recommend against such rules. The ring-fencing rules will affect many taxpayers, with varying levels of sophistication and tax knowledge, and we consider it important that they remain as easy to apply as possible, and minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. Specific rules for interposed entities 5.1.49 We have considered whether there should be specific rules to mitigate the risk of taxpayers interposing entities to get around the loss ring-fencing rules. 5.1.50 Without rules to deal with interposed entities, a simple way taxpayers (particularly larger and more sophisticated taxpayers) could get around ring-fencing rules would be by interposing an entity (eg, a company) to separate a loan (and interest deduction) from the residential rental property, so the interest is not subject to ring- fencing. This could undermine the credibility of the rules, neutrality, and fairness. 5.1.51 In the 1980s, New Zealand had a loss restriction provision that capped the extent to which losses from rental, agricultural and horticultural activities could be offset against other income (the maximum was $10,000 per annum). There was also a provision that clawed back interest and development expenditure where land was sold within ten years of acquisition and the profit derived on sale was not otherwise assessable. A major failing of the interest claw back provision was the absence of specific rules to deal with simple structuring such as that noted above. As a result, a common strategy was to hold the land in a company and incur interest on funds borrowed to buy shares in the company. This meant that no interest was incurred with respect to the land, so there could be no clawback of interest deductions on sale. 7 5.1.52 While there is a general anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act, it may not be adequate to prevent the simple interposing of an entity to get around loss ring- fencing, as there are legitimate non-tax reasons for holding property in an entity. In addition, it is preferable from a certainty perspective to have specific rules to counter avoidance concerns rather than rely on the uncertain boundary inherent in the general anti-avoidance rule. There would be some administrative costs associated with a specific rule to deal with interposed entities, as compliance would need to be monitored. However, compared to relying on the general anti-avoidance rule, t his approach should reduce taxpayer compliance costs, uncertainty, and administrative costs. 7 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital (December 1989). Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 87 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 22 5.1.53 We therefore recommend a specific rule to deal with the interposing of entities, as this would otherwise be a simple mechanism to get around the loss ring-fencing rules, and would undermine their credibility. 5.1.54 The private sector advisors who officials consulted were in agreement that rules to deal with the above mechanism of interposing an entity should be developed, to maintain the integrity of the ring-fencing rules. 5.1.55 The officials’ issues paper consulted on a suggested approach to dealing with interposed entities. Submitters have proposed a number of technical refinements to the treatment of interposed entities proposed in Option 2, which we agree with. These are: • The 50% “residential property land-rich” threshold should take into account all residential properties, not just those within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. This is to ensure that the interposed entity rule applies even if the main home was held in the same entity as a rental property (which would often be worth less than the main home). We recommend that the rule therefore apply where over 50% of the entity’s assets are residential properties, not just residential properties within the scope of the ring-fencing rules. • Interest deductions for the owner of a “residential property land-rich” entity should not be ring-fenced to the extent the profit from the residential property or properties is sufficient to cover the interest, but is not distributed. This is appropriate as the properties are profitable overall, so there is no mischief in allowing the interest covered by the profits to be deducted in that year. • Where part of an entity’s capital is used to acquire a rental property, and part is applied to something else, the interest incurred by the shareholder to fund the entity’s capital should be allocated on a pro-rata basis between the uses to which the capital is applied. • Where the entity’s capital is used to acquire a rental property, and the entity also has another profitable activity that does not require any (or much) capital, the shareholder’s interest expenses should only be allocated to the extent of the entity’s profit from the rental activity. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Investors Residential property investors who negatively gear will face higher tax liabilities for as long $570m total over 5-year forec as t period (not High Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 88 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 23 8 Discussed further from paragraph 6.1,3, as they are making losses on their investment.

Uncertainty about housing market impacts 5.3.1 There is significant uncertainty about the net impact of the policy on the housing market, especially on the rental market. Overseas experience underlines the uncertainty in the direction and magnitude of housing market impacts. For example, negative gearing was banned in Australia between 1985 and 1987, and while rents spiked in Sydney during this period, they were flat or falling across much of the rest of the country. The exact relationship between the tax changes and observed changes in rent is unclear. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? 5.4.1 Yes.

Legislative process 6.1.1 Following consultation and final decisions on the design of the proposed rules, primary legislation will be prepared to give effect to loss ring-fencing. 6.1.2 It is currently anticipated that loss ring-fencing rules will take effect from the 2019- 20 income year. It is planned that legislation will be introduced before the start 9 of the income year the rules will apply from (the 2019-20 income year) – giving most taxpayers a degree of certainty about how the rules will operate. Implementation options 6.1.3 The rules could either apply in full from the outset, or alternatively they could be phased in over three years (ie, a third of a taxpayer’s losses are ring-fenced in year one, then two-thirds of their losses in year two). Tax law changes are not usually phased in, but this possible approach has been suggested to allow affected investors more time to adjust to the new rules, or to rearrange their affairs before the rules apply in full. However, we note that phased introduction of the rules would result in some additional complexity. 6.1.4 The officials’ issues paper sought feedback on whether the rules should apply in full from the 2019-20 income year, or be phased in over two or three years. Submitters were strongly in favour of phasing the rules in over three years. 6.1.5 A number of submitters considered that existing rental properties should be grandparented, on the basis that such a fundamental change to the rules after investments have been made would be unfair. Other submitters suggested that the rules should apply in full for properties acquired after an announced date, but phased in for existing properties (or existing properties grandparented). Officials consider that these suggestions would produce overly complex rules, and recommend that the rules either apply in full from the outset, or be phased in for all properties over three years. 6.1.6 On balance however, Inland Revenue considers that phasing in the changes could potentially create a precedent-setting risk and there is a stronger argument to apply the rules in full from the 2019-20 income year for all properties. 6.1.7 The Treasury prefers a split approach, with no phasing for new investments, and a three-year phase in for existing investments. This is on the basis that investments made after the ring-fencing rules have been introduced do not need time to adjust to the new rules, while acknowledging that some time may be necessary for existing investments. 6.1.8 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have expressed a 9 For standard balance date taxpayers. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 91 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 26 preference for a phased introduction for both existing and new investments. This is because if there are sales of some low quality rental properties in anticipation of the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act standards, as expected, a phased introduction of the loss ring-fencing rules could strengthen incentives for new owners to upgrade these rental properties quickly. Responsibility for ongoing operation and enforcement 6.1.1 Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for ongoing operation and enforcement of the new rules. Communications 6.1.2 When introduced to Parliament, commentary would be released explaining the new rules, and further explanation of the effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. The information on Inland Revenue’s website, booklets, etc, would be updated to explain the new rules to property investors. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? 6.2.1 Inland Revenue is currently delivering on its Business Transformation programme. It is anticipated that implementation of ring-fencing of rental losses will occur in START, as the proposed commencement date of 2019-20 occurs after the go-live of START major release 3 scheduled for April 2019. Implementation of the proposed rules will mean changes to START will be required. Officials expect these changes to be relatively minor. However, they are not yet fully scoped, costed and integrated into Inland Revenue’s 2019-20 annual returns plan, creating an implementation risk. 6.2.2 Successful implementation is based on taxpayers understanding the changes and how they apply to their situation. For those electing to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis, this explaining the changes in a simple way for them to understand may present an implementation risk. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 92 of 107 Impact Statement: Ring-fencing rental losses | 27 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? 7.1.1 Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.1.2 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment currently investigates trends in house prices and housing affordability, using a variety of measures to get a complete picture of affordability. For home buyers, this includes the level of house prices, how house prices compare to incomes, and the experimental Housing Affordability Measure for first home buyers. For renters, the data monitored includes rent levels and the Housing Affordability Measure for renters. The impact of loss ring-fencing may be seen in an improvement in measures of housing affordability for home purchasers, and may also be seen in the proportion of houses in each area that are purchased by first home buyers and investors – with the percentage of property purchased by first home buyers expected to increase over time as a result of the ring-fencing rules. The impact on rental affordability will be monitored to identify if there appear to be any significant negative impacts on renters from the policy. There is significant uncertainty about the scale of the potential impact of the policy on the housing market. Furthermore, because of the substantial number of factors that affect the housing market, including other policy interventions under development, it is likely to be difficult from a practical perspective to identify the causal impact of the proposed loss ring-fencing rules on affordability for first-home buyers, though housing affordability data may give some indication of the impact of the policy. 7.1.3 We will also monitor data on the amount of ring-fenced rental losses, which will provide an indication of the impact of the policy, and whether the proposed anti- structuring rules are effective. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? 7.2.1 We will monitor the first year of operation of new legislation, and if we identify anything that suggests a formal review is warranted we will undertake that – for example data that suggests significant negative impacts on the rental housing market. Stakeholders will have the ability to raise concerns with us, and if there is a need to make remedial amendments to the new rules these will be prioritised for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposed amendments would go through the GTPP. 7.2.2 It is noted that if a comprehensive capital gains tax were to be implemented, loss ring-fencing would be reviewed at that time.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing policy decisions to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Quality of data used for impact analysis Inland Revenue used public information available on holders of pre-1990 emission units to inform our analysis of the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary. This information, however, did not provide any insights about taxpayers’ use of the emission units, including decision-making behaviours over holding or trading these units. Targeted consultation with interested stakeholders was carried out to bridge this gap in our knowledge; however, for the reasons set out below, there were time constraints on the period of consultation. Consultation and testing A private sector stakeholder who raised the initial concerns about the tax treatment of arrangements to securitise emission units was influential in shaping the problem definition. While the ideal response to the concern was to include the issue in a wider context as part of an examination of the use of the financial arrangement rules, the scheduling of this review meant it could not address this issue in a sufficiently timely manner. Analysis of the problem definition and possible options for change led officials to conclude that there was a case for developing an interim solution, focusing on pre-1990 forestry emissions units only, which would address the stakeholder’s concern. The recommended interim solution is consistent with current tax policy settings and the framework underpinning the interim solution is sustainable and robust. A consequence of developing the interim solution in a sufficiently timely manner was that it truncated the timeframe that would otherwise be available for consultation to just over one week. Engagement with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sector was high, with most responding either via telephone or letter. Subject to decisions by Cabinet, further consultation on the detailed design of the proposal will be carried out before final decisions, as delegated by Cabinet, are made by Ministers. The wider review of the financial arrangement rules is on the Government’s tax policy work programme and will consider if the scope of the interim solution should be extended. 4.

This Regulatory Impact Analysis addresses the question of whether current taxation laws, particularly the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Income Tax Act), impedes financial decision-making by holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units that are held for intergenerational purposes. Pre-1990 forestry emissions units New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme (ETS) distinguishes between pre-1990 forest land and post-1989 forest land, 1990 being the base year of measurement under the Paris agreement, The scheme places mandatory deforestation obligations on exotic forests that were first established before 1990, referred to as ‘pre-1990 forests’. This means if pre-1990 landowners choose to deforest, for example when converting forest land to a different use, they face ‘deforestation liabilities’ under the ETS, have to report on emissions and surrender an equivalent amount of New Zealand emission units to the Government. When the ETS was introduced, owners of ‘pre-1990 forests’, were able to apply for a one-off free allocation of New Zealand emissions units. This allocation was intended to recognise the possible impact o n land values due to the cost New Zealand’s ETS places on deforesting, and the resulting reduction in land-use flexibility. A wide variety of owners applied for the free units, including farmers with small forest holdings, regional councils, owners of large commercial forests, and Māori entities who received forest land as part of treaty settlements. In total, nearly 48 million pre-1990 units were issued, 38 million of which are still held today, some of which have been either sold or surrendered. The t ax treatment also distinguishes between pre-1990 forestry emissions units and post-1989 forestry emissions units. As a transitional measure, the first disposal of emissions units by taxpayers who received the initial allocation of pre-1990 emission units is not treated as income under the Income Tax Act. Subsequent transactions are subject to normal tax treatment on disposal. The special tax treatment for pre-1990 emission units reflects the transitional nature of those units under the ETS, as outlined above. Public information on the use of pre-1990 forestry emissions units suggests that a large proportion are held long-term. As the units themselves do not produce income, the cash value of these assets can only be realised on disposal. For holders that want to take a long-term inter-generational approach, the units can represent an unproductive asset. The Inland Revenue Department (Inland Revenue) was approached by a private sector stakeholder about changing the Income Tax Act so that unit holders could extract value from the emission units using sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements without triggering a sale for tax purposes. Sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements It is a well-established principle of interpretation that the tax treatment of a transaction follows its legal form. When a taxpayer sells property, such as pre-1990 forestry emission units, with a compulsory obligation to buy the same or equivalent property back, the tax rules treat the transaction as a disposal – that is, the taxpayer alienates all rights in the property. By treating the sale and compulsory buy-back arrangement as a disposal for tax purposes, taxpayers extinguish the benefit of the tax transitional treatment for pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Economically, however, the transaction is a loan or lease of property. As the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 97 of 107 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 4 tax treatment follows the legal form of the transaction rather than its economic substance, tax law can act as an impediment to unit holders seeking to extract value from emissions units that are held for inter-generational purposes. Agreements involving the sale and compulsory buy back of property are typically referred to as “securitization”. Securitization usually involves using a long-term asset as security in return for a payment for up to the asset’s worth that is repayable at a specified later date. The borrower can use the asset for the period but the expectation is that the asset or an asset of an equivalent nature will be returned to the lender when the monies are paid back. As the set of transactions is in-substance a loan or lease, the tax consequences should follow the difference in the net cash flows as a measure of income, expenditure or loss arising from the arrangement. A netting approach is more consistent with existing tax policy frameworks when economic ownership of the asset is not surrendered. Case for change The approach to Inland Revenue for legislative reform was motivated by a unit holder wanting to enter into a significant transaction that would allow them to lend the emissions units to a third party who will likely use the units to offset liabilities connected with their emissions. Because the agreement requires the unit holder to reacquire the units at a specified future date, the property rights in the units cannot be said to have been extinguished or disposed of. In return for the emissions units, the unit holders would receive monies that could be used to produce income, such as interest. Tax law, however, inhibits such arrangements as they would result in the pre-1990 forestry emissions units losing their one-off tax-free status, and limits options for unit holders to seek opportunities to maximise the value from otherwise unproductive assets on their balance sheet. Work on the issue was initially planned for late 2018. However, an impetus for dealing with this issue more quickly is the fact that the stakeholder who approached Inland Revenue is planning to enter into a sale and buyback transaction of pre-1990 forestry emissions units by the end of May 2018. In the absence of the proposed change, the transaction is unlikely to take place. There is high confidence in the evidence and assumptions underpinning the case for change. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The key group of taxpayers affected by the change are holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Preliminary indications from this group, via targeted consultation with a selected group of unit holders with an interest in inter-generational asset retention and growth, were supportive of any reform that would allow them to maximise value from these units without losing any tax transitional benefits. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 98 of 107 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 5 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Tax issues with securitization of assets are not isolated to pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Other assets that could be securitised can be similarly affected, but reforming tax law generally for all assets at this stage has a risk of unintended consequences. Inland Revenue does not have sufficient evidence at this time to advance regulatory reform, even at an in- principle level, for the treatment of long term assets that are not pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Developing a response for pre-1990 forestry emission units only at this time is a reflection of the constraints on our analysis. The wider issues concerning the securitization of assets are scheduled to be considered as part of the review of the financial arrangement rules as announced as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 99 of 107 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 6 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The main objective is to ensure that the tax system recognises the economic substance of arrangements that securitise pre-1990 forestry emissions units and ensures that tax law does not inhibit opportunities to maximise the value of those units. The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Effectiveness: the options should not act as a disincentive for holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to maximise value from those units. • Sustainability: the options should maintain the integrity of the income tax, and operate coherently with the frameworks used by the Income Tax Act. • Fairness: the options should apply equally to all taxpayers. Like-transactions should have similar or equivalent tax outcomes. • Administration efficiency and compliance efficiency: the option should not introduce new processes or procedures that would not otherwise arise under the Income Tax Act. As the obligations, rights and entitlements of taxpayers are prescribed by legislation, non- legislative responses, apart from the status quo (which does not meet the main objective), are not viable. Effectiveness was the most important criterion at it aligned closest with the main objective. There was little difference between the options in terms of impact on compliance and administration efficiencies. Option one: Status quo Under the status quo, the sale and compulsory buy-back arrangement is treated as a disposal for tax purposes and taxpayers lose the benefit of the tax transitional treatment for pre-1990 forestry emissions units. Current tax policy settings inhibit unit holders from maximising the value of pre-1990 forestry emissions units unless they are sold. As such, the option is not effective and does not meet the main objective. The status quo is consistent with interpretation principles insofar as the Income Tax Act applies to transactions involving the transfer of property. As such, the status quo is arguably fair. Officials are aware, however, that broader concerns have been expressed that the current position is not sustainable and for this reason the tax treatment of sale and compulsory buy- back arrangements is part of a proposed review of the financial arrangement rules on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Option two: Apply the principles of the financial arrangement rules to securitised pre- 1990 forestry emissions unit transactions Under option two the securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units would be treated as a financial arrangement under the Income Tax Act. The financial arrangement rules tax all returns on financial arrangements on an accrual basis over the term of the arrangement, including the returns on instruments that can alter the incidence of those returns. Tax outcomes under the financial arrangement rules would align with the economic substance of Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 100 of 107 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 7 the securitization arrangement. This outcome means that option two is effective for the purpose of meeting unit holder expectations regarding their tax obligations and preserves the special tax transitional treatment of pre-1990 forestry emission units until such time as the unit holder choses to alienate their rights to the units. Option two uses existing tax frameworks in the Income Tax Act and is sustainable because it maintains the integrity of the tax base by ensuring that interest cash flows created by the arrangement are appropriately taxed. Option two does not rely on the creation of new frameworks and does not create any new or additional compliance or administration costs and meets the administration and compliance cost efficiency criterion. This option could result in market changes regarding the supply and demand of pre-1990 forestry emissions. Commoditizing such emissions units improves market liquidity but also introduces market risk (such as price and counter party default). We expect that holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units would carry out appropriate due diligence before entering into any sale and compulsory buy-back arrangements to mitigate these risks. The option does not fully meet the fairness criterion as it applies to pre-1990 forestry emissions units only. The fairness criterion would be fully met if the proposed approach applied to emissions units generally. Widening the scope of option two is not preferred at this time although officials will be considering in the coming months whether it would be desirable to also include post-1989 forestry emissions units in the proposed amendment prior to the legislation being introduced late this year. Originally, Inland Revenue had intended to discuss the securitization of emissions units in an officials’ issues paper for later in 2018. However, the impetus for dealing with pre-1990 forestry emissions units more quickly is the fact that a key stakeholder is planning to enter into a sale and buy-back transaction at the end of May 2018 and has sought an assurance from Ministers that there is support for legislative change to the Income Tax Act to ensure that tax law reflects the economic substance of the transaction. Preliminary feedback from stakeholders has been supportive of option two. Other options: Apply the principles of the share lending rules to pre-1990 forestry emissions units Other options were briefly considered. For example, the share lending rules which are based on a similar securitization concept. Share lending involves the lending of shares to another party for a fee. The share lending rules in the Income Tax Act tax transactions on the basis of economic substance rather than legal form. The share lending rules met some of the evaluation criteria (effectiveness, and administration and compliance efficiency) but did not adequately reflect the underlying cash flows under this particular type of securitization arrangement as the share lending rules are specifically targeted to shares. Therefore, it was dismissed as an option as it was not sustainable, notwithstanding its effectiveness. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory impact assessments Page 101 of 107 Securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units Impact Summary Template | 8 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option two, which relies on the principles and framework of the financial arrangement rules in the Income Tax Act to appropriately tax securitization arrangements involving pre-1990 forestry emissions units. This option is preferred as it meets the main objective and is effective and sustainable. By using existing frameworks in the Income Tax Act, it does not create new compliance or administrative processes. The proposed approach has no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems.

Inland Revenue officials are aware that a review of the emissions trading scheme is currently underway. The proposed approach is not anticipated to have any impacts on the outcome of this review. To provide certainty for stakeholders, the proposed approach would apply from the start of the 2018-19 income year for transactions entered into from that year. Applying the change from this time gives assurance and certainty to the stakeholder (and others) who initially raised concerns that the Income Tax Act was limiting opportunities for holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to maximise the value of those assets.

The problem with the current tax rules as they apply to securitization of pre-1990 forestry emissions units was brought to Inland Revenue’s attention by a specific taxpayer. Taxpayer secrecy prevents Inland Revenue from naming this taxpayer. The taxpayer has been consulted throughout the policy development process. Inland Revenue also undertook targeted in- confidence consultation, via letter, with a selection of the larger holders of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to test initial reactions to the proposed approach. The letter sought stakeholder views about the proposed change. Feedback supported a change from the status quo. Inland Revenue also carried out follow up contact via telephone with stakeholders. Their feedback was very positive. One submitter suggested the amendment should extend to the securitization of any forestry emissions units, not just pre-1990 forestry emissions units. The submitter’s point is that owners of post-1989 forestry emissions units tend to retain them to cover the future surrender obligations that arise under the emissions trading scheme when the forests are harvested. Being able to securitize those units in the meantime would be useful for the owners of post- 1989 forestry emissions units. Over the coming months Inland Revenue will consider and report back to Ministers on whether the proposed amendment should be extended to all emissions units, or alternatively, whether any extension should be left to be considered as part of the financial arrangements issues paper. This consideration should not, however, hold up obtaining Cabinet agreement to a legislative tax amendment for pre-1990 forest land emissions units. More generally, Inland Revenue considers any wider securitisation issues should be considered as part of the proposed review of the taxation of financial arrangements, which is planned for later in 2018. The outcome of this review is not expected to result in changes that would be inconsistent with the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary. Separate from the review of the taxation of financial arrangements, an additional round of consultation is proposed about the detailed design of the proposed approach before final policy decisions are made by Ministers. Cabinet is being asked to delegate authority to the Minister of Revenue to finalise the detailed design of the proposed approach. Another round of consultation will also be available as part of Parliament’s consideration of any legislative amendment through the Parliamentary select committee process. The Treasury was consulted as part of the policy development process and supports the measure being taken to Cabinet for approval. The Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry for the Environment and the Office of Treaty Settlements were also consulted and did not identify any concerns with the proposed approach.

Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 is necessary to implement option two. These amendments would be included in an omnibus taxation bill planned for later in 2018 . The changes would apply to securitization transactions entered into by taxpayers from the 2018-19 and later income years. Stakeholder feedback has not highlighted any concerns regarding compliance with the proposed approach and it has been positively received. When the bill is introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be concurrently released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin series, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that the proposed approach can be implemented and made effective for transactions entered into anytime from the start of the 2018-19 income year.

Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes as per the objectives of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that the proposed approach meets its objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Monitoring of the proposed approach will be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? A proposed review of the financial arrangement rules is on the Government’s tax policy work programme for later 2018. It will consider a variety of financial arrangement taxation issues ranging from remedial to policy enhancements to ensure the rules work as intended. This review will ultimately involve the preparation of a public consultation document and the opportunity for stakeholders to comment. Any concerns identified by stakeholders about the proposed approach discussed in this Impact Summary, including its possible extension to other assets, would be considered as part of this review.

Impact Summary: Fringe benefit tax on employment related loans – Market interest rate Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be undertaken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Quality of data used for impact analysis Inland Revenue does not possess information on how much FBT paid by banks and other money lenders relates to employment related loans. Therefore, stakeholders were asked to self-report how much FBT they pay on employment related loans and this information was used to estimate the amount of FBT currently collected on employment related loans from banks and other money lenders. Consultation and testing Although there was only a short consultation period, by targeting consultation to relevant stakeholders, Inland Revenue is confident that it got the input it needed to inform the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 March 2018 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? FBT rules A fringe benefit arises when an employer provides a loan to an employee. There are two ways in which the benefit of an employment related loan can be valued. Most employers are required to use a prescribed rate of interest as defined in section RD 34 on the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act). The prescribed interest rate is adjusted from time to time by Order in Council and is based on the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate published by the Reserve Bank. However, employers that are in the business of lending money, or are a member of a group of companies with at least one member in the business of lending money, may instead elect to use the market interest rate as defined in section RD 35 of the Act. If they have elected to use the market rate, banks and other employers in the business of lending money are required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) when they provide a loan to an employee at a rate below the market interest rate. The market interest rate for a group of employees is currently defined as the rate their employer would offer to an arm’s length group of persons with a comparable credit risk to the group of employees. Different money lenders will therefore have different market rates as the market rate is based on the rates a given lender offers to a group of its customers with a common risk profile. The market interest rate rules were based on the practices banks and other lenders were using at the time the rules were developed. Money lenders would advertise rates and, in general, customers would receive these rates if they met the necessary conditions for a loan. However, some lenders would also offer discounts to certain groups of customers. For example a bank may have offered employees of a local respected employer a discount of 0.3 percentage points below the advertised rates. The market interest rate rules allow either a money lender’s advertised rates or any group discount rates the money lender offers to be offered to employees as the market interest rate without banks and other similar lenders incurring FBT. FBT should only be payable on employment related loans when a discount is genuinely provided to an employee. Problem The method for calculating the market rate is out-dated and no longer reflects the lending practices of banks and other money lenders. It is now common practice for banks and other similar lenders to individually negotiate loan rates with customers. Banks and other money lenders now also consider a broader range of criteria than just credit risk when determining interest rates. Individually negotiated loans cannot be used for determining the market rate as the rates received by customers through this process have not been offered to a group. As such, the true market rate, being the interest rate an arm’s length customer receives, is often lower than the market rate calculated under the current legislation. This can result in the over-taxation of employment related loans and fairness concerns. Furthermore, because Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 of this over-taxation many employees of banks and other money lenders may be able to receive better loan rates from competitors to their employer. The rules around the market interest rate were introduced to rectify the problem of FBT ari sing even when the employer is charging an employee the true market rate. As such, changing the method for calculating the market rate to more appropriately reflect the true market rate would be consistent with the original policy intent and the broader FBT policy framework. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are banks and other employers in the business of lending money as well as the employees of money lenders. Banks and other money lenders are affected as they are currently paying too much FBT on loans made to employees. Employees are affected as the interest rates they receive from their employer may in some cases not be as low as if the over-taxation of employment related loans did not occur. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There are no constraints on the scope for decision making. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options: • Effectiveness: the option should only result in FBT being payable when a discount is genuinely provided to an employee in order to ensure fairness. • Compliance: compliance costs for banks and other employers in the business of lending money should be minimised. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised. • Certainty: the option should provide certainty as to how to calculate the market rate. Option one: Status quo Under the status quo the market interest rate for a given employee is defined as the rate a bank (or other money lender) would offer to a group of persons when: • The group has a comparable credit risk to the group which the employee belongs to; and • Membership of the group arises from a factor or factors that do not include a connection between a member and the employer; and • The group is sufficient in number to ensure a transaction on an arm’s length basis. The main issue with the status quo is its effectiveness. Under the status quo, FBT is often payable even when an employee is receiving the same interest rate they would have received as an arm’s length customer and this leads to fairness concerns. Under the status quo, compliance and administration costs are relatively low and money lenders do have certainty around how to calculate the market rate. Option two: The market rate is the lowest rate given to an arm’s length customer The option is that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar profile (based on the lending criteria used by the employer) to the employee. Under this option, banks and other money lenders would have a choice about what time period they calculate the market rate from. Ideally, money lenders would calculate the market rate based on loans given to arm’s length customers in the same FBT quarter as loans made to employees. However, money lenders that do not have readily available data from the current FBT quarter may instead elect to calculate the market rate using data from the FBT quarter immediately prior to the FBT quarter in which an employee received a loan. This option has been consulted on with the New Zealand Banker’s Association, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and the Financial Services Council. All Submissions received were supportive of updating how the market rate is calculated and this option. Effectiveness This option would prevent the over-taxation of employment related loans that occurs under the status quo. Instead, loans made to employees would only be subject to FBT if a genuine Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 discount compared to the rates received by arm’s length customers has been provided. Compliance Consultation has indicated that this option would have relatively low compliance costs that are comparable to the status quo. This option would simply require them to identify the lowest rate offered over the relevant time period and apply this as the market rate. Administration This option would have administration costs for Inland Revenue that are comparable to the status quo. Certainty This option would provide certainty for money lenders on how to calculate the market rate. However, submissions did ask for further guidance on when a loan made to a customer was made in the ordinary course of business. This will be provided as part of the bill commentary and in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Option three: Employers using the market rate can make an election between using the either the status quo or option two for calculating the market rate (proposed option) This option is that option two would be introduced alongside the status quo. Banks and other money lenders would be given the choice to use either method for calculating the market rate. The method proposed under option two for calculating the market rate will be more taxpayer favourable than the status quo, so we expect most banks and other money lenders to use this method. However, it is possible that some money lenders may not have the data capabilities available to readily determine the lowest rate given to arm’s length customers in either the current or previous FBT quarter. Allowing these employers to still use the status quo method for calculating the market interest rate would ensure they would not be disadvantaged by the introduction of the method proposed under option two. Effectiveness As stated above, for employers that choose to use the new method this option would prevent the over-taxation of employment related loans that occurs under the status quo. Compliance As above. Administration As above. Certainty As above. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 Option four: Market rate is the average rate given to arm’s length customers This option is that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the average rate given around the same time to arm’s length customers with a similar risk profile to the employee. This option has been consulted on; however submitters were overwhelmingly opposed to this option. This is because this option would still result in some over-taxation of employment related loans. Other options A number of other options were considered but were not consulted on as they would not be feasible and would not provide certainty around how to calculate the market rate. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option three which introduces an additional option for calculating the market rate along with the status quo calculation. The additional option defines the market rate for a given employee and loan type as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar profile to the employee. This is the preferred approach as it would effectively address the over-taxation that occurs under the status quo without increasing compliance or administration costs. This option would also provide certainty to money lenders on how to calculate the market interest rate, while leaving them the choice of still using the status quo calculation if they wish. The proposed approach has no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems.

Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) Administration costs of proposed approach are comparable to status quo.

Low Total Monetised Benefit $3m per annum Non-monetised benefits Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? It is assumed that the entirety of the $3 million in FBT currently paid by banks and other money lenders for employment related loans will be foregone if the issue is effectively addressed. This is based on discussions with stakeholders in which they have claimed they generally treat employees no different from arm’s length customers when offering loans. We do not anticipate the proposed approach would have any other impacts. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? This problem was initially brought to Inland Revenue’s attention by members of the New Zealand Bankers’ Association (NZBA) and they have been consulted throughout the policy development process. A targeted consultation letter was recently sent to the NZBA as well as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) and the Financial Services Council. The consultation letter asked for their views on options two (the lowest rate) and four (the average rate). The letter also asked for views on whether any new method for calculating the market rate should replace the status quo or be in addition to it. Submissions from CA ANZ, CTG and a number of banks were received. All submissions received were supportive of updating the market interest rate definition and the approach proposed under option two. Submissions were not supportive of option four as it would not fully address the problem and would be difficult to comply with. Most submissions were also supportive of the new option being introduced as an addition the status quo. As such, it was decided to introduce option two as an option alongside the status quo. As a result of stakeholder feedback the proposed approach has been modified. The original option two was that the market interest rate for a given employee and loan type would be defined as the lowest rate given around the same time in the ordinary course of business to an arm’s length customer with a similar risk profile to the employee. Banks pointed out that risk profile is only one factor out of many they consider in offering loans and determining interest rates. Therefore, using similar profile as opposed to similar risk profile for comparing employees to arm’s length customers is more likely to provide the correct result. The Treasury has also been consulted on the proposed approach and supports the proposed changes subject to consideration of how to prioritise this issue alongside other issues. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposal will require amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, currently scheduled for introduction in May 2018. The changes would come into effect from the start of the first FBT quarter after the bill is passed into law. It is anticipated this would be 1 April 2019. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts, and consider that they would be manageable to implement in the proposed timeframe. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Monitoring the impact of the new arrangements will be done through consultation with the New Zealand Bankers’ Association and other relevant stakeholders. Given the relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders we would also expect stakeholders to raise any issues they experience directly with us. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. If the post-implementation review identifies any need for remedial action it would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme and could potentially be included in future taxation bills.

Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with changes to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Scoping of the problems The problems were identified as part of the Retirement Commissioner’s December 2016 review of retirement income policies (the Review) – which wa s prepared by the Commission for Financial Capability. Therefore, the problems were effectively already identified before Inland Revenue began work on the proposed regulatory approaches. Range of options considered As the problems were identified as part of the Review, the options considered were also based on the recommendations made in the Review. The Retirement Commissioner has a legislative mandate to review retirement income policies every three years, as a result the Commission for Financial Capability is experienced in considering ways to improve the effectiveness of retirement income policies (including KiwiSaver). The recommendations in the Review were made after problem definitions and solutions had been tested with the public, the private sector and Government agencies during 2016. (This consultation involved interviews with the public, a range of online surveys taken by approximately 11,200 members of the public and consideration of substantive written submissions). 1 The nature of the Commission for Financial Capability’s expertise and the significant scoping done as part of the Review indicates that the recommendation s it proposed are likely to be the most viable options to address the problems it had identified. Quality of data used for impact analysis It is not possible to accurately determine how many KiwiSaver members will be encouraged by the proposed approaches to increase their contributions and therefore their long-term 1 Surveys were available on the Commission for Financial Capability’s website. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 1 KiwiSaver savings. However, results of a public survey undertaken as part of the Review generally signalled support for the recommendations. 2 The estimated impacts of the proposed options are dependent on the behavioural response of KiwiSaver members. Previous changes to the scheme have been more restrictive in nature, so cannot be used as a basis for predicting responses to the proposals. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis Both proposals assume KiwiSaver members would be responsive when presented with voluntary (rather than compulsory) options that increase their long-term savings. Responsible Manager: Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 1 March 2018 2 Out of 1,830 survey responses, 85.4 percent of respondents were in support of more flexible contribution rates while 51.6 percent of respondents supported reducing the maximum period of a contributions holiday from five years to one year. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The KiwiSaver Act 2006 sets out the requirements for KiwiSaver members and their employers. Under the KiwiSaver policy framework, although KiwiSaver remains voluntary, contributions are encouraged in several ways. For example, employees’ contributions are facilitated by being deducted directly from their pay (if the employer receives a deduction notice from the member or Inland Revenue), and members are incentivised to make contributions to their KiwiSaver account so they receive the Government subsidised member tax credit (an annual maximum payment of $521.43, to members who contribute upwards of $1,042.86). This regulatory impact analysis deals with two specific problems: Part A problem – low employee contribution rates Currently, KiwiSaver members have contributions deducted at a rate of 3% (the minimum default rate), 4% or 8% from their salary and wages. Approximately 90 percent of members were contributing at the lowest 3% or 4% employee contribution rates in the 2016-17 year. Population demographics are changing, with New Zealander’s living longer into retirement. Life expectancy for New Zealand females is 83.2 years and 79.5 years for males, 3 with these numbers expected to continue to rise. The Review signalled that KiwiSaver members contributing at a low rate, may not have accumulated sufficient savings to financially support themselves during the entire duration of their retirement, in a way that meets their individual retirement needs and preferences. Part B problem – long contributions holidays For the year ending 31 June 2017 131,710 members were on a contributions holiday, with 84 percent of these contribution holidays being five years in duration (contribution holidays can be for any period between three months and five years, five years is the default period). This means these members were not making contributions, or were only making minimal voluntary lump sum contributions during this period (voluntary contributions are generally not at the level the member would have saved were they not on a contributions holiday). Stopping contributions for five years has a significant impact on members’ savings, and also means members generally do not receive the member tax credit or employer contributions during this period. The purpose of the contributions holiday is to ensure members can take a break from making contributions when they are not in a financial position to do so. However, having a default five year contributions holiday period is likely to be longer than necessary for many members (whose financial position is likely to improve in the interim period). 3 Statistics New Zealand ‘New Zealand Period Life Tables: 2012-14’ Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 3 Who should address the problems and when? KiwiSaver is the only Government subsided retirement savings scheme offered to the public. Therefore, the Government has a responsibility to ensure it is fit for purpose. This should include making sure members are given as many options as possible to effectively save. These problems should be addressed now. They were identified as part of the December 2016 Review. It would be prudent for the Government to respond to problems identified in the Review within a reasonable timeframe, because the longer that nothing is done to address the problems, the more savings KiwiSaver members potentially lose out on. The problem definitions and recommendations in the Review were formed after consultation with the public, the private sector and Government agencies, meaning there is agreement across a variety of sectors that the problems are an issue. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Part A problem – low employee contribution rates KiwiSaver members (who are salary and wage earners) who are not contributing enough to their KiwiSaver account to meet their specific retirement preferences would be affected. The aim of this change is to get these members to start contributing at a higher rate, in a manner that is still flexible enough to respond to changes in their financial circumstances . The purpose of this is to increase KiwiSaver members’ retirement savings, so that they can achieve retirement outcomes aligned with their specific retirement needs. The proposed option would address this problem by introducing additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates. KiwiSaver scheme providers and other Government agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver (MBIE and the Treasury) support this option. This approach should not have financial implications for the Government. Part B problem – long contributions holidays KiwiSaver members (who are salary and wage earners) who are taking breaks due to contributions holidays would be affected. The aim of this change being to prompt members to resume making contributions sooner, so that they increase their savings and maximise their member tax credit entitlement (which they would not receive while contributions are paused). The proposed option would reduce the maximum period of the contributions holiday from five years to one year. This would limit the time during which members make no contributions (it would still be possible for members to indefinitely renew contributions holidays, but they will have to do so more frequently, ensuring they actively consider the matter). KiwiSaver scheme providers and other Government agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver also support this option. There may be some cost to the Government. If reducing the contributions holiday has the desired effect and results in members resuming contributions earlier, this would result in an increase in the aggregate amount of member tax credits payable. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 4 The majority of the administrative costs for implementing the proposed approaches to address the problems would be borne by Inland Revenue and could be accommodated in existing baselines. There would not be any significant compliance cost for scheme providers or employers. There is not known to be any group that does not support the proposed approaches. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Constraints As the problems were identified by the Review, the options in scope to address them have been limited to the recommendations made in the Review. However, t he Retirement Commissioner’s experience in considering the effectiveness of retirement income policies, as well as the consultation process undertaken as part of the Review to identify problems and solutions (as outlined in more detail above), suggest the recommendations made in the Review are likely to be the most appropriate options to address the problems. The previous Government approved its letter of response to the Review for public release in May 2017. As part of the process of inputting into this letter of response Inland Revenue officials considered how effectively the options outlined below would address the problems. When it approved the release of the letter of response to the Review, the previous Government also invited the Minister of Revenue to report back to Cabinet specifically on implementation details for: • providing additional optional employee contribution rates; • reducing the maximum permitted renewal time of the contributions holiday; and • changing the name of the “contributions holiday” to “savings suspension”. Connections to other existing issues At the time of writing this regulatory impact analysis Cabinet were also considering: • a change to the name of the contributions holiday; • a change to the name of the member tax credit; and • consequential issues related to the previous Government’s decision that over 65 year olds should be eligible to join KiwiSaver. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Part A deals with low employee contribution rates and aims to get these members to start contributing at a higher rate, in a manner that is still flexible enough to respond to changes in their financial circumstances. Part B aims to prompt members to resume making contributions sooner, so that they increase their savings. In contributing to the Government response to the 2016 Review Inland Revenue conducted a high-level assessment of the options to the two problems using the following criteria: • Effectiveness: the option must address the problems in a manner that is appropriate within wider KiwiSaver policy settings. • Compliance: compliance cost for employers and KiwiSaver members should be minimised. • Administration: implementation and administration costs for Government departments should be minimised. • Equity: as far as practical the option should be available to all KiwiSaver members. Part A problem Four options are considered for dealing with low employee contribution rates. Option one: Add additional employee contribution rates of 6% and 10% Effectiveness Additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates are likely to have a positive impact on savings, and would give members greater flexibility to achieve retirement outcomes aligned with their specific retirement savings needs and to adjust their contribution rate to suit their current financial circumstances. The additional 6% rate would also address the gap between the current 4% and 8% contribution rates, which the Review indicated many members think is too large. This view is supported by the fact that 24 percent of members contribute at the 4% rate, but only 9 percent of members contribute at the 8% rate. 4 Compliance Members would have to self-select onto one of the new employee contribution rates (as members wanting to contribute at 4% or 8% currently have to). Employee deductions would continue to be made out of members’ salary or wages, meaning there would be no on-going additional compliance costs for employees. The range of rates at which employers would be required to deduct contributions from employees’ salary or wages would increase. This could result in a small increase in compliance costs for employers not using a commercial payroll system. Administration This option would require building additional employee contribution rates into Inland 4 The other 67 percent of members contribute at the minimum 3% rate. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 6 Revenue’s administrative system. However, this impact would be a one-off cost. Equity Members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to self-select onto a high rate than lower salary and wage earners. As the additional contribution rates are voluntary their introduction would not result in lower income earners being financially worse off as a result of them. Option two: Add automated option to allow members to increase their contribution rate over time Under this option members would choose an automated annual increase in their contribution rate of 0.25%, 0.5% or 1% up to a capped maximum rate. Effectiveness This option would provide more flexible contribution rates. This could have a positive impact on savings, as well as allowing members to personalise their contribution rate more specifically to their retirement savings needs. Compliance As contribution rates would automatically increase members would not be required to self- select onto a higher contributions rate which could be seen as a reduction in compliance costs. However, this option would significantly increase compliance costs for employers, and could require them to modify their payroll systems. The automated contribution rates could also be complex for payroll and software providers to implement in the first instance. The automated rates would also add complexity to KiwiSaver rules, which could be difficult for scheme providers to explain to members. Administration Introducing increasing contribution rates which are not whole numbers would require changes to Inland Revenue systems and could be difficult to administer. Equity There is a possible inequity, in that members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to choose to annually increase their contribution rate. However, as the automated annual increases would be voluntary their introduction would not result in lower income earners being financially worse off. Option three: Increase the minimum employer and employee contribution rate from 3% to 4% Effectiveness This option would result in a compulsory increase in costs for KiwiSaver members and employers contributing to KiwiSaver. This could detrimentally impact on members and employers’ current financial position and short-term savings. We note there is limited evidence this recommendation would raise savings rates (as it may result in KiwiSaver Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 7 members substituting away from other savings). Compliance Employee deductions would continue to be made out of members’ salary or wages, meaning there would be no additional compliance costs for employees. The minimum rate employers would be required to deduct contributions from employees’ salary and wages would increase. This could result in a one-off increase in compliance costs for employers not using a commercial payroll system. Administrative This option would require changes to Inland Revenue’s administrative processes for validating minimum contribution rates. However, these impacts are likely to be small and one-off in nature. Equity This option would make it more difficult for low-income earners to contribute to KiwiSaver. This could adversely impact whether they are in a financial position to adequately support themselves in the short term or alternatively it could force members to go on a contributions holiday (and therefore negatively impact on their long-term savings). Option four: Status quo Effectiveness The status quo does not address the problem, as it does not give members the opportunity to self-select onto new higher contributions rates and therefore it is unlikely to have any positive impact on members’ long term savings. It also does not give members more flexibility to personalise the amount they contribute to align with their retirement savings needs. Compliance There would be no additional compliance costs. Administration There would be no additional administrative costs. Equity Members on a higher salary or wage are more likely to be in a financial position to self-select onto a high rate than lower salary and wage earners. Notably the gap in affordability between the 4% and 8% rate is a financial obstacle preventing many members from contributing at a higher rate. If members are not in a financial position to opt onto a higher contribution rate, it would mean these members would not have the opportunity to save more for their retirement. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 8 Part B problem Two options are considered for dealing with long contributions holidays. Option One: Reduce the maximum contributions holiday period from five years to one year Under this option the maximum length of a contributions holiday would be one year. Contributions would automatically resume after the one year, unless the member renewed their contributions holiday for another year. Effectiveness Although some members on a contribution holiday continue to make lump sum contributions, stopping regular contributions for five years is likely to significantly impact on members’ long- term savings. Reducing the maximum period from five years to one year encourages members to more frequently re-engage with KiwiSaver and to assess whether they are in a position to resume making contributions. Compliance Members wanting to remain on a contribution holiday would have to renew their holiday each year rather than every five years, resulting in a small increase in compliance costs. Administration This option would require Inland Revenue to contact members on a contributions holiday more frequently. This would result in an on-going increase in the resources Inland Revenue would need to allocate to processing contribution holiday renewals. This impact would be manageable, and the on-going administrative cost of renewing contributions holidays could be reduced once KiwiSaver is transferred into the new START system, as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. Equity Members on a contributions holiday because of financial hardship are unlikely to be in a position to resume contributions after a year. Therefore, this option would only benefit members whose financial position had improved since going on a contributions holiday. If, at the expiry of the shortened holiday period the member’s financial situation has not improved they could still renew their holiday, but this option would ensure that they actively consider their financial position on a more regular basis. As part of the detailed design of this option, transitional arrangements would be put in place for members on a contributions holiday longer than a year when the reduced period comes into effect. This would ensure these members would be entitled to complete the duration of their existing contributions holiday under the rules that applied when they opted to go on a holiday. The proposal potentially creates an equity issue between members (in otherwise identical situations) applying for a contributions holiday prior to this change being enacted and those applying after this change is enacted. However, as transitional arrangements would only apply until members completed an existing contributions holiday there would not be an on- Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 9 going equity concern (beyond five years). Option two: Status quo Effectiveness The status quo does not address the problem. Going on a five year contributions holiday is likely to significantly impact on members’ savings. As members are not prompted to reconsider the length of their holiday during the five year period, it also means they could stay on a contributions holiday for longer than is financially necessary. Compliance There would be no additional compliance costs. Administration There would be no additional administrative impacts. Equity If members do not select a duration end date for their contributions holiday, the default five year period applies. As they are not prompted to reconsider whether they are in a financial position to resume making contributions during the five year period, they could continue to be on a contributions holiday when their current circumstances do not require it. Therefore, the long term savings of a member on a five year contributions holiday are more likely to be negatively impacted, than members on a contributions holiday who select a (shorter) duration end date. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 10 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Part A problem The proposed approach to address the problem of low contribution rates is to introduce additional 6% and 10% optional employee contribution rates. These additional rates would give members more flexibility to meet their specific retirement savings needs and have the potential to positively impact KiwiSaver members’ long term savings. A member with an annual gross income of $50,000 gains an additional $1,000 in savings by increasing their contribution rate from 4% to 6% or from 8% to 10% each year. As the additional rates are voluntary the current financial needs of low-income earners will not be adversely affected. Part B problem The proposed approach to address the problem of long contributions holidays is to reduce the maximum period of the contributions holiday from five years to one year. This approach would prompt members to reassess whether they were in a position to resume making contributions after one year rather than five years. For every additional year a member contributing at the default 3% rate with an annual gross income of $50,000 resumes contributions, they gain up to $3,258.93 in savings (including the full member tax credit and compulsory employer contributions). Members would still be able to renew their holiday if their financial circumstances continue to require it and members who do not use KiwiSaver as their primary retirement savings vehicle would not have to substitute away from their other savings. The proposed approaches are not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 11 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 5 Based on the 198,000 employers who filed with Inland Revenue in 2016. The 38 percent using a file transfer filing method use commercial payroll software, it is anticipated over half of the 34 percent of employers using an onscreen filing method also use commercial payroll software. Affected parties Comment: Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, employers) Part A Employers could see a marginal rise in compliance costs, as there would be additional rates at which employee contributions are made. It is estimated between 38 percent to 55 percent of employers use commercial payroll systems, 5 therefore it is anticipated these employers should not have difficulty with this. The additional rates would be a low level change for payroll system providers and should not be difficult for them to implement. Previous changes in contribution rates (such as the movement in the minimum rate from 4% to 2% and then 3%) have not caused significant issues for employers or payroll system providers. Part B Additional on-going compliance costs for members wanting to renew a contributions holiday, as they would have to actively consider renewal of their holiday each year, rather than every five years. Low Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) Communicating the proposed approaches to the public, employers and scheme providers would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $300,000. Part A Changes to Inland Revenue’s operational systems would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $90,000. Part B Changes to Inland Revenue’s operational systems would have an estimated one-off cost of up to $18,000. Having to renew members’ contributions holidays each year, rather than every five years, would also result in an increase in estimated on-going administrative cost One-off communication cost of up to $300,000. One-off implementation cost of up to $90,000. One-off implementation cost of up to $18,000. Administrative cost of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21. KiwiSaver is scheduled to Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 12 6 Based on number of people on a contributions holiday at 30 June 2017 and assumes each person would receive a member tax credit payment of $380.00 – the average member tax credit amount claimed by members on a contributions holiday (who were making voluntary contributions). for Inland Revenue of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21. be transferred into Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START) in 2020, which may reduce on- going delivery costs. Wider government Part A The additional rates should not have a fiscal impact (members earning an annual gross income of $26,071.50 contributing at the existing 4% rate contribute enough to receive the full member tax credit). Part B Assuming the proposed approach encourages members to come off contributions holidays earlier more members would be entitled to the member tax credit. Low If all members currently on a contributions holiday resumed making contributions the fiscal cost would be approximately $30 million. If only members on a five year holiday resumed contributions the fiscal cost would be approximately $23million. 6 Actual fiscal costs are likely to be significantly less, as costs would consistently decline based on the members on a contributions holiday that decided to renew their holiday. Other parties No other parties are impacted. No impact. Total Monetised Cost Administrative costs for Inland Revenue. One-off cost of $408,000, on-going cost of up to $71,000 for 2019-20 and $184,000 for 2020-21 period. Non-monetised costs Compliance costs on KiwiSaver members and employers and increase in member tax credit payable by the Government. Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members) Part A Additional 6% and 10% employee contribution rates could encourage members to self-select a higher rate and increase their savings. Low (as both Part A and Part B would be voluntary, the aggregate increase in members’ savings is difficult to predict). Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 13 Part B Reducing the maximum contributions holiday period to one year prompts members to reassess whether they are in a financial position to resume contributions.

Low Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 14 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The exact impact the proposed approaches would have on KiwiSaver member’s contribution behaviour cannot be anticipated. As the proposed changes are voluntary there is the risk they might not have the desired effect of increasing the amount KiwiSaver members are contributing. However, consultation and surveys undertaken as part of the Review suggested there was public support for the proposed approaches: • 85.6 percent of respondents were in support of more flexible contribution rates (the proposed approach to address low employee contribution rates); and • 51.6 percent of respondents supported reducing the maximum contributions holiday period (the proposed approach to address long contributions holidays). This suggests there should be a notable group of KiwiSaver members who would be responsive to the proposed approaches (particularly in respect of the approach to address low employee contribution rates). Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? As part of the previous Government’s response to the Review (which was co-ordinated by MBIE) the Treasury, MBIE, and MSD had the opportunity to express their views on the proposed approaches. Inland Revenue has also separately consulted with the agencies jointly responsible for KiwiSaver – MBIE and the Treasury, who agreed with the proposed approaches. Inland Revenue has consulted with KiwiSaver scheme providers, and they generally support the proposed approaches. A working group made up of representatives from 11 KiwiSaver scheme providers also made a written submission as part of the Review consultation process. Inland Revenue have not consulted further with employers or KiwiSaver members, relying instead on the public consultation which was undertaken as part of the Review - in the form of interviews, written submissions and surveys (approximately 11,200 surveys were completed on retirement income policy, with 1,830 of those being specifically on KiwiSaver). Members and employers would also have had the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed changes after the Government’s letter of response to the Review was released publicly. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 15 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus tax bill, currently scheduled for introduction in May 2018. The changes would come into effect onc e this bill has been enacted into law. It is anticipated this would be in early 2019. We are proposing that transitional arrangements be put in place for KiwiSaver members on contributions holidays of longer than a year, when the changes are enacted. These members would not be subject to the reduced maximum contribution holiday period, until their current contribution holiday expires. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue officials have assessed the magnitude of these administrative impacts, and consider that they would be manageable to implement in the proposed timeframe. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the contents of the proposed omnibus tax bill (including these proposals) when it is introduced in the House. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary: KiwiSaver enhancements resulting from the Retirement Commissioner’s review | 16 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Inland Revenue also currently collects data on members’ employee contribution rates and contributions holiday duration periods. This data could help inform an assessment of how many members’ contributions behaviour has changed as a result of the proposed approaches. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post- implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. As the Retirement Commissioner’s review of retirement income policies is conducted every three years, the next review in 2019 would also provide an opportunity to reflect on the level of support for the proposed approaches.

Impact Summary: Making Tax Simpler – Improvements to the administration of tax for individuals. Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue and Treasury are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The proposals were developed as part of the overall business transformation programme that Inland Revenue is currently working through; they build on other changes being made within that programme with a view to improving the overall administration of the New Zealand tax system by reducing compliance and administrative costs as well as looking to simplify the system for taxpayers and give them certainty about their obligations. As a result of the extensive public consultation there are few limitations or constraints on the analysis of the final proposals as there was a high level of engagement from stakeholders in the policy development process. There were, however, two constraints to the analysis of the financial impacts of the proposal: • For those taxpayers who have treated themselves as not being required to file tax returns under current law it has been assumed those individuals do not have other income that should have been separately returned to Inland Revenue. This may include rental income, dividend income or other non-source deducted income. It may be that those taxpayers should have been filing a tax return; and • For those who have used the correct tax code/rate and would therefore not be required to pay any resulting tax liability the analysis has been constrained by the frequency on which Inland Revenue currently receives that tax deduction data. It is currently received on a monthly or twice monthly basis whereas in the future this will be on a payday basis which should enable correct tax rates to be more accurately monitored. This limitation may suggest that tax rates are more or less correct than they actually are if more frequent information was used in the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 1 Mike Nutsford Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 14 March 2018 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 2 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The current law generally allows those taxpayers who derive only source deducted income (reportable income 1 ) not to file a tax return. However, the rules around when a person should file a return are not well understood by taxpayers. In addition, the current “non-filing” regime incentivises taxpayers to actively seek out tax refunds by filing a return and not returning when a debit arises, requiring them to determine if they are in an over-withheld or under-withheld position. The filing of a tax return can be difficult for individuals; many find it difficult to obtain and retain records relating to their income and the process of filing the return is seen as complex. Although Inland Revenue automatically releases refunds of less than $600 after a personal tax summary has been issued many taxpayers continue to engage intermediaries to determine whether they are due a tax refund. The more timely information that will shortly be received by Inland Revenue 2 from those who deduct tax at source will allow Inland Revenue to undertake more proactive actions to ensure that the level of withholding during the year is more accurate which should reduce the number and level of tax “square-ups” required at the end of the year. The changes proposed in this RIA build on this increased provision of information to, for most taxpayers, automatically calculate their year-end square up. This will either automatically send them a refund or a notice to pay under limited situations 3 . These changes will mean that approximately three million taxpayers will have their tax position automatically dealt with and save these people either having to file a return, engage with a tax agent to receive a refund or interact with Inland Revenue to determine their own tax position (either through MyIR 4 or by phone). The proposals will also simplify the claiming of donation tax credits 5 by moving these into the income tax return process and allowing taxpayers to supply receipts during the year through an on-line portal rather than at the end of the year when receipts may have been misplaced. The counterfactual to the proposal is to leave the current rules in place and although Inland Revenue could still be more pro-active during the year to reduce any over or under payments there will be no corresponding reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers at the end of the year to determine whether they are due a tax refund or there is a balance to pay. The proposal will decrease these compliance costs and deliver any refunds directly to taxpayers without any cost to them. 1 Reportable income is income that has tax deducted at source. This includes income from employment, interest, dividends, Mãori Authority distributions and employee share scheme benefits. 2 Due to changes to information gathering contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill 3 These will only be issued where the tax liability is over a $20 threshold or where the person has advised their correct tax code or rate but that tax has not been deducted correctly. 4 MyIR – is Inland Revenue’s web based platform. 5 A tax credit against taxable income is available for donations of $5 or more to approved organisations. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 3 The proposals in this RIA align with the information gathering changes contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017- 18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill and as a consequence to obtain full benefit of the proposals they need to be implemented at the same time, starting 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 tax year. In addition the timing of the introduction of these new rules is aligned to release three of the business transformation programme which will enable these changes to be implemented at the same time individuals’ income tax is brought within the new START 6 computer system. This release is scheduled for April 2019. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The proposals will affect the approximately three million taxpayers who currently only derive reported income. It will enable those taxpayers who are overtaxed for some reason to directly receive their refund without having to engage with Inland Revenue or an intermediary no matter what the level of that refund rather than being restricted to refunds less than $600. For those who have an underpayment in certain, limited, circumstances they will receive a notification of any debt. However, those taxpayers who have had tax withheld in accordance with the deduction rules will not have to pay any resulting shortfall. The proposal will reduce taxpayer compliance costs in having to determine their final tax position and obtain any associated refund. It will be paid in full to them automatically notwithstanding the level of that refund. It will also simplify the claiming of donation tax credits and allow taxpayers to supply receipts during the year instead of having to retain these and claim them at the end of the year. Again this will assist people in claiming tax credits for donations and bring these within the automatic square up process for year-end for most taxpayers. Officials consider these proposals, in conjunction with the increased levels of proactive actions Inland Revenue will take based on more frequent income information, very beneficial for the affected taxpayers. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There have been no constraints on the scope for decision making. The proposals consider in this RIA have been subject to public consultation with some changes being made to the final proposals as a result of that consultation. These proposals are dependent on the more timely information reporting of payroll and investment income that is included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017- 18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill as this provides the platform to enable Inland Revenue to more proactively ensure that taxpayers have the correct rate and tax code 6 START - Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology – the new information technology platform being introduced by Inland Revenue as part of its business transformation programme. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 4 during the year to minimise the amount of any end of year square up. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 5 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The overarching objective is to minimise the interaction required by individual taxpayers. This has been assessed against the following criteria: • Compliance costs – Compliance costs are minimised as far as possible • Administration costs – Administration costs are minimised as far as possible • Sustainability – The options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes and enable the efficient administration of the social policies administered by Inland Revenue Year End Process Three options were considered: • Option 1: The status quo • Option 2: An improved status quo • Option 3: An automatic square-up process Option 1: status quo Taxpayers who derive only source deducted income (reportable income 7 ) are not required to file a tax return. At the end of the year those taxpayers who have only reportable income and have a refund owing because of over taxation of under $600 have that refund automatically issued along with a personal tax summary. Those taxpayers who have over $200 of non-reportable income must file either a personal tax summary or a tax return to claim any refund, or square up any liability. Option 2: an improved status quo Under an improved status quo Inland Revenue would use the information provided by the more timely reporting of payroll and investment income to issue more personal tax summaries to taxpayers where under or over payments were identified. This would require taxpayers to confirm or otherwise complete the personal tax summary (unless any refund arising was less than $600 in which case it would continue to be automatically released along with a personal tax summary). Once that had been done a resulting refund would be issued, alternatively a debt would be issued. This option has the benefit of a taxpayer turning their mind to their tax position and confirming that position before a refund is issued which can increase the integrity of the system where a taxpayer earns other non-source deducted income. The downside of this is the increased interaction for the majority of taxpayers who only have reportable income. It also has the disadvantage where a taxpayer does not automatically receive a personal tax 7 Reportable income is income that has tax deducted at source. This includes income from employment, interest, dividends, Mãori Authority distributions and employee share scheme benefits. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 6 summary they have to assess whether they need to request one. Option 3: automatic square-up process (preferred option) This option is based on the premise that for the majority of taxpayers Inland Revenue will hold all the information required to enable it to calculate an end of year tax position for a taxpayer and the step of having a person confirm through the compilation of a personal tax summary is unnecessary. The advantage of this proposal is that it is much easier for taxpayers to understand, offers a better balance between compliance costs and accuracy than option 2, better utilises the increased information available to Inland Revenue from third parties and reduces the number of taxpayers who will have to provide information to Inland Revenue. The disadvantage to this option is that some taxpayers who do not currently interact with the tax system (on the assumption that their reported income has been accurately withheld from) may now have to interact. In the majority this will be receiving a refund where previously they may not have claimed one but the interaction may cause taxpayers some concern. Flow-on effects In addition to these overriding options, a number of other flow-on effects of the year-end process were considered under two headings: • Who has to “square-up” at year end ?; and • How should donation tax credits be dealt with in the future? Who has to square-up at year end? Three options were canvassed in respect of who should have to square up at year end: • Option 1: The status quo – taxpayers are required to obtain a personal tax summary where they have more than $200 of reportable income taxed at the incorrect rate and have to square up any tax shortfall. Those who have a refund of greater than $600 are required to confirm a personal tax summary and automatic refunds for those less than $600; • Option 2: A monetary threshold – taxpayers who have tax to pay or a refund under a certain level would not receive notification for payment or a refund; or • Option 3: The notification model – taxpayers who have advised the payers of their reportable income their correct tax code or rate and the payers are correctly using that code but have still ended up with a shortfall should not have to square up any shortfall as they have met their obligations in respect of their tax affairs. Any refunds ari sing would be automatically refunded. How should donation tax credits be dealt with under the new proposal? Donation tax credits are currently claimed annually using a specific form issued by Inland Revenue. There were a number of options considered to improve this process given the proposed changes to the way the end of year square up was undertaken. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 7 Three options were considered: • Option 1: The status quo with taxpayers either supplying receipts during the year or saving their receipts until the end of the year and then filing a rebate claim form at the end of the tax year to claim the credit; • Option 2: Remove the need for a separate rebate claim form and have taxpayers complete the claim as part of an end of year square up process either through filing a tax return or a personal tax summary; and • Option 3: Allow taxpayers to submit their donation receipts to Inland Revenue during the year which could then form part of their year-end square-up process through either an automatic square-up or tax return process. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Year End Process Officials consider that option 3, an automatic square-up process for taxpayers who only derive reportable income, is the preferred option. Essentially these proposals will result in only those taxpayers who derive more than $200 of non-reportable income 8 , are a non- resident, have tax losses, are subject to the financial arrangement regime or pay provisional tax will need to file a tax return or personal tax summary. It provides taxpayers with a large reduction in compliance costs while not adversely affecting those taxpayers who are using the correct tax codes and rates and who do not currently interact with Inland Revenue (as option 2 might have, depending on the level of the tax to pay threshold). Option 3 also better utilises the more timely information provided to Inland Revenue by third parties in respect of reportable income than the other options. Although all options would allow Inland Revenue to closely monitor and correct any tax code or rate issues which should result in a more accurate tax position for taxpayers, option 3 uses those pro-active actions more fully for taxpayers. In the majority of cases option 3 will ensure that taxpayers receive a refund automatically and not receive a bill where they have ensured that their rate and tax code are correct. This has the benefit of no interaction with Inland Revenue for those taxpayers where option 1 required an interaction prior to the issue of a refund (except for those less than $600). It also provides taxpayers with the certainty that unless they earn non-reportable income they don’t need to consider if they need to file a return or personal tax summary as it will all be completed for them automatically. Who has to square-up any underpayments? 8 Non-reportable income will include amounts not subject to tax at source this would include contracting income or other income not subject to withholding taxes. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 8 The status quo did not ultimately fit with the objective of attempting to minimise the interaction required by taxpayers and, in fact, may have had the opposite effect and was discarded. After consultation it was decided that a combination of the latter two options provided the best outcome for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Two monetary thresholds will apply, one for refunds paid by cheque where only refunds above $5 will be issued by cheque (there is no threshold for electronic payments) and the other for debts less than $20 which will not be assessed/collected from taxpayers. The $5 limit recognises the cost of processing a manual payment. The $20 limit reflects the approximate cost of collection of the small balance. Any credits not refunded under that threshold may be carried forward to future periods any debits under the threshold will be extinguished, rather than being carried forward. In addition, there is an overriding assumption the correct tax code/rate has been used on reportable income. In that case no square-up will be required no matter what the level of the liability. Further, even where an incorrect rate has been used, a square-up will only be required if the incorrect rate was applied to more than $200 of income. Officials consider this combination of the two options provides the best outcome for taxpayers who only derive reportable income, in that, as long as they have ensured that the correct rate or code has been supplied to the payer they have discharged their obligation to ensure their tax position is correct. How should donation tax credits be dealt with under the new proposal? Because donation tax credits could be claimed by a taxpayers who follow differing year-end square up processes it is necessary to have multiple options for taxpayers to use. In addition, there may be a number of options that taxpayers want to enable them to claim their tax rebates. Some maybe comfortable with saving their receipts and claiming these at the end of the year as they already do, others may want to supply receipts when they get them and those who are still required to file a tax return because they have other non-reportable income may want the convenience of claiming their rebate as part of that tax return process. Ultimately officials’ preference is to proceed with all these options as each option has merits for taxpayers dependent on their year-end square up process but also allowing flexibility for taxpayers as to the best way for them to claim their donation tax credits. The proposal is that taxpayers have three ways to claim their donation rebate: 1. They can continue with the current process of filing a separate rebate claim form and either save the receipts until the end of the year or provide these during the year. They could do this whether or not they are required to file a tax return or are part of the automatic square-up process; or 2. For those who are required to file a tax return because of non-reportable income they can choose to include the donation tax credit claim on their tax return for the year supplying the receipts at that time; or 3. A taxpayer could upload their donation receipts to Inland Revenue during the year and these could be automatically refunded at the end of the year (or potentially prepopulated on their tax return should they be required to file one). Officials consider this reduces taxpayer compliance costs and also provides taxpayers with flexibility for the particular system that they are comfortable with to make their donation tax Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 9 credit claim. The preferred options are not incompatible with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 10 Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 9 Business transformation has committed to deliver additional Crown revenue of $2,880m - $6,175 million (including inflation) by 2023/24 as a result of improved voluntary compliance and better use of information and analytics to identify and address non-compliance. The Government has already accounted for the lower end of this range in its fiscal forecasts. These numbers took into account the broad direction of policy intent, as signalled through the Government’s discussion document, Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (including early thinking on individuals’ income tax returns), in addition to the further changes that will be delivered as part of Business Transformation. 10 The data is based on a sample of taxpayers and has been scaled up to population estimates. This data only looks at non-filing individuals earning employment income which is reported on Employee Monthly Schedules, and calculates their likely refund or tax to pay by comparing the actual tax withheld on this income with the amount of tax that should have been withheld. 11 Inland Revenue will be taking proactive action during the year to reduce the number and size of end-of-year discrepancies by moving people to better tax rates and codes so that they only pay what they need to during the year. Accordingly, total year-end refunds issued and total year-end tax to pay will not reflect this static analysis of the quantum of unclaimed refunds or amounts of tax to pay, as year end refunds/amounts to pay will reduce over tim e. Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action 9 Regulated parties Monetary costs for non-filing taxpayers who will be required to pay tax Up to $50m 10 in tax to pay. This is not a forecast, but rather a static analysis of unpaid sums larger than $20 in the 2016 tax year. The $50m does not take account of the amounts that would not have to be paid (because they were withheld in accordance with the rules) suggesting that the total will be lower than $50m. Inland Revenue is not able to quantify what proportion of the $50 million would not be payable. Regulators Administrative costs for Inland Revenue of dealing with customer enquiries or contacts, these are likely to be transitional as people get used to the new rules. These will be accommodated within the Business Transformation programme funding allocated to Inland Revenue. Wider government Reduction in Government revenue through issuing refunds which are not currently issued. $150m 11 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 11 Other parties Total Monetised Cost $200m Non-monetised costs Negative impact on business models of agents or intermediaries who currently file personal tax summaries for customers Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Monetary benefits for current non-filing taxpayers who will automatically receive refunds Cost saving for taxpayers who currently prepare and file personal tax summaries $150m Regulators Reduced administrative costs for Inland Revenue over time These will be accommodated within the Business Transformation programme funding allocated to Inland Revenue. Wider government Increase in Government revenue through collecting amounts of tax which are not currently collected Up to $50m Other parties Total Monetised Benefit $200m Non-monetised benefits The macroeconomic impacts of the flow-on effects from private individuals consuming, investing and/or saving their refunds and, conversely, the private economic activity forgone by individuals who have more tax to pay have not been quantified. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 12 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The associated simplification of the year-end system and perceived fairness to those who are over taxed during the year should have a positive benefit on the way taxpayers view Inland Revenue and the tax system as whole. It also provides a clear tangible benefit to taxpayers from the business transformation programme. The automatic year-end square-up of most taxpayer tax affairs may mean a significant number of clients will no longer need to use an intermediary to file a tax return or personal tax summary on their behalf. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The proposals and preferred options outlined in this RIA were subject to public consultation in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better Administration of Individuals’ Income Tax released by the Minister of Revenue in June 2017. There was also an online forum for the public to make comment on the proposals and a survey was undertaken to gain insights to the final proposals. The submissions on the options were evenly split between supporting the preferred option and proposing a variation on the preferred option which would require individuals to confirm their tax position before an assessment was finalised and a refund issued. This latter approach had been previously ruled out by the Government. A further approach was proposed by two submitters and this was incorporated into the final proposals. This approach was to eliminate a year-end square up for underpayments where the taxpayer had met all their obligations to advise payers of reported income their correct tax code or rate. The other proposals were supported by submitters, including those relating to small balance square-up amounts and claims for donation tax credits. None of the proposals specifically affect iwi and although they had an opportunity to submit on the proposals through the public consultation process it was not considered necessary to separately consult on the proposals with them. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 13 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposed changes are expected to be included in a tax bill to be introduced in early 2018 with application from 1 April 2019 for the 2018-19 income year as this is when the associated changes to the provision of information by payers of reportable income will become mandatory. This date will allow Inland Revenue to commence its proactive actions to ensure that taxpayers are using the correct tax rates and codes and suggest alternatives when that is not the case. The first returns that will be subject to the new year-end square-up process will be for the tax year ended 31 March 2019. Inland Revenue will have responsibility for the implementation and ongoing operation and enforcement of the proposals and will have a communications programme for educating taxpayers of these changes at the time they are implemented. Inland Revenue has extensive experience in implementing, operating and enforcement of these types of changes. Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary Template | 14 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? As part of the implementation and operation, Inland Revenue will be continuously monitoring the effectiveness of the proposals. This is a normal part of the work Inland Revenue does in respect of the tax system to ensure that the rules and processes are fit for purpose. Monitoring and enforcement can only be effective once Inland Revenue is receiving the additional and more timely information from payers of reportable income as it is only at this time that Inland Revenue can increase its proactive actions to ensure taxpayers are using the correct tax code and rates. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? As part of the ongoing monitoring and evaluation, Inland Revenue will be constantly reviewing the outcomes of the proposals with a view to assessing the effectiveness of the changes. As with all aspects of the tax system Inland Revenue is constantly reviewing the outcomes to identify any issues that may need remediation. Inland Revenue also has a number of channels for taxpayers and the public in general to raise any specific concerns with the tax system and it has appropriate pathways to address those concerns.

Coversheet: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought Update aspects of the legislative frameworks in the Tax Administration Act dealing with collection, use and disclosure of information Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? Information flows are key to Inland Revenue’s ability to carry out its functions and to fulfil its role in wider government. Business Transformation provides both a need and an opportunity to examine the rules regarding information to ensure they are fit for purpose for a modern tax administration. The current rules, particularly in relation to information disclosure, have developed in an ad hoc fashion and are complex, inflexible and lacking transparency. While the information collection rules generally work well, there is an opportunity to improve transparency with two minor enhancements. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposals aim to make the information disclosure and use provisions clearer and more principled and to provide greater flexibility and transparency. A new, more targeted confidentiality rule will better focus the rule on protecting what should be protected, namely taxpayer-specific information, while allowing disclosure of a wider range of non-taxpayer information. A clearer, more principled exceptions framework will provide greater transparency. The proposed enhancements to the information collection rules will also provide greater certainty and transparency regarding Inland Revenue’s regular collection and use of certain third party information. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 1 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? In relation to information sharing the main expected benefits will fall to other agencies who are able to more easily access Inland Revenue’s information for service provision or enforcement. This will also have benefits for customers where it reduces the need to provide the same information to multiple agencies and/or ensures they receive more accurate, up-to-date entitlements. For information collection the main expected benefits will be administrative for Inland Revenue in having regular access to datasets that can be used for compliance, service delivery and education purposes. There may also be compliance cost reductions to taxpayers from improved service, including from increased pre-population of returns. Where do the costs fall? There may be increased administrative costs to Inland Revenue in developing and administering increased numbers of information shares, however Business Transformation provides the opportunity to do this in a more efficient manner. New regulations for repeated collection of datasets may impose costs on the entity from which the information is collected. When considering proposed new collection regulations these potential costs will be taken into account. It is not possible to quantify the costs at this time, as the changes that may result in additional costs will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? With all information sharing there is a risk of privacy breaches. This also raises a concern that increased sharing or any breaches might reduce the willingness of customers to provide their information to Inland Revenue. Consideration of privacy impacts (including consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner) and potential impacts on the integrity of the tax system are built into the proposed information sharing rules. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no significant incompatibility with the Government’s “Expectations for the design of regulatory systems”. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 2 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident that the evidence supports the proposal. Inland Revenue has extensive experience working with the confidentiality rules and the issues that arise with the current framework. While the total costs and benefits cannot be quantified at this time as they primarily arise from regulations that would be made under proposed empowering provisions, past experience with both ad hoc large dataset collection and with information sharing arrangements entered into under current provisions has seen the generation of significant benefits. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – information collection, use and disclosure Regulatory Impact Analysis and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Analysis meets the Quality Assurance criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 3 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Statement, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 4 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The impact analysis is limited because there is some uncertainty about: • The number of new information sharing arrangements that may be sought by other agencies; • The timeframe and resource that might be involved in moving existing sharing arrangements from the current rules into the proposed new framework; and • The scope of datasets to which regular access might be sought under the proposed regulatory framework. Number of information sharing arrangements that may be sought by other agencies At any given time Inland Revenue has several proposals from other agencies for information sharing under consideration or development. These are assessed using a set of internally developed principles and prioritised accordingly. Inland Revenue has a dedicated team and governance structure that monitors and prioritises these requests. The number of requests in train at any one time can vary, as can the complexity of the requests. At the time of this analysis there were nine new information sharing proposals at various stages of being considered or progressed. The current framework means that some of these proposed arrangements can be dealt with by way of regulation; however, others involve statutory amendment. This can be a time consuming process. The proposed new rules will mean arrangements can be more flexible and completed more quickly. However there is some uncertainty about how many new or amended arrangements may be sought and therefore the extent of any administrative impacts. In general this will be able to be managed by the prioritisation process; however, at times agencies or Ministers may not have aligned priorities, placing pressure on resources. Timeframe and resource for moving existing arrangements to the new framework Alongside new requests for sharing, Inland Revenue and partner agencies also review and consider potential changes to existing arrangements. For example, changes have recently been made to information sharing with the Ministry of Social Development, moving the arrangements into the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework rather than the previous information matching rules which required very specific legislative exceptions. It is proposed that existing legislative provisions will be grand-parented into the new rules and then gradually replaced by arrangements under the new framework as and when they are updated. Again, while there is some uncertainty about the timeframe and resource requirements for this work, and when other agencies will look to alter their arrangements, this can generally be prioritised using established procedures. At the time of this analysis, there were nine existing agreements under review, or where alterations have been proposed. Scope of datasets Inland Revenue already has the ability to collect and work with large datasets; however, these datasets are generally obtained on an ad hoc basis. The availability and usefulness of ‘big data’ is an area that is evolving rapidly. Business Transformation will provide Inland Revenue with increased capability to work with such datasets. There is currently scope to obtain and use certain datasets for compliance, educative and pre-population purposes – this is occurring for example in Australia and the United Kingdom. However the benefits of any given dataset will vary and the identification of potentially useful datasets will be an iterative process. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 5 As a general rule, Inland Revenue would have previously trialled the collection of data (or data of a similar type) using its general collection power before seeking a regulation. Previous collection and analysis of the dataset will assist to demonstrate the benefits of collecting the data regularly. Prior collection will also enable prioritisation of datasets for regular collection. While overseas experience indicates certain areas where repeat dataset collection would be valuable, the number or scope of datasets that might be sought under the proposed new rule is unclear at this time, which constrains the analysis of the benefits. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? For most public sector agencies the primary rules governing collection and disclosure of information are found in the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. For Inland Revenue, however, the primary rules are contained in Part 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The efficient and effective administration of the tax system depends on taxpayers disclosing often significant amounts of information to Inland Revenue. Information is provided by both individuals and corporates and may be about themselves or about others, for example, employers provide information both about their own affairs and abut their employees. The types of information collected covers a considerable range, including identity and contact information, income details, for social policy customers information about relationships and household income, for businesses detailed commercial information. This need for information and the broad powers Inland Revenue is granted to obtain it are seen as balanced by a strict rule of confidentiality, often referred to as the “tax secrecy” rule. The right of taxpayers to have their information kept confidential is also specifically recognised in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act in defining the integrity of the tax system. Over time, increasing numbers of ad hoc exceptions have been added to the tax secrecy rule. The primary exception, in place since the inception of the rule, permits Inland Revenue to disclose information in order to carry out its functions. Many other exceptions, however, relate to disclosure to other agencies for purposes not related, or not directly related, to Inland Revenue’s functions (for example to administer the accident compensation scheme, or the benefits system). Inland Revenue already shares a significant amount of information, primarily with other government agencies; therefore the proposed changes are not a new concept. The proposals are intended to clarify and update the confidentiality and sharing rules. A key aim is to more clearly balance the trade-offs inherent in decisions about whether to share. The current rules, due to the ad hoc nature of amendments over time, could be seen to lack cohesion, transparency and clear unifying principles. In addition, the breadth of the core rule itself (protecting all matters relating to the legislation administered by Inland Revenue) appears much wider than the rationale for the rule would suggest is necessary. The previous Government, through initiatives such as Better Public Services, has been focused on improving the use of information within and across agencies. Achieving better outcomes for New Zealanders through wider and smarter use of data is a key focus. The Data Futures Forum, and subsequent Data Futures Partnership have been considering how to get the best value from data in a rapidly changing environment. Rather than taking a siloed approach, agencies are encouraged to work together to provide services. Other related work includes reviewing the settings in the Privacy Act and the Statistics Act, and a focus on the social investment approach which is strongly data-driven. Draft Customs and Excise legislation before Parliament also contains modernised information sharing rules. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 7 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The information and confidentiality (“tax secrecy”) rules form a key aspect of the Tax Administration Act framework, with confidentiality of taxpayer information specified as an important aspect of the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue has broad powers to obtain the information it needs to fulfil its function of managing the tax system. These powers are balanced with a requirement to keep information confidential. Inland Revenue has a Regulatory Stewardship Strategy published in August 2017 (EGI-17- MIN-0210) that has assessed the fitness for purpose of Inland Revenue’s regulatory systems. The Tax Administration Act generally falls within the revenue raising and collection regulatory system and the strategy also includes a specific information sharing regulatory system. As noted in the Regulatory Stewardship Strategy, information sharing arrangements aim at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government and to provide better services and outcomes to customers. This is balanced against the need to maintain taxpayer trust that their information is not disclosed inappropriately. The strategy notes that the rules are constantly being looked at and that this review has been carried out to modernise and clarify the rules to better balance the inherent trade-offs and provide for confidentiality and sharing in a customer centric and intelligence led environment. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The Business Transformation programme provides both a need and an opportunity to consider the regulatory settings relating to Inland Revenue’s information. Increasing digitisation of information and processes provides opportunities to better utilise data, both within Inland Revenue to assist taxpayers, and, where appropriate, across government to improve the provision of public services. The current rules regarding information collection, use and disclosure were developed in a paper-based environment, and while many of the underlying principles remain applicable, Business Transformation provides the opportunity to ensure the rules continue to be fit for purpose and make the most of the improved technology. The confidentiality of taxpayer information is a key component of the integrity of the tax system and remains the norm among international revenue agencies. Information flows are crucial to the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. Confidentiality rules are seen as facilitating this in three ways: • encouraging people to provide information with the confidence it will be used and protected appropriately; • acting as a balance for the broad information collection powers of Inland Revenue; and • acting to protect taxpayer privacy. The current confidentiality or “tax secrecy” rule is extremely broad and covers all matters relating to the legislation administered by Inland Revenue. However, the reasons for the rule indicate the primary concern is information about taxpayers. The existing rule can lead to tensions between confidentiality and the Official Information Act’s principle of open access to government information. The current rule can also give rise to tensions between confidentiality and wider government objectives that can be achieved through increased Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 8 information sharing. Inland Revenue deals with large numbers of documents, forms, letters and tax returns that contain information about matters such as taxpayers’ circumstances, income or assets. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. The information collection powers work well and no significant change is recommended. However, two areas have been identified where change is considered of benefit - the regular collection of large datasets and the re-use of information within Inland Revenue. In both cases a key benefit is increased transparency for taxpayers regarding the collection of information about them and the possible uses of this information. The proposed empowering provision for regulations governing repeat collection of large datasets would provide a more efficient mechanism for Inland Revenue to regularly obtain necessary or relevant information for compliance, analytical and educative purposes. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There were no particular constraints on the options considered. In considering the wide spectrum of options the importance of confidentiality rules to robust international tax information exchange (countries can choose not to exchange information with jurisdictions if they are not satisfied with their confidentiality laws) and to the concept of tax system integrity, narrowed the analysis to looking at options which maintained some form of confidentiality rules. The analysis then focused on the degree to which the confidentiality rules might be updated. Another relevant consideration was ensuring, insofar as appropriate, that the rules are aligned with other government frameworks for information – in particular, the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework in the Privacy Act, the Official Information Act, and reviews being carried out in relation to bespoke legislation such as the Statistics Act and the Customs and Excise Act. Work relating to the social investment approach, in particular data frameworks to support this approach, and the Data Futures programme were also relevant considerations. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The treatment of taxpayer information affects all taxpayers and there are various stakeholders that have an interest. The issue will not affect Māori in particular. Formal public consultation has been undertaken via two Government discussion documents: Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act released in November 2015 and Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act released in December 2016. Both discussion documents had an accompanying online forum. Towards a new Tax Administration Act generated 18 written submissions and 34 comments on the online forum. In relation to information the key themes were: • Mixed reactions to the proposal to narrow tax secrecy, coupled with particular Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 9 concern about the need to protect commercial information and the need for adequate confidentiality protections. • A mixed response to greater information sharing within government – some submitters were supportive but others felt information sharing should be confined to tax-related purposes only. Concern was expressed about agencies being able to obtain information they would not be entitled to collect in their own right. The importance of transparency around sharing was emphasised. • Consent-based disclosure of information was favoured by a narrow majority, so long as it was confined to within government. Some submitters considered that a taxpayer’s ability to access their information themselves (or have an agent access it) was sufficient. • There was general support for clarification regarding collection of large datasets and remote access searching. Some submitters were in support of new rules that would provide more transparency but not of expanding the search powers. Towards a new Tax Administration Act provided a high-level framework for key areas of tax administration. The consultation process indicated that the issues were wide-ranging and complex and would benefit from further, more detailed consultation. Therefore a second discussion document Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act was released in December 2016. The more detailed proposals in this document took into account the feedback received on Towards a new Tax Administration Act. There were 15 written submissions and 19 online comments of Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. Submissions were generally supportive of the proposals relating to information, provided appropriate safeguards were in place. Key themes were: • General support for limiting the coverage of the secrecy rule so long as commercial information was protected. • Support for clarifying the framework of exceptions and for the proposed cross- government information-sharing framework, so long as other agencies cannot obtain information they are otherwise not entitled to. Consultation was seen as an important component of the framework. • Support for maintaining and clarifying the rules regarding improper disclosure. • Submitters generally favoured the proposed regulation-making power for repeat dataset collection and the additional transparency this would provide. Submitters on both discussion documents comprised a mixture of professional services firms, business, citizen and professional representative bodies, accounting and digital technology businesses, and some private individuals. Inland Revenue has also recently carried out a statutory review of section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act. This provision enables regulations to be made to authorise sharing with other government agencies and is the basis for the proposals regarding enhanced cross- government sharing. The review 1 included consultation with the two departments with whom agreements have been entered into (ACC and the Ministry of Social Development) and with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, The Treasury, and the Ministry of Justice. In general there was support for retaining the provision, preferably with some guidance regarding when it would be more appropriate to use section 81BA than the Approved Information Sharing 1 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-other-report-review-s81b-taa.pdf Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 10 Agreement framework in the Privacy Act. The review concluded that section 81BA should be retained pending the outcome of the wider consultation regarding the confidentiality and information sharing rules addressed in this regulatory impact analysis. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options for analysis fall into three broad categories – collection, use and disclosure of information and have been analysed within these categories. The three categories can be viewed as stand-alone, and are not interdependent. The recommended package of options (summarised at 5.1) contains options from all three categories. The most significant parts of the package are the proposals that will make it easier for Inland Revenue to undertake repeat collection of large datasets from external sources and for Inland Revenue to share its information with other agencies. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION The status quo information collection rules broadly work well. One aspect has been identified where there is an opportunity to make the rules more efficient and to improve transparency. This relates to the repeat collection of large datasets – under the status quo this can be done on an ad hoc basis by issuing a section 17 request, but this process is not well suited to situations where the information is sought on a repeating, regular basis. There are two alternative options: Collection option 1: Amend the information collection power to provide specifically for repeat collection of large datasets This option would see an amendment to the existing information collection power to specifically cover repeated collection of large external datasets. Such collection can already be carried out on an ad hoc basis, however for regular collection of the same datasets it is considered that more specific rules are required. Such collection would continue to be based on the existing “necessary or relevant” standard. Submitters on Towards a new Tax Administration Act generally agreed that a more explicit collection power was appropriate, but did not consider there should be expanded powers as Inland Revenue already has broad collection powers. There was unanimous support for retaining the “necessary or relevant” standard. Several submitters considered that if there were to be more explicit powers in relation to bulk data (external datasets) there should be greater transparency about this collection. Some suggested a process similar to the Australian Tax Office publication of data matching protocols should be followed. These protocols set out the bulk datasets collected and broadly the uses to which this information is put. Collection option 2: Introduce a regulation-making power governing repeat collection of large datasets (part of recommended package) Under this option, a specific regulation-making power would be introduced, allowing regulations to be made governing repeat collection of large external datasets. This option responds to submissions seeking greater transparency about this form of collection and was Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 11 detailed in the second consultation document Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act. Submitters generally favoured this option, with the attendant increased transparency, provided there was consultation on the development of regulations and consideration of compliance costs. USE OF INFORMATION In many cases interactions with a customer are related to a particular purpose, or relate to a particular product type – for example personal income tax or Working for Families tax credits. However the information obtained may also be relevant for other purposes, for example the customer’s student loan or child support accounts. In many cases customers, both business and individual have a range of different interaction needs with Inland Revenue and therefore information can be relevant for a range of purposes related to Inland Revenue’s various functions. Under the status quo there is no express statement about the use of information in the Tax Administration Act. However, the Kiwisaver Act 2006 does contain a rule that information collected under that Act can be used for the purposes of any other Inland Revenue Act (and vice versa) 2 . Information use option 1: Express clarification that information gathered for one purpose can be used for other purposes within Inland Revenue (part of recommended package) Under this option, the legislation would expressly state the principle that information collection for the purpose of one of Inland Revenue’s functions can be used for any of its other functions. This is consistent with the approach in the equivalent UK legislation which states “information acquired by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function may be used by them in connection with any other function.” Submitters were supportive of this option and emphasised the importance of clarity for taxpayers regarding the circumstances in which their information could be used. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION There are two key areas regarding disclosure for which options have been considered – the scope of the confidentiality rule (that is, what should be the starting point for what can and cannot be disclosed) and the rules regarding sharing information across government. Two additional options for improvements to the rules are also considered. A: Scope of confidentiality rule We have identified a single alternative to the status quo for the scope of the confidentiality rule. This option has been broadened in scope from the original proposal as a result of consultation. Disclosure option 1: Better target the confidentiality rule (part of recommended package) The initial proposal set out in Towards a new Tax Administration Act was to narrow the “tax secrecy” rule to a “taxpayer confidentiality” rule, namely one that was limited to information 2 Kiwisaver Act 2006, section 223. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 12 that would identify (directly or indirectly) a taxpayer. Narrowing the rule in this way would continue to protect taxpayer information, the core reason for the confidentiality rules, but more easily allow the release of anonymised, aggregated information, together with information that did not identify taxpayers – for example, policy information, procurement information, training information and finance and planning information. A more targeted rule is consistent with the confidentiality rules in jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United States. In the United Kingdom the rule extends to information held in connection with the functions of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, however only information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer is exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information laws. Submitters expressed concerns about information that, while it might not identify a taxpayer, could still be very sensitive, in particular commercially sensitive information. Several submissions also highlighted the need for safeguards, and for protections to remain in place for commercially sensitive information. A narrowly drafted rule focused on information that identifies a taxpayer would provide a clear boundary but would risk narrowing the protection too far. In order to adequately protect sensitive taxpayer information, the rule should extend past information that is identifying to a rule such as that in Australia, where the protection protects information “that relates to the affairs of, or identifies an entity”. 3 This means that information that does not directly identify a taxpayer will also be protected, as will information that may not even indirectly identify the taxpayer but relates to their affairs – for example, information about a commercially sensitive process that would not identify the taxpayer but is intellectual property that relates to that taxpayer. The new targeted confidentiality rule should also retain protection for certain sensitive non- taxpayer information. Inland Revenue holds certain very sensitive information, besides that relating to taxpayers, the release of which could damage the integrity of the tax system. Such information would include audit and investigative techniques or strategies, compliance information, thresholds and analytical approaches. Releasing this information could affect the Crown’s ability to collect revenue, for example by enabling taxpayers to defraud the system. The Official Information Act allows information to be withheld if the release would prejudice the maintenance of the law, but there is no specific protection for public revenue. In contrast, the Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 contains a number of protections that are used as grounds by the Australian Tax Office to withhold sensitive non-taxpayer information. Similarly, the United Kingdom freedom of information legislation also contains broader protection for non-taxpayer, sensitive revenue information. The “maintenance of the law” protection may cover some of the sensitive non-taxpayer information outlined above, but it is not clear this would always be the case. The protection of public revenue is considered of sufficient importance that a residual protection should be retained in the confidentiality rule in the Tax Administration Act. 3 Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Commonwealth) Schedule 1, Chapter 5, Division 355. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 13 B: Information sharing The status quo is a combination of specific legislative provisions for each information sharing arrangement and utilising regulatory frameworks set out in section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act and Part 9A of the Privacy Act 1993. The regulatory frameworks provide greater flexibility than specific legislative provisions, however, there is an opportunity to improve the flexibility and usefulness of these rules. Disclosure option 2: Retain a regulatory sharing model with broader principles and extend to “public service provision” (part of recommended package) Section 81BA was put in place prior to the Approved Information Sharing Agreement rules in the Privacy Act. Sharing under 81BA is limited to government agencies, where that agency is lawfully able to collect the information but the provision, collection and verification by that agency is inefficient. While this is, and has been, a useful provision, the criteria are not as flexible as they could be, in particular as regards the limitation to “government agency” and the requirement that it be inefficient for the requesting agency to carry out the collection itself. Under this option, the basic model of section 81BA (information-sharing authorised by regulation) is retained but some greater flexibility would be introduced to allow sharing for “public service provision” rather than only with government agencies. Under this option the criteria would be modernised to permit sharing where: • providing the information will improve the ability of the government to efficiently and effectively deliver services or enforce laws; and • the information is more easily or more efficiently obtained from or verified by Inland Revenue than from other sources; and • the amount and type of information provided is proportionate given the purpose for which it is being shared; and • the information will be adequately protected by the receiving agency; and • sharing the information will not unduly inhibit the provision of information to the Inland Revenue Department in the future. These criteria are similar to those in 81BA, the key differences being a relaxation in the requirement that information sharing occur only when direct collection/verification is inefficient, to permitting sharing where it is more easily or efficiently obtained from, or verified by, Inland Revenue, and the introduction of an express proportionality consideration. Consideration of any impacts on future information provision to Inland Revenue, and requirements for adequate protection by the receiving agency are similar to those in section 81BA. Extending the provision to sharing for “provision of public services” rather than limiting to government agencies makes this option more consistent with the Privacy Act Approved Information Sharing Agreement rules. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has expressed concern about the proliferation of information sharing frameworks, and expressed a preference for agencies to use the rules in the Privacy Act. Inland Revenue does utilise these rules where appropriate, however they primarily focus on sharing personal information, and are therefore not appropriate for information shares that primarily concern non-personal (business) information. This option provides rules, similar to those in the Privacy Act, to deal with situations where the information to be shared is mainly of a non-personal nature. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 14 Disclosure option 3: Authorise all sharing by agreement between Chief Executives Under this option, a legislative provision would authorise the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into agreements with other Chief Executives regarding the sharing of Inland Revenue’s information, without any requirement for regulations. A similar model was proposed by the New Zealand Customs Service, however has been modified during the legislative process to now propose requiring Ministerial authorisation. While this would provide a highly flexible model, the importance of taxpayer confidentiality is considered to be such that a regulatory model, with Cabinet and Regulations Review Committee oversight was more appropriate. A regulatory model is also more consistent with the Approved Information Sharing Agreement model in the Privacy Act, which Inland Revenue will continue to utilise where appropriate, namely where the agreement primarily involves sharing personal information. Disclosure option 4: Authorise consent-based sharing for public service provision by agreement between Chief Executives (part of recommended package) While an agreement-based model was not considered appropriate for all information sharing (in particular sharing that is done without need to seek consent or advise those whose information is shared), under this option information sharing done with the consent of the taxpayer concerned could be governed by agreement, without need to seek a regulation. This option is intended to facilitate more flexible information sharing for public service provision, carried out with the informed consent of the taxpayer concerned. This option would cover situations such as, for example, where a regional non-governmental agency (NGO) has a service agreement with the Ministry of Social Development to assist people to find affordable housing and access their housing-related (or other) government entitlements. To provide the best service, the NGO needs access to up-to-date information about the customer, including their income and other social policy entitlements and obligations. The NGO obtains the informed consent of the customer to access this information. Under this option Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development and the NGO (and potentially other NGOs offering the same service) would sign an agreement. Inland Revenue could then provide the information to the Ministry and/or the NGO in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Consent-based sharing was raised in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, noting the risk of coerced consent. It was therefore suggested that limiting consent-based sharing government agencies might be appropriate in the first instance. This was a position supported by submitters, and reiterated in Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act, with the modification of permitting this form of sharing for the provision of public services (consistent with the regulatory government information sharing proposal and the Approved Information Sharing Agreement framework). Also noted in Towards a new Tax Administration Act was the possibility that the eventual development of integrated online services might largely remove the need for this form of consented sharing as the customer would be to access the information themselves and forward it in a digital format to the agency or agencies with whom they wished to share it. However, this option is not yet available, and while some submitters considered that the existing ability to access one’s own information and pass it on (in a non-digital format) sufficient, enabling a consent-based system for sharing information for public service Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 15 provision will provide for a more flexible and responsive approach to be taken to improving services for customers seeking optional cross-government services. C: Other options for improvements We have identified two additional options to improve the rules relating to information disclosure, primarily focused on providing additional clarity. Additional option 1: Provide a more cohesive and transparent framework of exceptions to the confidentiality rule (part of recommended package) The current legislative set of exceptions has developed in an ad hoc matter over a long period of time. This has led to a framework that could be seen as lacking in transparency and clear unifying principles. Under this option the legislation would set out four clear categories of exceptions: disclosures for purposes related to the tax system; disclosures to taxpayers and their agents; international disclosures; and disclosures to other government agencies for non-tax-related purposes. Setting out clear categories of exceptions would provide greater transparency and clarity to the legislation. Additional option 2: Retain the existing penalties for knowing breach of confidentiality and clarify their application to third parties with access to Inland Revenue’s information (part of recommended package) This option is largely a reflection of the status quo, updated to take account of changes proposed by disclosure option 1. There are existing penalties for Inland Revenue officers and certain other persons who knowingly fail to maintain secrecy. This option proposes to carry over those penalties to the new confidentiality rules proposed in option 1. This option also proposes clarification/modernisation to the penalty as it applies to persons other than Inland Revenue officers. As the exceptions to the confidentiality rule have been updated in an ad hoc manner over time, the attendant penalty rules have not always received the corresponding updates. Under this option the penalty rule will be updated to clearly apply to all situations where someone with access to confidential Inland Revenue information knowingly improperly discloses that information. The penalty – imprisonment for a maximum of 6 months, or maximum fine of $15,000, or both – would remain the same as currently. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria used to assess the likely impacts are: • Transparency; • Efficiency – of both administration and compliance, so options should both reduce compliance costs and administrative effort; • Flexibility – options should provide a level of flexibility or future-proofing for ongoing changes in information collection and sharing; • Integrity of the tax system – information is critical to the functioning of Inland Revenue and therefore any impacts on integrity, or perceptions of integrity, that might in some way affect the quality of information Inland Revenue is able to obtain are key considerations. In general these criteria work together and do not require significant trade-offs. However the Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 16 criterion of integrity, as defined in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act, includes the “rights of taxpayers to have their affairs kept confidential”. When it comes to exceptions to confidentiality, including information sharing, there is an inherent trade-off between confidentiality and efficiency or, in some cases, transparency. It should be noted however, particularly in relation to disclosures for tax-related purposes, that the statutory concept of integrity also includes the responsibility of taxpayers to comply with the law. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? An option that was ruled out of scope early in the analysis was removing the specific tax secrecy rules and instead relying on the Privacy Act. The key issue with this approach is that a considerable amount of taxpayer information held by Inland Revenue relates to companies, trusts and other entities, and would therefore not be covered by the Privacy Act. Therefore, rules for the non-personal information would still be required. There are also potentially issues with the boundary between personal and non-personal information – for example, when considering company information that includes information about the directors. Other factors that saw this option ruled out of scope early were the importance of confidentiality rules to robust international tax information exchange (noting that countries can choose not to exchange information with jurisdictions if they are not satisfied with their confidentiality laws) and to tax system integrity more broadly. As a result, the analysis was confined to looking at options which maintained some form of confidentiality rules. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 17 Section 4: Impact Analysis Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Collection and use of information options No action Amend collection power to authorise repeat external dataset collection Regulation-making power for repeat external dataset collection Clarify use of information for multiple revenue purposes Transparency 0 0 This option would not see any greater transparency of collection than the current ad hoc approach. ++ Regulations and associated material are published meaning there is a public record o f this type of collection along with information about what the data will be used for. ++ While this is largely viewed as the current position by Inland Revenue, it may not be clear to taxpayers. A clear statement in the legislation will assist transparency. Efficiency 0 + Providing specifically for repeat collection would improve administrative efficiency. ++ Where a case for repeat collection is made, this process provides greater administrative efficiency than ongoing ad hoc requests. While provision may impose costs, there may be greater efficiency in a standard process for data holders. + Appropriate reuse of data is more administratively efficient than repeat requests for the same information from the customer. This is also more efficient for the customer. Care must be taken, consistent with the privacy principles, to ensure information remains accurate and up-to-date. Flexibility 0 ++ A legislative power would provide some flexibility but may require a greater degree of specificity in the primary legislation than a regulation- making approach. ++ A regulation-based approach provides for greater flexibility in relation to each individual regulatory instrument, as broader principles can be specified in the legislation. + This approach gives Inland Revenue clearer administrative flexibility with information.

Submitters support this option provided commercially sensitive information is protected. ++ This option will see, over time, many of the existing legislative sharing arrangements moved into the regulatory framework which will provide greater transparency because the regulations and agreements are published. - Agreements could be required to be published which would enhance transparency, however, this model has no Ministerial or Parliamentary oversight which could be seen to reduce transparency. ++ Customers will be aware of the information sharing as informed consent is required. Efficiency ++ The current rule is inefficient as it protects information it does not need to protect. The narrower rule would allow non-taxpayer information to be released or shared more efficiently. + Improved information sharing improves efficiency for both customers who do not have to provide information multiple times, and for government as it can be reused rathe r than collected multiple times. ++ Improved information sharing improves efficiency both for customers who do not have to provide information multiple times, and for government as it can be reused rather than collected multiple times. ++ Improves efficiency both for customers, who do not have to provide their information multiple times and for wider government as, rather than needing to seek information from customers, it can directly verify from Inland Revenue. Flexibility ++ The proposal provides greater flexibility to release information while protecting a broad range of information about taxpayers and sensitive non-taxpayer information. + A regulatory model is more flexible than legislative exceptions – broadening the application of the regulatory model will enhance flexibility. ++ An agreement based model is more flexible and allows agreements to be updated more quickly. ++ An agreement based model is more flexible than legislative or regulatory options, allowing for faster deployment of new services and changes to agreements. Integrity ++ The rule remains protective of taxpayer information rather than a wider set of information.

The proposed package of options considered to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits is: • Collection – collection option two: regulation-making power for repeat collection of external datasets. • Use – use option one: express clarification that information gathered for one purpose can be used for other purposes within Inland Revenue. • Disclosure: o Scope – disclosure option one: a better targeted confidentiality rule focused on protecting information about taxpayers and sensitive non-taxpayer information. o Information sharing – disclosure options two and four: an enhanced regulatory sharing model together with consent based sharing governed by agreements. Both options are limited to information sharing for public service provision. o Other enhancements – additional options one and two: a more cohesive and transparent framework of exceptions and clarification of the penalty rules, namely retaining the existing penalties for knowing breach of confidentiality and clarifying their application to third parties with access to Inland Revenue’s information. This package of options has been assessed as providing improved transparency, efficiency and flexibility, while maintaining or improving the integrity of the tax system. In general, stakeholders expressed support for the proposed package, provided sufficient safeguards were in place for commercial information and to ensure that information sharing did not allow other agencies to access information they were not entitled to. The proposals have been designed to ensure these concerns are addressed. Stakeholders were keen to see enhanced transparency around Inland Revenue’s collection, use and disclosure of information and this package of proposals will ensure improvements in this respect. Inland Revenue has extensive experience with the application of its information collection, use and disclosure rules and therefore has a good understanding of the areas that work well and not so well. This package of reforms has been designed to improve the rules without undermining the fundamental areas that continue to work well, primarily confidentiality of taxpayer information and collection rules based on a ‘necessary or relevant’ standard. As shown in 5.2 below, the main impacts of the package relate to the proposals that will make it easier for Inland Revenue to undertake repeat collection of large datasets from external parties and for Inland Revenue to share its information with other agencies. The other proposals have limited impacts.

These costs will vary depending on the information sought and the systems of the information holder. In cases where information is currently sought on an ad hoc basis, making provision regular may have minimal additional impact. Low Medium Regulators – Inland Revenue There may be increased costs for Inland Revenue associated with increased information sharing. Low High Wider government Other parties Total Monetised Cost It is not possible to quantify the costs at this time, as the changes that may result in additional costs will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions. Non-monetised costs Low Medium Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties - customers Information sharing can provide compliance cost savings to customers where it reduces the need for them to provide their information to multiple agencies. High High Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 22 Regulators – Inland Revenue Improved information holdings for compliance, educative and pre- population work from repeat dataset collection. High High Wider government – departments and NGO service providers Improved ability to share information and more flexibility to make changes to existing arrangements. This should lead to improved efficiency across government. By way of example from some of the existing information sharing arrangements in the year ending 30 June 2017: • The proactive share with MSD to prevent benefit fraud identified an estimated $46.3 million in overpayments; • Information Inland Revenue shared with the Ministry of Justice enabled it to collect more than $11.2 million in overdue fines; • Inland Revenue shared information 39 times in response to 45 valid requests for information from WorkSafe New Zealand and the Labour Inspectorate, which is part of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. This is helping them to investigate breaches in workplace legislation. High High Other parties Total Monetised Benefit It is not possible to quantify the benefits at this time, as the specific changes will occur when regulations are made under the new information sharing and collection empowering provisions.

Nothing not already covered elsewhere in this analysis. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 24 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred options are consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The preferred options should deliver a more appropriately targeted, transparent set of rules for the collection, use and disclosure of information by Inland Revenue. The preferred options aim to minimise cost across the system, better align with related requirements in the Privacy Act and Official Information Act, conform with established legal and constitutional principles and are generally similar in nature to rules in place in the United Kingdom and Australia. The preferred options have the scope to evolve in response to changing circumstances or new information on the regulatory system’s performance. Regulations provide a more flexible and adaptive approach to managing information sharing, and the proposed regulatory approach to repeat dataset collection provides a more transparent and certain process for both data holders, and those whose information is being collected. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 25 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred options will need to be implemented by legislative amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. For the most part the preferred options will require amendment to, and consolidation of, existing provisions. It is intended that Part 4 of the Act will be substantially redrafted to give effect to the preferred options. A new empowering provision will be required to enable the making of regulations governing repeat collection of data. The empowering provision for information sharing regulations will require amendments to an existing provision (section 81BA). Transitional provisions will be required to grandparent existing information sharing arrangements. Over time these can be moved within the new regulatory framework and the provisions removed. The amendments could be included in the first omnibus taxation bill of 2018. The amendments could apply from date of enactment. Explanation of the amendments and their effect would be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin released shortly after the Bill received Royal assent. Inland Revenue’s internal and external guidance will be updated and where necessary, new guidance developed, to assist staff and taxpayers with the application of the new rules. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the rules. Other agencies with an interest, in particular those with whom information is shared, will, as now, be involved in an ongoing relationship with Inland Revenue relating to the operation of that information sharing. Relevant stakeholders will be involved in consultation where any new information sharing or information collection regulations are proposed. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is a risk there could be a large number of agencies that seek new or amended information sharing arrangements following the enactment of the proposed information sharing rules. Inland Revenue has a set of principles that are applied to the prioritisation of information sharing proposals that can be used to help deal with this situation should it arise. As the proposed new rules are an extension of existing rules, rather than a completely new regime, this risk is considered relatively low. With use and disclosure of information, in particular information sharing, there is always a risk of a privacy or information breach. Consideration of these risks and protections that should be put in place will be built into the proposed rules. Information sharing agreements will also deal with agreed uses and disclosure of information provided by Inland Revenue. The preferred options also include proposals to maintain the obligation for staff to keep Inland Revenue information confidential and to clarify the corresponding Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 26 obligation on those in receipt of Inland Revenue information. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – collection, use and disclosure of information | 27 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of regulations made under the proposed information sharing and dataset collection enabling provisions within that period to ensure they were consistent with the intended policy. The empowering provision for dataset collection regulations will contain a requirement that the operation of the provision is reviewed after 5 years. This will include consultation with external parties and reviewing the costs and benefits of regulations made under the empowering provision. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. The Regulations Review Committee would also have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations made. The Committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency and good legislative practice. The Committee reports to the House and other committees on any issue it identifies. The House can “disallow” a regulation, meaning it no longer has force. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The proposals relating to both information sharing and repeat information collection are to be governed by regulations. As part of the regulation making process consultation will be required. This will give stakeholders an opportunity to make comment and raise any concerns about the proposed sharing or collection. The proposals also require regulations and underlying agreements to be published, making available a greater level of information about information shared and collected than is currently the case. Greater awareness of these matters provides greater opportunity for people to raise any concerns they may have, either with Inland Revenue, or with a relevant regulator, such as the Privacy Commissioner. As above, the Regulations Review Committee also has a role in this regard.

Coversheet: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act - flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies Advising agencies Inland Revenue Decision sought How best to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. Proposing Ministers Minister of Revenue Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has limited ability to deal with situations when a provision is not consistent with the intended policy (legislative anomalies). This ties up taxpayer and Commissioner resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The proposed approach would enable regulations or determinations to be made, or administrative action to be taken, to address legislative anomalies. The power would be subject to safeguards including consistency with the existing policy and the principles supporting the integrity of the tax system; the outcomes would be optional for taxpayers to apply and would expire in three years. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 1 Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The proposed approach would have no direct impact because it would only enact an empowering provision. The main expected beneficiaries of any regulations or determinations made under the power would be the full range of taxpayers, including individual taxpayers through to large corporates. The expected benefit would be increased certainty for taxpayers and reduced compliance costs. Where do the costs fall? The main costs of the proposal would fall on Inland Revenue in having to administer the system. Some minor costs would fall on taxpayers in having to maintain awareness of any regulations or determinations made, or administrative action taken. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The introduction of the power could raise risks for the rule of law. However, there are various elements of the proposed approach that would mitigate the risks to the rule of law including the limited scope of the power, the procedural safeguards (including parliamentary oversight), and the temporary nature of any exemptions. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. There is no significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? Inland Revenue is confident that the evidence supports the policy proposal. Analysis has been undertaken to determine the impact of the current problem, including the length of time taken to remedy anomalies under the current system. Analysis has also been undertaken of comparative regimes overseas, including the recently enacted Australian regime.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 4 Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There are two limitations on the analysis because there is some uncertainty about: • the number of suggested applications of the exemption power that could be proposed by taxpayers, and so the resource impact on Inland Revenue in having to deal with the proposed applications; and • any possible increase in judicial review applications. Level of suggestions Taxpayers would be able to suggest instances when the proposed power could be used. There is some uncertainty about the number of suggested applications that might be submitted by taxpayers, so there is some uncertainty about the resources Inland Revenue would need to process them. There is only a small risk that there would be a significant number of suggestions because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. 1 Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that although the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of resource for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. Increase in judicial review applications There is some uncertainty about the impact of any possible judicial review of the use, or failure to use, the proposed power. However, Inland Revenue considers the risk to be small because the application of any exemption is optional so taxpayers are unlikely to judicially review the application of the exemption power and the courts have been reluctant to allow judicial review challenges that are seen as collateral attacks on a tax assessment. 2 . Inland Revenue considers the risk is so small that it will not have any meaningful impact on the analysis. 1 The number of remedial referrals is contained in an internal database. 2 Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2011\] NZSC 158. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 5 Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 15 February 2018 Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 6 Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Taxation laws are public goods provided by the government. Only government action can remedy uncertainty caused by a legislative anomaly. If the government does not remedy the anomaly, then the taxpayer bears the risk of being found not to have complied with the law, or they must bear the unintended costs. New Zealand’s tax system is very complex, and it undergoes significant change regularly. The nature and volume of the tax law changes mean that unforeseen or unintended outcomes (legislative anomalies) arise often. This is likely to continue to be the case into the future given the increasing complexity of tax law and rapidly evolving business practices. Ideally, any such anomalies would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases this will be both necessary and achievable. However, under the current approach, it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. During that time, taxpayers are required to file different returns in different periods. For example, GST returns often need to be filed every two months and income tax returns every year. Taxpayers, therefore, might need to file several returns in the period during which an anomaly is being remedied. It is noted that similar problems arise in Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions (such as the administration of social policies). Clarifying that the care and management provision applies to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions is intended to be progressed as part of the Making Tax Simpler project to modernise the administration of social policy. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? The elements of the current regulatory system that are relevant for dealing with legislative anomalies are set out below: • In some situations, a purposive approach to interpreting the relevant legislation will mean that an anomaly that may arise on the plain reading of the relevant provision does not arise. However, sometimes the legislation cannot be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the policy intent. • Some anomalies can be remedied quickly through the legislative process if their discovery aligns with an existing bill. However, this does not often happen and so the average time to remedy a remedial issue is approximately 670 days. • The Commissioner also has some administrative flexibility under the existing care and management provision. The current provision does not allow the Commissioner to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. 3 Instead, the flexibility allows the 3 Interpretation statement “Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010). Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 7 Commissioner to decide not to allocate her resources to investigate situations when there is a known anomaly. This does not provide certainty for a taxpayer when Inland Revenue becomes aware of an issue because the Commissioner does not have a general power to suspend the application of the law. As it is only an administrative undertaking by the Commissioner, it provides limited protection for taxpayers who rely on it and so do not comply with the law. In those circumstances, the Commissioner would continue to have a duty to apply the law, even when it would produce outcomes that are not consistent with the purpose or object of the law. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The existing approach to resolving legislative anomalies in tax law can create uncertainties and is costly for taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The process creates uncertainties because when the legislation does not align with the intended policy, then taxpayers are unsure how to apply the law. To a limited extent this uncertainty can be resolved by binding rulings and other forms of advice. However, such advice can only clarify the meaning of the legislation and cannot resolve issues when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the intended policy. Taxpayers either have to comply with the legislation as interpreted either by themselves or the Commissioner, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. The uncertainty can also undermine the integrity of the tax system, by encouraging taxpayers to ignore the relevant tax law and comply with the policy. It can also be seen to undermine the rule of law when there is uncertainty about whether the law is intended to be complied with. The rule of law has been described as an elusive constitutional principle that includes at its heart the requirement that all persons (including the State) should be bound by the laws publicly made. 4 This has been developed further to suggest that the law should be clear, predictable, accessible and not made arbitrarily. When the only avenue to resolve the issue is through legislative amendment, then there can be a substantial period of uncertainty. This can create compliance costs for taxpayers by requiring them to seek advice either from an external advisor or Inland Revenue as to the correct approach to the relevant provision in the interim period. This also increases the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with the issue. 4 Ross Carter et al Subordinate Legislation in New Zealand (LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) 26. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 8 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There were no particular constraints on the scope of options considered. The options tie in with the broader work that is being undertaken to modernise the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, the work on updating the type of advice provided by Inland Revenue deals with situations when the legislation can be interpreted in a way that aligns with the policy intent. The work on advice is aimed at better communicating the Commissioner’s position to taxpayers through different forms of advice tailored to the needs of different taxpayers. The current issue deals with situations when the legislation cannot be interpreted consistently with the policy intent. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The problem affects all taxpayers and there are various stakeholders that have an interest. Significant consultation has been undertaken which has resulted in four options being developed. The consultation process is set out below. Problem identification Taxpayers highlighted the lack of speed and certainty in rectifying legislative anomalies in the Tax Administration for the 21 st century conference in June 2014. The conference’s purpose was to explore options for making tax easier (by reducing both compliance and administration costs) and increasing voluntary compliance balanced against core tax policy objectives such as raising revenue, and ensuring fairness and efficiency. First discussion document proposed options In response to the identified problem (and other problems), the Government released a discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act in 2015 which suggested two possible options: • extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions (referred to as “option 3” in this RIA); or • a clarification to the care and management provision to deal with some legislative anomalies (referred to as “option 4” in this RIA). The consultation included an online forum and presentations to submitters. The proposal to clarify the care and management provision was based on some criteria set out in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners; Ex parte Wilkinson \[2005\] UKHL 30, which discussed the scope of the Commissioners’ discretionary powers under the similarly worded United Kingdom care and management power. The option would allow the Commissioner to use her discretion in relation to: • minor legislative anomalies; • transitory legislative anomalies; Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 9 • cases when the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation because a statutory rule is difficult to formulate; • a long-standing established practice of both the Commissioner and taxpayers; • cases of unfairness at the margins. The discretion would only be exercised consistently with policy intent, and not allow for a policy-making ability. The exercise of the discretion would be time-limited and could not exceed three years. After this time, if the issue was on-going, an amendment to the primary legislation would be required. Consultation prior to the exercise of the discretion would be required, and any exercise of the discretion would be published to ensure transparency. The discretion would also be exercised only by Inland Revenue officers with an appropriate level of expertise. Submissions on the care and management proposal suggested various safeguards Submissions were generally supportive of the proposal to clarify the care and management provision. They commented that it should be a positive step for taxpayers and ensure the Commissioner had the ability to direct her resources where they were most needed. It was also noted that the proposal needed to be supported by a change in mind-set within Inland Revenue to support use of the care and management provision. Submissions suggested: • Any enhanced administrative flexibility should only be exercised in favour of the taxpayer, and the amendment should expressly state this rule to avoid any doubt. • Any care and management power should be guided by a set of principles – including those in sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act. • There needed to be a principle which establishes whether the policy is clear enough such that the Commissioner could depart from the ordinary meaning of the words – for example, “persons reading the relevant legislation would in most cases agree what the policy intent of the legislation is”. • A balancing of a collection of factors was suggested, including: cost to the taxpayer; cost to the Commissioner; a ceiling of an amount of tax at issue if the legislation is applied as written (compared to if the Commissioner has the flexibility to take another approach); and perhaps a time period. Submissions reflected in proposed safeguards and options The submissions were taken into account in developing a refined proposal that was consulted on in a subsequent Government discussion document, Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act (December 2016). The consultation included an online forum and workshops with submitters. The revised proposal retained the listed criteria and set out the relevant safeguards that would apply, including that it would be optional for taxpayers. The submissions on the specific criteria and safeguards suggested: • While there was support for each of the listed criteria for when the discretion could be exercised, there was some uncertainty about the scope of the criteria. • There were differing views on whether the exercise of the discretion should be limited to taxpayer-friendly situations or whether it should be optional for taxpayers to apply. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 10 • The discretion should be applied consistently and only in appropriate circumstances, but that these safeguards should not impede the exercise of the discretion in an effective manner. • Guidance was needed to ensure taxpayers had a clear understanding of how the provision would apply. • The power should not be exercised if it would not be in the public interest to do so. • The exercise or non-exercise of the discretion should be a reviewable decision. • There should be some flexibility around the requirement to consult as whilst consultation might be beneficial in some cases, in many cases it would result in significant delay of the effective exercise of the discretion. • The requirement to publish the exercise of the discretion should be subject to a public interest requirement. Submitters proposed other options A concern was raised that not all taxpayers would have access to decisions made by the Commissioner under an extended care and management power, which would result in a body of private law. Some submitters suggested exploring further the option of granting the Commissioner a regulation-making power in the form of disallowable legislative instruments like those proposed in Australia. Alternatively, it was suggested that the Commissioner should be allowed to anticipate legislative changes by issuing interpretation statements that then apply as binding interpretations. Submitters, and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, supported having a range of options by which the discretion could be exercised (a “tool box approach”). This approach is similar to the suite of powers available to the Financial Markets Authority under the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 and Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Crown Law Office was concerned about the implications for the rule of law of the proposed extension to the Commissioner’s care and management power, but noted that those concerns were, to a limited extent, addressed by the specific safeguards. The Crown Law Office considered that it would be preferable if the power could be exercised only by Order in Council. These concerns and comments led to the development of the proposal referred to as “option 5” in this RIA. Workshop with submitters Following the submissions on the discussion document, and the comments above, Inland Revenue organised a workshop with submitters (including Crown Law) on the various proposals. The discussion focused on option 5. During the workshop, submitters suggested: • The proposal should adopt a principle-based approach. This would allow the discretion to be used when the legislation did not align with the intended policy Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 11 without being limited by any specific criteria. • There should be a tool-box of options by which legislative anomalies could be dealt with, including Orders in Council, Commissioner-made determinations, and administrative action. • Any exercise of the discretion should be optional for taxpayers to apply. Summary The consultation comments were taken into account in developing the options discussed below. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? There are five options considered in this analysis: • Option 1: Address legislative anomalies using existing processes (status quo). • Option 2: Increase resources to address legislative anomalies using existing processes. Increasing the resources directed at remedying legislative anomalies would involve redirecting existing resources or increasing the resources directed to law development. This option does not require legislation and could be used in conjunction with any of the other options. • Option 3: Provide for more discretionary provisions in legislation. This option would extend the Commissioner’s current discretionary or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions. It would provide the Commissioner with increased administrative flexibility to deal with legislative anomalies in specific situations. • Option 4: Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. This option would extend the Commissioner’s care and management provision to provide some more administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Option 5: Determinations and regulations to temporarily remedy anomalies (preferred option). This option would provide a power to make regulations, determinations or take administrative action to remedy a legislative anomaly. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The overarching objective is to reduce compliance costs and administrative costs by providing earlier certainty to taxpayers and Inland Revenue about the application of tax law when there is a legislative anomaly that results in an inconsistency with policy intent and practice. The options have been assessed against the objective and the following criteria: • Sustainability: The options should support the rule of law and maintain the integrity Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 12 of the tax system. • Compliance costs: Compliance costs for taxpayers should be minimised as far as practicable. • Administrative costs: Administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as practicable. The objective of the proposal is to balance the compliance cost and administrative cost reduction objective against the sustainability objective. This would be achieved through the limitations included in the options considered. Overlaps between criteria There is likely to be an overlap between reductions in compliance costs for taxpayers and reductions in administrative costs for Inland Revenue, in that a reduction in the former is likely to cause a reduction in the later under the relevant options. This is because the simpler the option for taxpayers the less likely they will need advice from Inland Revenue. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Some submitters suggested that one option could be to re-interpret the current care and management provision, so as to provide the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility without the need for a legislative amendment. The current proposal suggests retaining the current care and management provision but supplementing it with further flexibility in certain circumstances. As a result, the proposal does not prevent a broader interpretation being taken of the scope of the current provision. However, it is considered that while the current provision does provide the Commissioner with flexibility about the allocation of her resources, it does not provide her with the flexibility to administratively remedy legislative anomalies. Further, it is considered that the scope of any such power, and the safeguards that would apply, should be specified in the legislation to protect the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. As a result, the option of re- interpreting the current provision was ruled out because it would risk the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law.

No action Option 1 Option 2 (Providing greater resources) Option 3 (Enact more discretionary provisions) Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Option 5 (Determinations, regulations, and admin action) (Preferred option) Criterion (Sustainability) 0 0 Although remedying all issues through legislative amendment would seem to support this criterion, the lengthy legislative process would mean taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law for a substantial time . This would harm the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. + This option would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law, but it would be difficult to predict any issues so the problem is likely to still arise in many cases. As a result, in most cases taxpayers would be required to follow either the policy or the law, harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. - This option would support sustainability by remedying anomalies quicker. However, it would be at the discretion of the Commissioner and it would not be subject to Parliamentary oversight. + This option would remedy the anomalies and would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, thereby supporting the rule of law. This option would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting the integrity of the tax system. Criterion (Compliance costs) 0 + It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention woul d be paid to problematic issues but it would still take time to resolve, so taxpayers would incur costs working out what to do in the interim. 0 – It would only be effective when the problem could be anticipated so taxpayers would still likely have significant compliance costs in most cases. Relying on discretions would involve moving away from the efficiency objective of self- assessment, and so would incur further compliance costs for taxpayers than the status quo. + The speed by which the issues could be resolved would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, the remedy would not provide legal certainty so taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the consequences. + Anomalies could be resolved quickly, and this would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs. However, taxpayers would incur som e costs associated with understanding the process and choosing whether to apply the remedy or the black letter of the law. Criterion (Administrative costs) 0 - Devoting more resources to the policy development process would divert resources from elsewhere, or require more funding. - Additional administrative costs in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the issue is within a discretionary power. + The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs but there would be risks of challenges to the use of the discretion. + This option would reduce administration costs by quickly remedying anomalies. However, there would be some increased costs for Inland Revenue in deciding whether the discretion should be exercised.

However, under the current approach it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. It is not clear that increasing the policy resources would substantially reduce this time period, as it is mainly driven by the legislative process. The time period involves the lead-in time to get a remedial item added to a bill (including the relevant reporting requirements) and the passage of the bill through the House. As a result, it is likely that even with more policy resources it might still take a similar time to resolve the relevant legislative anomalies. The substantial time taken by the legislative process would mean taxpayers either comply with the legislation as interpreted, so incurring unintended costs or compliance requirements; or comply with the intended policy and risk being penalised for not complying with the law. This would result in no change from the status quo for the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. The uncertainty makes it harder for taxpayers to organise their affairs, invest or plan for the future. Compliance costs Under this option there would be some reduction in taxpayers’ compliance costs because more attention would be paid to problematic issues, and so taxpayers could be better informed about the correct approach. However, the Commissioner could only provide administrative guidance prior to the legislation being enacted and so taxpayers would not have any certainty about the outcome in that period. Taxpayers would still need to decide during the time taken to remedy the problem whether they would follow the existing law or the policy. Often this would require taxpayers to consult a professional advisor or Inland Revenue to work out what to do in the interim. In some circumstances, taxpayers and Inland Revenue might still end up in disputes that are inconsistent with both parties’ expectations. This would impose compliance costs on taxpayers. Administrative costs Increasing resources, or directing existing resources towards fixing anomalies, both come with an opportunity cost for Inland Revenue for other functions those resources could have been directed towards. As a result, this option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Overall assessment Increasing resources to policy development to fix more anomalies would result in some compliance gains for taxpayers while maintaining the sustainability under the status quo. However, the option would increase administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Option 3 (Provide for more discretionary provisions) Sustainability Enacting the discretionary provisions as part of the primary legislation would support the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. However, if an issue can be foreseen then they are currently addressed in the primary legislation. This might be through a specific discretion or by allowing determinations to be made on the relevant issue. As a result, it is Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 16 considered that the current problem is unlikely to be one that can be foreseen. Taxpayers, therefore, would still be required to follow either the policy or the law in most cases, so harming the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. Compliance costs Given that the problem really relates to those situations when it is not possible to anticipate the likely issue, adopting this option is unlikely to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers compared with the status quo. In addition, relying on Commissioner discretions would mean that taxpayers would not have certainty from the legislation and would need to consider when the Commissioner would exercise her discretion. There may also be compliance costs in applying to the Commissioner to exercise her discretion or make a determination and the approach could in any case be inconsistent with a tax system based on self-assessment. Administrative costs This option would impose additional administrative costs on the Commissioner because she would be required to consider whether to exercise a particular discretion in a situation. The consideration of the use of the discretion would require resources. The amount of resources would depend on the number of discretionary provisions and the number of possible situations when the discretion could apply. As a result, the more discretionary provisions included in the Revenue Acts to deal with anticipated anomalies, the more resources the Commissioner would potentially have to commit to the various issues. Overall assessment This option would meet the criteria for the issues that could be identified in advance. However, Inland Revenue considers that the majority of anomalies could not be foreseen, and this option would not satisfy the criteria for those issues. Option 4 (Administrative flexibility in limited circumstances) Sustainability Option 4 would reduce sustainability because it would be subject to challenge and would raise rule of law concerns that the Commissioner was not bound to the published law. The proposed safeguards would limit the concerns to some extent. Specifically: • The limited criteria, and the requirement that any exercise of the discretion must be consistent with existing policy, would mean that the scope of the discretion is very limited; • The requirement to consult on any exercise of the discretion would reduce the risk of challenge because concerns could be dealt with before any exercise of the discretion; and • The time limitation would mean any exemptions would only be temporary, which would reduce rule of law concerns. Compliance costs Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 17 This option would allow anomalies to be remedied quickly. This would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them guidance on the intended policy outcome. However, as the remedy would not be legislative and would only be administrative, it would not provide legal certainty for taxpayers. This would mean that taxpayers might still need to seek advice as to the likelihood of the remedy being overturned. There would also be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up- to-date with any exercise of the discretion. Taxpayers would also have to monitor any challenges to the exercise of the discretion. Administrative costs The ease of remedying anomalies would reduce administrative costs for Inland Revenue in having to provide less advice about the anomaly, and having less disputes about outcomes that were not intended. However, there would be some increase in administrative costs in having to set-up and administer the new process. This would include providing guidance to taxpayers about how the new process would work, although this is expected to taper over time. There might also be additional costs from any challenges to the exercise of the administrative power. Even so, it would be optional for taxpayers to apply, and so the risk would be small. Overall assessment This option would reduce compliance and administrative costs but could undermine the sustainability of the tax system. The lack of any parliamentary oversight of the process might raise rule of law issues. Option 5 (Determinations, regulations, and administrative action) Sustainability Using Orders in Council or disallowable determinations to remedy anomalies would support the sustainability of the process of remedying the anomalies by enabling parliamentary oversight of the process. Parliamentary oversight would be provided by the disallowance process and the oversight of the Regulations Review Committee. In many cases, the issue would still need to be resolved through the normal legislative process, with the new process providing a temporary bridge until that could occur. This option would support the rule of law by enabling Parliament to disallow any remedies that were considered to be the proper domain of Parliament. The temporary nature of the remedies and the fact that they do not override the primary law also support the sustainability of the system. The optionality of the remedies would mean taxpayers could choose the best option so supporting self-assessment and the integrity of the tax system. Compliance costs This option would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by providing them with faster remedies for legislative anomalies. As noted previously, this would overcome a specific issue raised by taxpayers. It would reduce the need for taxpayers to seek advice either from professional advisors or Inland Revenue on the operation of the relevant provision (when it seems to be inconsistent with the intended policy). It reduces the risks for taxpayers of getting it wrong, and so encourages investment and planning for the future. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 18 The option would increase compliance costs for taxpayers to a limited extent. There would be a small increase in compliance costs in having to become familiar with the new process, and having to keep up-to-date with any exercise of the discretion. It would increase the overall complexity of the tax system. This option would be more complicated than Option 4 given the three possible remedies. However, the use of regulations and disallowable determinations under Option 5 would make it easier to keep track of any remedies, so reducing the increased compliance costs to some extent. Some compliance costs may be incurred by taxpayers in having to submit on the draft remedies during the process. Finally, taxpayers would need to determine whether any remedy would be favourable for them in their own circumstances, which would increase compliance costs for them. Inland Revenue considers the reduction in compliance costs from providing certainty for taxpayers more quickly under this option would significantly outweigh the increased compliance costs. Administrative costs The option would reduce the overall administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Providing greater certainty for taxpayers more quickly would reduce the need for them to contact Inland Revenue seeking advice and would prevent disputes arising when the legislation does not align with the policy. This would reduce the resources Inland Revenue needed to commit to such issues. As previously noted, the average time taken to remedy an anomaly spans several return periods so providing certainty to taxpayers sooner could reduce the resources Inland Revenue needs to assist to amend previous tax positions. There will be an increase in administrative costs for Inland Revenue in establishing the process and processing any suggested applications of the power from Inland Revenue staff or taxpayers. The Australian experience would suggest there would not be a large number of applications so this cost is not expected to be large. When the anomaly needed to be fixed subsequently through the normal legislative process, the costs incurred in providing a temporary solution could be seen as a duplication, but many of the subsequent elements of the process would not need to be repeated. For example, if the problem had been identified and a remedy consulted on before the making of a regulation, then it may not need to be repeated to the full extent when the permanent legislative amendment is being subsequently proposed. Overall assessment Inland Revenue prefers this option. It would support the sustainability of the tax system by incorporating Parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process and the Regulations Review Committee. The option would also reduce compliance and administrative costs. As a result, this option best meets the stated criteria. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 19 Section 5: Conclusions 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue prefers option 5 for the following reasons: • It provides a process by which legislative anomalies could be quickly dealt with, while supporting the integrity of the tax system and the rule of law. • It would reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs in dealing with legislative anomalies, while aligning with the self-assessment system. • It would reduce the administrative costs for Inland Revenue in dealing with anomalies. Although there would be some increased costs in identifying and providing a remedy for the relevant issues, the current number of remedial issues and the Australian experience with their similar provision, suggest these costs would be relatively small. • It is the option most favoured by submitters because it has sufficiently broad scope, it is optional for taxpayers to apply, and because it has appropriate safeguards in place. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (taxpayers) Cost of gaining an initial understanding of how the new process would operate.

There is a risk of adverse public perception that tax laws are being changed through Order in Council, through a determination made by the Commissioner or by administrative action. Such a perception could undermine the integrity of the tax system and the perception of the rule of law. This risk would be mitigated by several elements. The most important element would be the fact that the tax laws would not be overridden, and it would be optional for taxpayers to apply any remedial actions. Further, any substantive issues would be subject to parliamentary disallowance, so protecting the role of parliament in the process. In addition, any remedial actions would be only temporary and would expire in three years. Another risk could be that the public perceive that lobby groups influence issues which are considered. The consultation and publication requirements would mitigate this risk to some extent. Further, the fact that any regulations or determination made under the power would be subject to disallowance would add to the transparency. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The preferred option should deliver, over time, a stream of benefits in terms of lower compliance and administrative costs that are in excess of its costs or negative outcomes. The optional nature of the preferred option means that it has the least adverse impact on property rights and individual autonomy. It conforms to established legal and constitutional principles and is similar in nature to the statutory remedial power recently enacted in Australia. The empowering provision under the preferred option would have scope to evolve in response to changing circumstances or new information on the system’s performance. The three methods of exercising the remedial power in the preferred option provide that flexibility to evolve. Non-monetised benefits - Medium High Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 22 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The preferred option will need to be implemented by a legislative amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Specifically, an empowering provision would need to be enacted to allow regulations or determinations to be made. The amendment could be included in the next available tax bill. The amendment could apply from the date of enactment. Explanation of the amendment and its effect could be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill received Royal assent. The implementation of the preferred option would require an internal Inland Revenue process to determine if a recommendation should be made to use the power, a determination made, or administration action taken. The internal process will be developed in conjunction with the organisational design process that is currently being undertaken within Inland Revenue. Taxpayers and agents will be able to suggest cases when it could be appropriate to use the power. They will also be involved during the consultation process examining any proposed use of the power. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There is a risk that there could be a large number of issues raised by taxpayers with Inland Revenue that need to be considered under the proposed power. However, as noted above, this risk is considered to be low because there is evidence of the number of legislative anomalies that are discovered each year and the number suitable for the remedial power is likely to be a subset of those issues. Inland Revenue received 140 referrals from all sources for remedial amendments between October 2015 and October 2017. Only a small subset of those referrals is likely to be appropriate for the proposed option. Furthermore, under the similar Australian provision only approximately 22 applications were received in the first six months. Of those only two were considered appropriate for the remedial power. It is acknowledged that while the Australian provision is similar to the preferred option discussed below, the differences in the tax systems might lead to a different number of suggestions being made. Overall, the evidence suggests that the proposed option is unlikely to require a significant amount of the resources for Inland Revenue to manage the process, and the analysis proceeds on that basis. There is a small risk of an increase in judicial review but as discussed above this risk is considered to be small. Impact Statement: Making Tax Simpler: Proposals for modernising the Tax Administration Act – flexibility for dealing with legislative anomalies | 23 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed changes in the first 12 months of operation. The monitoring would involve a review of any regulations and determinations made, and administrative action taken, under the empowering provision within that period to see whether they were consistent with the intended policy. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy (and subsequently social policy administered by Inland Revenue) in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following enactment would be added to the tax policy work programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. The Regulations Review Committee would have a role in monitoring and reviewing any regulations or determinations (being disallowable instruments) made. The committee examines all regulations, investigates complaints about regulations, and examines proposed regulation-making powers in bills for consistency with good legislative practice.
