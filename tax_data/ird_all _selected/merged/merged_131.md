(GloBE) tax rules Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 15 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OVERVIEW The Bill proposes to implement the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) tax rules in New Zealand. There were 17 submissions received in relation to this proposal. Eight of the 17 submissions expressed support generally for the proposal. Five of these submissions also expressed concern about aspects of the proposal. Key concerns raised by submitters related to:  referencing the GloBE rules in New Zealand legislation  automatic updating of New Zealand rules when additional OECD guidance is published  application date  tax liability  compliance cost  exchange of information  privacy, and  penalties. Officials recommend making the following changes to the Bill as a result of the submissions:  Clarify that the Model Rules must be interpreted in accordance with the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance, meaning that in some cases the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance will override the Model Rules.  Provide for companies leaving a group to be released from joint and several liability for that group’s GloBE rules’ taxes.  Clarify that foreign tax credits are allowed for tax paid overseas under a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT). Officials also submit that the legislation should explicitly provide that binding rulings can be made on the application of the GloBE rules just as they can on other tax laws. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 16 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] SUBMISSIONS SUPPORTING THE PROPOSAL Clauses 6, 7, 21, 44, 45, 48, 51 to 54, 59(4), (5), (11) and (12), 63, 68, 69, 72, 74, 75 and 77 Submission (Baucher Consulting Ltd, Bryce Jensen, Cantin Consulting, EY, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, PwC, Russell McVeagh, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Eight of the 17 submissions expressed support for the proposal to introduce the GloBE rules. Five of these submissions also expressed concerns with aspects of the proposal. (Cantin Consulting, EY, PwC, Russell McVeagh, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Generally, the reason for the support was because the GloBE rules were considered the best available option to address concerns regarding the level of tax paid by multinational enterprises (MNEs). (Baucher Consulting Ltd, Bryce Jensen, Cantin Consulting, EY, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Others supported the proposal because a significant number of other jurisdictions will be enacting the GloBE rules. Introducing the rules in New Zealand will help reduce the costs that would be incurred by New Zealand headquartered MNEs that would otherwise be required to comply with the Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR), often in two or more countries. (PwC, Russell McVeagh) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 17 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] REFERENCING THE GLOBE RULES IN NEW ZEALAND LEGISLATION Clauses 44, 63 and 77 Issue: Incorporation of GloBE rules by reference Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Cantin Consulting, EY, Patterson Legal, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC, Regulations Review Committee, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Some submitters supported the incorporation by reference approach because it should reduce translation errors and ensure New Zealand’s domestic rules comply with the Inclusive Framework’s rules. (Cantin Consulting) Others accepted the proposed approach but submitted that the statute should specify who the rules apply to (see Issue: Compliance costs below). (OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) The rest of the submissions were generally concerned that incorporating the GloBE rules by reference would undermine New Zealand’s sovereignty and autonomy. They made the following points: a. The Committee should understand how other countries (such as Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) intend to enact this tax, as well as seek advice on whether this is appropriate under section 22 of the Constitution Act 1986. (Patterson Legal) b. It is not clear that the incorporation by reference approach will include certain components of the GloBE rules, in particular the transitional safe harbour provided for in Chapter 1 of the December 2022 document titled Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. (KPMG) c. The GloBE rules should be repeated in New Zealand legislative material to avoid ceding sovereignty to the OECD and to give more scope to ensure the legislation does not have unintended consequences, although this would involve more work for Inland Revenue. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) d. Incorporation by repeating the rules in New Zealand legislative material would also improve accessibility of the rules and scrutiny of future amendments. (Mayne Wetherell) e. When incorporating external materials like the GloBE rules into domestic legislation, there needs to be a mechanism to clarify whether changes to the external materials are to be applied or disapplied in New Zealand as they arise. The default position is that, Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 18 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] under section 66(2)(a) of the Legislation Act 2019, changes to external materials have no effect unless they are specifically incorporated by secondary legislation. There is a mechanism of sorts addressing changes to Commentary and interpretation materials through a regulation-making power in proposed section 226G in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) (which also has issues), but there is no similar provision for changes to the GloBE rules themselves. The legislation would be improved by specifically providing for this mechanism in section HP 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA), and further, clarifying that a change to the external GloBE rules will not be effective until it is implemented. (Regulations Review Committee) Comment In response to the submission that the scope of the GloBE rules (who they apply to) should be specified in the legislation, setting out the scope of the rules in New Zealand legislation would require significant drafting to be comprehensive. While the core of the rule can be shortly stated (for instance, “MNE groups with €750 million or more turnover in at least two of the four previous fiscal years”) it relies on definitions that are lengthy and at the margins complex (such as “of Consolidated Financial Statements”, “Constituent Entity” and “MNE Group”) and modifications (dealing with changes in group membership in Article 6.1), such that incorporating them into New Zealand law directly would itself create undesirable drafting complexity. In response to the other submissions referred to above: a. Officials understand that Switzerland has incorporated the rules by reference, but we are not aware of any other countries that have done so. As to the constitutionality of the incorporation by reference approach, officials point out that insofar as the Bill incorporates into New Zealand the GloBE rules as they exist on the date of enactment, Parliament can be presumed to know those rules. b. It is clear that the guidance that includes the transitional safe harbour is Agreed Administrative Guidance. It satisfies the definition in the Model Rules of being “guidance on the interpretation or administration of the GloBE rules issued by the Inclusive Framework”. c. Incorporation by repetition would need to include both the Model Rules (68 pages) and the Commentary (225 pages when initially released, and now materially longer following the release of two tranches of Agreed Administrative Guidance). This would require significant resources and risks the New Zealand legislation diverging from the Model Rules. d. It is important that New Zealand’s rules do not depart in any material way from the Model Rules, so the benefits of scrutiny at a New Zealand level are perhaps overstated. New Zealand does have input through the Inclusive Framework. The process of generating Agreed Administrative Guidance also generally involves an opportunity for input from affected businesses. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 19 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] e. The proposed defined term “global anti-base erosion model rules” in section YA 1 of the ITA provides for changes to the Model Rules (other than to the 15% minimum rate) to flow through automatically into New Zealand’s domestic law. Section 66(2)(a) of the Legislation Act does not apply because the ITA is primary legislation, not secondary legislation. Recommendation Officials recommend that the submissions against incorporation by reference, and the submission concerning the flow-through of Model Rules changes to domestic legislation, be declined. Clause 44 and 77 Issue: Automatic update for future amendments (Cantin Consulting, EY, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Law Society, Patterson Legal, PwC) Submission One submission considered the proposed automatic update approach to incorporating future changes to the GloBE rules to be a sensible and a practical way of complying with the Inclusive Framework’s requirements. However, it was not opposed to requiring an Order in Council to explicitly adopt changes so there is parliamentary scrutiny of any changes. (Cantin Consulting) All other submissions on the proposed approach of automatic incorporation opposed it, taking the view that some level of parliamentary scrutiny should be required, whether this was by Order in Council or by primary legislation. (EY, KPMG, Mayne Wetherell, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) Some submissions said that the Select Committee should seek advice on whether it is appropriate, under section 22 of the Constitution Act 1986 and other constitutional conventions, for amendments to the Model Rules to amend New Zealand tax law. If it is, there should be a process in the statute for Parliament or Inland Revenue to notify that there has been a change to the Model Rules. (Patterson Legal) The New Zealand Law Society submitted that the Bill could be improved by including a provision that more clearly and expressly addresses the question of future amendments to the GloBE rules and Commentary. PwC submitted that in any event, Inland Revenue should issue guidance specifically as to how the rules will apply in practice, particularly if New Zealand will incorporate any changes on a retrospective basis. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 20 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment An automatic update approach has been proposed for adopting future amendments to the GloBE rules because it is a sensible and practical way to comply with the requirements of the rules. Requiring parliamentary scrutiny for future amendments when the domestic rules need to be substantially the same as the Model Rules to be qualifying would be resource intensive. The proposed automatic update approach is not unique in a New Zealand tax context. For example, there are tax laws within the ITA that rely on amounts calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards. These accounting standards may be updated from time-to-time resulting in changes to tax rules and regimes. Section 22 of the Constitution Act 1996 provides that it is not lawful for the Crown to levy a tax except by or under an Act of Parliament. In keeping with this requirement, the GloBE rules have been included in a Bill that, if passed, will become an Act of Parliament once it receives Royal assent. The intention is that future changes to the GloBE rules are adopted unless they are specifically made non-applicable by an Order in Council. The regulation-making power is in section 226G of the TAA. The reference in the opening words of section HP 3(3) of the ITA, that the GloBE rules apply “at a time”, is not entirely consistent with the language of section HP 3(3)(b)(ii) that the rules apply for a fiscal year. Officials agree this could be made clearer. Recommendation Officials recommend that the submission, that the opening words of section HP 3(3) should be amended for clarity, be accepted. Officials recommend that the other submissions on automatic update be declined. Clause 44 Issue: Consistency with OECD Commentary and guidance (Cantin Consulting) Submission Proposed new section HP 3 of the ITA provides that the GloBE rules are treated as applying “consistently with” the most recent Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance developed by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. The submission queried whether the current wording would achieve the desired policy intention. In particular, “consistently with” does not necessarily mean “as modified by”. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 21 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials agree that the current drafting of proposed section HP 3 may not achieve the desired outcome, which is that the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance developed by the Inclusive Framework would prevail over the Model Rules if inconsistent (which is not generally expected to be the case). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clauses 44, 45 and 74 Issue: Application of terms used in GloBE rules in domestic legislation Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) Incorporating external material into domestic legislation through reference could result in ambiguity regarding how definitions for terms used in the external materials apply to New Zealand. The Bill includes terms, such as “MNE group”, that are defined within the GloBE rules. However, definitions for such terms are not explicitly provided in the amendments to primary legislation. While the intention may be for the definitions included in the external materials to apply, this is not made clear. Additionally, the term “ultimate owner” is used in new section 139AAB, when the GloBE rules use the term “Ultimate Parent Entity” for the same concept. This inconsistency may also create ambiguity. The Committee may wish to consider whether definitions for terms connected to the GloBE rules, Commentary or Agreed Administrative Guidance, should be explicitly included in domestic legislation. Comment Proposed new section HP 5 of the ITA (see clauses 44 and 45 of the Bill) provides that, in the application of the relevant provisions of the ITA and TAA, a term defined in the GloBE rules and used in those provisions has the meaning that it has at the time under the GloBE rules, as modified by proposed new section HP 3(2) of the ITA. This drafting approach was based on precedents in sections 185O and 185S of the TAA, which relate to the Common Standard on Reporting and Due Diligence for Financial Account Information and the Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig Economy, respectively. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 22 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 23 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Effectiveness of GloBE rules Submission (Cantin Consulting, Tax Justice Aotearoa) The GloBE rules generally require accounting profits to be attributed to a country for them to be taxed (although a UTPR may allow a country to tax profits not attributed to that country). In a simplified model, (global) accounting profits are based on use of resources, use of intellectual property and delivery to customers – profits are allocated based on an arms- length standard. This limits the profits recognised in a “source” or “market” country. The GloBE rules do not change this; therefore, source countries may not consider the solution advantageous. There are calls for the United Nations to promote an alternative. (Cantin Consulting) It is not clear whether a particular country will benefit from the GloBE rules, especially developing or poorer countries. Some countries may use a domestic minimum tax (provided for in the GloBE rules) to the detriment of other countries. The Select Committee should note the position of such agencies as Oxfam, Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) and others. (Tax Justice Aotearoa) Comment The GloBE rules do not prevent countries offering low rates or incentives to attract real investment. The submission raised in relation to the allocation of accounting profits is an issue that is outside the scope of the proposed rules. Officials note that the issue around the allocation of profits may be addressed by Pillar One of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. Officials note that a domestic minimum tax cannot be implemented to the detriment of another country because it is the right of a country to tax the income arising in that country, whether by way of a domestic minimum tax or otherwise. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 24 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 7 Issue: Tax treaty override Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) The submitters do not support the proposed treaty override provision because there is a risk that other countries could respond negatively. For example, other countries could impose tariffs or revoke a tax treaty. New Zealand’s approach to addressing the interaction between double tax agreements and the GloBE rules should be consistent with the approach taken by treaty partners. The GloBE rules are consistent with tax treaties making an override of treaties unnecessary. This view is supported by comments made by the OECD. (OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) Comment Tax treaties generally prohibit a country from taxing the income of a non-resident unless it arises in the country. However, the treaties generally permit a country to tax its own residents as it likes. There is an argument that the UTPR violates the first (prohibition) rule. Although it taxes a resident member of a multinational group, it often does so on the basis that the income of a non-resident member not arising in the tax-imposing country has been under-taxed. As noted by submitters, the OECD’s position is that it considers the GloBE rules to be treaty compliant, because of the second (permissive) rule described above. Officials agree with this view. Also, it is clearly the intention of the Inclusive Framework of around 140 countries, including the United States, that countries should apply the UTPR. Further, the proposals in the Bill will only come into effect if a critical mass of countries adopts the GloBE rules, including the UTPR. As a result, Officials consider there is a low risk that another country will respond negatively if New Zealand applies the UTPR, with one possible exception. One country that might respond negatively to the GloBE rules is the United States. While the current administration supports the rules, a section of the Republican party does not. So there is a small risk that the United States may respond negatively to the introduction of the UTPR itself, for example, by imposing trade tariffs. Given the number of countries introducing a UTPR, officials believe this risk is very small. The purpose of the proposed treaty override provision is to avoid unproductive disputes being raised by MNEs that may seek to challenge the imposition of tax by New Zealand under the UTPR. Officials note that section BH 1(4) of the ITA already provides for treaties to be overridden in certain circumstances. For example, sections BG 1 and GB 54 (which relate to tax avoidance) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 25 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and section RF 11C (which relates to interest paid by non-resident companies to non- residents) override tax treaties. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 26 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] APPLICATION DATE AND IMPLEMENTATION Clauses 2 and 44 Issue: Income Inclusion Rule application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PwC) New Zealand’s rules should only apply once the UTPR starts to apply in a critical mass of other countries. This is when New Zealand headquartered MNEs will otherwise have compliance costs in other countries. This will be from 1 January 2025 at the earliest. Comment It is now clear that a critical mass of countries will be adopting an income inclusion rule (IIR) from 1 January 2024 and a UTPR from 1 January 2025. The effective date for New Zealand’s GloBE rules can therefore be set in the Bill, rather than left to be determined by Order in Council. New Zealand’s IIR should be effective no later than 1 January 2025. There is an issue as to whether the IIR should be made effective from 1 January 2024. Retrospective application of taxes is generally not desirable, which is a strong argument in favour of a 1 January 2025 start date for the IIR. The effective date for the UTPR cannot be earlier than 1 January 2025, and now that it seems clear that the rules will be adopted internationally, this date can be specified. A later start date is feasible for the domestic IIR (DIIR). The Transitional UTPR Safe Harbour, published in July 2023, means that no country will impose its UTPR on any under-taxed New Zealand-sourced income of a New Zealand headquartered MNE until 1 January 2026 at the earliest. Therefore, implementing the DIIR a year later will have no adverse impact on New Zealand MNEs, but it will have the positive impact of giving them more time to prepare their compliance capabilities. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the Bill accordingly specify a 1 January 2025 start date for the IIR and UTPR and a 1 January 2026 start date for the DIIR. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 27 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clauses 2 and 44 Issue: Critical mass Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) The submitters generally support the proposal to only implement the GloBE rules in New Zealand if a critical mass of other countries also does so. Clear guidance is needed on what constitutes a critical mass. (KPMG, PWC) New Zealand’s major trading partners should be included in the critical mass – Australia in particular. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, OliverShaw Ltd) Comment The Order in Council process for setting an effective date allowed the Government the flexibility to determine a critical mass. However, as set out above, subsequent events mean that this process is not necessary, and the submissions referred to on this point will not be relevant if the Bill specifies the effective dates for the components of the GloBE rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, noting officials’ comment above. Clause 44 Issue: Ambiguity regarding “declared” versus “deemed” implementation Submission (Regulations Review Committee) Section HP 1(1) of the ITA sets out a general obligation to pay tax under the GloBE rules. Section HP 1(2) provides an exclusion to this obligation, stating that tax is not payable in accordance with a component of the GloBE rules set out in section HP 4(2): (a) if a date has not been declared \[in regulations\] for the implementation in New Zealand of the component; or (b) for fiscal years starting before the date declared \[in regulations\] for the implementation of the component otherwise. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 28 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section HP 4(3) states that an Order in Council may “deem” a component of the GloBE rules to have been implemented in New Zealand on a date in the past if the date is not earlier than 1 January 2024 and the first day of the calendar year in which the date is declared. This use of "deemed" implementation in section HP 4(3) creates confusion with section HP 1. It is not immediately clear whether a date of “deemed” implementation is effective for the purposes of the section HP 1(2) carve-out removing liability to pay tax, which is based on “declared” implementation. This creates ambiguity in terms of when liability arises during a "deemed” implementation period. The Finance and Expenditure Committee should consider whether section HP 4(3) should be amended to include the term “declare”, to avoid ambiguity regarding liability under section HP 1(2) and (2). Comment Officials agree that using the word “declare” in section HP 4(3) would resolve the ambiguity. However, officials are now proposing to set effective dates for the rules, which, if agreed to, would result in the deletion of the Order in Council mechanism and the ambiguous wording in question. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, noting officials’ comment. Clause 2 Issue: Lack of backstop commencement date Submission (Regulations Review Committee) Clause 2 is the commencement provision of the Bill. Various parts of the Bill commence at different times. Clauses 44, 66(3) and (5), 68, 69, 70(2), 71(2), 72, and 75 come into force on a single date to be set by Order in Council. All these clauses provide for the dates when the GloBE rules commence to apply. However, there are no time limits in clause 2 for commencement by Order in Council. Often, a time range is given for such matters, including both or either of a date by which the order must be made ("long stop" or cutoff date). The explanatory note for the Bill states that the reason for the commencement of these provisions by Order in Council is so they can be brought into force once a critical mass of other countries has adopted the GloBE rules. Therefore, flexibility is needed. However, lawmakers should still consider using a "long stop" date, because doing so maintains parliamentary sovereignty and avoids the possibility of the executive intentionally or unintentionally frustrating the law-making process. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 29 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment For the GloBE rules to be effective, a critical mass of countries must adopt them. It is therefore preferable that the rules do not come into effect in New Zealand until this occurs. However, as noted in the officials’ comment on the submission Issue: Income Inclusion Rule application date, it is now clear that a critical mass of countries will be adopting their GloBE rules from 1 January 2025. Accordingly, officials propose that a hard effective date of 1 January 2025 be set for New Zealand’s IIR and UTPR, and 1 January 2026 for the DIIR, replacing the Order in Council mechanism. Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting, however, that its substantive intent is achieved by officials’ proposal to replace the Order in Council mechanism altogether with set effective dates for the GloBE rules. Clauses 44 and 77 Issue: General problems with application and implementation Submission (Regulations Review Committee) New section 226G in the TAA provides for the making of regulations that disapply changes to the OECD-published Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance to the GloBE rules. New section HP 3(3)(b) in the ITA states the default position that the GloBE rules are to be interpreted in accordance with the most recent Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance. a. Section HP 3(3) states that, "subject to section HP 1(2) and any regulations made under section 226G", the GloBE rules are "treated as applying at a time \[ ... \] consistently with \[the most recent Commentary and Guidance\]". It is uncertain what is meant by the inclusion of "treated as" and "at a time" and why the provision is phrased in this way rather than just saying "apply". Section HP 3(3) should be reworded to state more clearly that the GloBE rules apply consistently with the most recent Commentary and Guidance. The phrases “treated as” and “at a time” should be removed because they create ambiguity. b. There is no regulation-making power (RMP) that implements the Commentary and Guidance themselves (as external materials) and provides for the implementation of changes to them. New section 226G provides for regulations to disapply changes to the Commentary and Guidance. Section HP 3(3) seeks to apply the Commentary and Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 30 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Guidance; however, this provision does not sit easily alongside the RMP in section HP 4 to implement the GloBE rules themselves. Without coordinated RMPs implementing the Commentary and GloBE rules, there is a risk that the Commentary and GloBE rules themselves could become out of sync. Further, it is not made explicit in section HP 3(3) that the "most recent" versions of the Commentary and Guidance, as a default position, would include any changes to that Commentary and Guidance that have been made subsequent to the implementation date of the GloBE rules themselves, which is set by RMP in section HP 4. The fact that section HP 3(3) is subject to section HP 1(2) (which deals with implementation dates set by Order in Council under section HP (4)) may create this impression, but this could be made more transparent. Sections HP 3 and HP 4 should be amended to provide for the implementation of Commentary and Guidance materials themselves, and to provide for the implementation of changes to Commentary and Guidance, to avoid ambiguity as to how and when changes to these materials are to apply in New Zealand. Comment a. Officials are proposing to change the wording “at a time” to “for a fiscal year”, for clarity. Officials also agree that removing the words “treated as” may reduce ambiguity. b. Given that, under the Bill as drafted, there is automatic flow-through of changes to the Model Rules as well as to Commentary and Guidance, officials do not agree that there is a risk of the Commentary and GloBE rules becoming out of sync. The Bill does not require secondary legislation to be made to implement Commentary or Guidance, or changes to them. This reflects the policy intent that amendments to the Commentary and Agreed Administrative Guidance be incorporated automatically into New Zealand’s law. Section HP 3 refers to the most recent Commentary and Guidance published by the OECD before the start of the relevant fiscal year. Given that the OECD may either amend or replace its Commentary or Guidance, keeping the reference ambulatory avoids the need to refer to a particular document, which may end up being replaced during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. Officials consider it is clear enough that the “most recent” version published before the start of the relevant fiscal year may have been published after the commencement of the section, and that an attempt to make this more explicit would introduce unnecessary wordiness to the legislation. Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 31 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 44 Issue: Criterion for exercising Order in Council power Submission (New Zealand Law Society) If New Zealand proposes to only implement the rules in the event a critical mass of other countries also does so, then that criterion should be reflected in the power allowing the Government to select the implementation date. This would provide a standard against which a New Zealand court may test the Government’s exercise of its power under section HP 4 of the ITA. Comment As noted in comments on other application date-related submissions, officials are now proposing to set fixed effective dates for the GloBE rules, and these effective dates, if agreed to, would replace the Order in Council power. However, a rationale for the formulation of the Order in Council power is set out below. The originally proposed Order in Council power sets an earliest potential implementation date of 1 January 2024. The purpose of the power is to give the Government the flexibility to make a judgement-based decision on the appropriate implementation date subject to this limitation. The intention is that the Government will implement the rules if a critical mass of other countries also implements them. The Government may consider a range of supporting factors when determining whether a critical mass of countries will implement. It is not intended that the implementation of the rules, if and when decided on, should be subject to review. Section 185T of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 contains an Order in Council power for setting the implementation date for the extended model reporting standard for digital platforms with no statutorily- prescribed criteria. This provides a precedent for the approach proposed in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting officials’ first comment. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 32 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 44 Issue: Recommendation to exercise Order in Council power Submission (Cantin Consulting, KPMG) The implementing Order in Council should be made on the recommendation of the Ministers of Revenue, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Trade and Export Growth, and should take into account not only whether there is a critical mass but also whether implementation is supported by New Zealand’s economic and trade interests, including the risk of a trade response from the United States. Comment An Order in Council is an order made by the Governor-General in Council, which means the Governor-General acting on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council, which comprises all Ministers of the Crown including the Ministers of Revenue, Finance, Foreign Affairs, and Trade and Export Growth. Therefore, it is not necessary to name a specific Minister to recommend the making of the Order in Council. Although proposed section HP 4(1)(c) of the ITA only mentions the Minister of Revenue, the purpose of this provision is to give the Minister of Revenue the power to initiate the process through their recommendation. As noted in other comments, however, officials are now proposing to set fixed effective dates for the GloBE rules, and these effective dates, if agreed to, would replace the Order in Council power. Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting officials’ final comment. Clauses 44 and 69 Issue: Coordination between regulation-making powers Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) a. Clause 44 would provide for the implementation of the GloBE rules by inserting new subpart HP into the ITA. The Bill would also insert a number of provisions relating to the GloBE rules, such as the information disclosure and reporting requirements in new sections 78H, 781 and 78J (clause 69), into the TAA. The current design of regulation- Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 33 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] making powers in the Bill would provide that these provisions come into force by different Orders in Council. For some of these provisions, text is included in the Bill to account for coordination between potential different implementation dates (see clause 69(2)). However, while this text is included in the Bill itself in these cases, it is not included in the text of amendments that would be inserted into the TAA. While tax legislation has different drafting conventions, it is unclear why this design choice has been made. b. Additionally, there is no coordination mechanism between the making of the Order in Council, which would provide for the commencement of section 78H (clause 69), and the Order in Council that would implement the GloBE rules. New section 78H relates to subject matter contained in the GloBE rules, which, as external materials, would not take effect in New Zealand before implemented through secondary legislation (through regulation-making powers contained in new section HP 4 of the ITA). Therefore, it is unclear how new section 78H could take effect without being coordinated with the implementation of the GloBE rules. Comment a. Clause 69(2) of the Bill is an application provision for proposed new sections 78I and 78J of the TAA. Including application provisions for amendments to principal tax Acts in the ‘skeleton’ of the amending Act accords with Inland Revenue’s drafting conventions for tax legislation. This differs from the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s drafting convention for non-tax Acts of including application provisions for amendments to a principal Act in the first schedule of the principal Act. b. The intention was that an order would be made under clause 2 implementing all the clauses referred to in clause 2(22) of the Bill at the same time the Order implementing the first component(s) of the applied GloBE rules was made under proposed new section HP 4 of the ITA. Thus, a coordination between the making of these orders was envisaged. But coordinating them legislatively would add unnecessary complexity to the legislation. However, officials are now recommending that the Bill set fixed effective dates for the various components of the applied global anti-base erosion rules. If this recommendation is accepted by the Committee, both of these regulation-making powers would be deleted from the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 34 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] TAX LIABILITY Clause 44 Issue: Release from joint and several liability Submission (PwC) Additional provisions are needed to allow for the release of a New Zealand entity from joint and several liability when it leaves a particular MNE group. These provisions should be similar to the rules that apply in the context of a company leaving a tax consolidated group and a person leaving a GST group. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 44 Issue: Allocation of multinational top-up tax liability Submission (KPMG) Clarification is required on how a UTPR top-up tax liability for New Zealand is allocated between companies in New Zealand. The proposed rules do not provide any clarity on which company has the prima facie UTPR tax liability (which is determined on a jurisdictional basis) or how this UTPR liability is to be allocated between companies (with associated filing obligations). Comment The Bill proposes that all constituent entities located in New Zealand will be jointly and severally liable for the UTPR top-up tax. It would be up to the New Zealand constituent entities to decide how that tax liability is met. If it is not met, the Government can pursue any of them. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 35 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 51 to 54 Issue: Imputation Submission (OliverShaw Ltd) Companies should have imputation credits for all payments of multinational top-up tax. The reason for not allowing imputation credits is that the credits might be seen as a refund of company tax. However, in New Zealand, almost all individual shareholders entitled to claim imputation credits will be on a tax rate of 30% or more (above 15%) so there is no realistic material likelihood that imputation credits will lead to tax refunds reducing the effective tax rate of income earned through companies below 15%. Comment The Model Rules state that if the payment of tax under a country’s IIR or UTPR gives rise to a benefit, the IIR or UTPR will not be qualifying. In that event, other participating countries will continue to apply GloBE top-up tax to the country’s in-scope MNEs under their UTPR. Generally, New Zealand income tax paid by a New Zealand company gives rise to an imputation credit, which can be passed on to the company’s shareholders when the company pays a dividend. However, if New Zealand’s IIR or UTPR gave rise to an imputation credit, although sufficient tax will be paid at a corporate level under the IIR or UTPR, the entire GloBE top-up tax amount will be available as a dollar-for-dollar tax reduction to the shareholder’s tax liability and the imposition of the IIR or UTPR would be unwound on distribution. The OECD has advised that this benefit would result in an IIR and UTPR being non-qualifying. For this reason, under the proposed rules, GloBE top-up tax payable under the IIR and UTPR does not give rise to imputation credits. This is the same result that would apply if there had been no under-taxation giving rise to imposition of the IIR or UTPR in the first place. In that case there would be foreign tax paid instead of IIR or UTPR. Foreign tax does not give rise to an imputation credit. A payment of tax under a country’s top-up tax rules for domestic income that gives rise to an imputation credit, will not result in the rules being non-qualifying. This is specifically provided for in the GloBE rules and reflects that, while these rules must be based on the GloBE rules, they are a local tax on local profits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 36 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 48 Issue: Foreign tax credits for QDMTT Submission (KPMG) It is arguable that GloBE top-up tax paid under a QDMTT is of substantially the same nature as multinational top-up tax given a QDMTT must (by definition per the Model Rules) determine excess profits in a manner that is equivalent to the GloBE rules. Legislative clarification is required to confirm that GloBE top-up tax paid under a QDMTT is in fact included within the meaning of foreign income tax and therefore a foreign tax credit is available. Comment The Bill currently excludes from the definition of “foreign income tax” an amount of tax of substantially the same nature as multinational top-up tax, which is defined in the Bill as tax payable under the proposed subpart HP of the ITA. This subpart includes the proposed domestic income inclusion rule, which is substantially the same in nature as a QDMTT, so it is arguable that there would not be a foreign tax credit for GloBE top-up tax paid under a QDMTT. However, a foreign tax credit should be available for top-up tax paid under a QDMTT, so officials agree the legislation should be clarified to this effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 37 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] COMPLIANCE COSTS Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Compliance costs Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd, Patterson Legal, PwC, Russell McVeagh) The proposed GloBE tax rules will affect very few New Zealand taxpayers. Yet the rules are complex and will impose high compliance costs on taxpayers that are in scope or have the potential to be in scope. a. To alleviate the burden, compliance with the rules and the information return for New Zealand businesses should be made as simple as possible. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) b. The legislation should include enough details such that taxpayers can determine whether they are in scope of the proposed GloBE rules without needing to access and understand the OECD documentation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) c. Inland Revenue should also maintain and publish a list of countries where there is an obligation to exchange information. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) d. New Zealand officials should support in-scope taxpayers by publishing guidance or working with them to work out how the GloBE rules should be applied in a New Zealand context. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) e. There is a critical need to ensure sufficient resourcing within Inland Revenue to support in-scope MNEs to comply with the new rules. (EY) Comment a. Officials agree that the GloBE rules and information return should be made as easy to comply with as possible to reduce the compliance burden. This is an ongoing workstream at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework. b. The purpose of including the GloBE rules by reference is to incorporate those rules efficiently and effectively within New Zealand legislation. These seemingly simple rules contain wording with complex definitions. It would not be possible to include the scoping criteria or to add a purpose provision without inadvertently over-simplifying those rules, and repeating the Model Rules and Commentary would defeat the purpose of the inclusion by reference approach. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 38 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] c. The exact details required in the GloBE information returns, as well as the exchange of information in relation to these returns, are still being worked out. Depending on the outcome of this work, there could be merit in publishing a list of countries where there is an obligation on New Zealand to exchange information. d. Officials agree that assistance should be provided as necessary in the appropriate form to promote compliance. e. Officials agree that Inland Revenue should be resourced adequately to assist in-scope MNEs in New Zealand with complying with the proposed rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted, except for the submission in paragraph (b), which should be declined. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Website accessibility of OECD referred documents Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd) OECD documents that are incorporated into legislation by reference should be made accessible to the New Zealand public on a New Zealand Government website(s). These documents should be made accessible on the New Zealand legislation website, both electronically and available for purchase. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that the OECD documents incorporated into legislation by reference should be accessible to the New Zealand public. Consistent with other OECD documents incorporated by reference (such as transfer pricing, where the OECD transfer pricing guidelines are incorporated by reference), officials consider that this is best achieved by including a hyperlink on the Inland Revenue website to the OECD documents, which are located on the OECD website; and note that no legislative provisions are required to implement this. The documents are available to view and download, free of charge by any person, on the OECD website. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 39 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Accounting standards Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Inland Revenue commentary should make it clear that the IIR and DIIR can be calculated using either the ultimate parent’s or the New Zealand parent’s accounting standards to reduce compliance costs. Comment Article 3.1.3 of the Model Rules and related Commentary contain rules for when an accounting standard other than the ultimate parent’s accounting standard may be used to determine the financial accounting net income or loss for a constituent entity. Under Article 3.1.3, another accounting standard may be used if it is not reasonably practical to use the parent’s accounting standard and certain other requirements are met. The Commentary states that this rule is not expected to apply in many cases because an MNE will typically have mechanisms in place to convert a subsidiary’s entity-level accounts to the ultimate parent’s accounting standard for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements. However, the rule could apply, for example, when an MNE has undertaken a recent acquisition of a group of entities that have historically used a different accounting standard to that of the acquiring MNE, and it is not reasonably practicable for the MNE to convert the acquired entities’ financial accounting systems from their historical financial accounting standard to the ultimate parent’s standard. Therefore, where the financial accounting net income or loss for an entity is calculated under the ultimate parent’s accounting standard, the Model Rules, and Commentary require that calculation to be used. New Zealand’s rules on the use of accounting standards must align with the Model Rules and Commentary to be qualifying. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: New Zealand safe harbours and exemptions Submission (OliverShaw Ltd, Russell McVeagh) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 40 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] New Zealand has few MNEs in scope and because of our robust domestic tax laws the GloBE rules are unlikely to have a material impact on New Zealand. Notwithstanding this, the rules will result in a material compliance cost for some MNEs. New Zealand should consider and provide a range of exemptions and safe harbours to reduce compliance costs. Comment The GloBE rules operate on a “common approach” basis such that our rules need to be “qualifying” to stop another country’s GloBE rules applying to our MNEs. This means there is no scope for New Zealand to introduce safe harbours specific to New Zealand. Consequently, to ensure safe harbours are as effective as possible, multilateral solutions should be developed. In this respect it should be noted that the OECD released the second iteration of Agreed Administrative Guidance on the GloBE rules, which includes a permanent QDMTT safe harbour and a transitional UTPR safe harbour. 1 Officials are confident these will go a long way to ensuring that the compliance burden on MNEs, including New Zealand MNEs, is minimised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Qualified domestic minimum top-up tax Submission (Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, Philip Coghini, PwC) The Bill proposes that New Zealand MNEs be subject to a domestic IIR, such that they would have to pay top up tax if their mobile New Zealand profits are low taxed. Submissions supported New Zealand implementing a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax (QDMTT) applying to all in-scope MNEs with operations in New Zealand, rather than the more limited DIIR. Given the differences between the DIIR and the QDMTT, it should be stress-tested with the OECD that the DIIR is considered to be “qualifying”. Separately, it needs to be ensured that the DIIR does not breach any of New Zealand’s international trade and investment agreements. (PwC) It would be more appropriate for the New Zealand government to collect tax on New Zealand low-taxed income, rather than another jurisdiction, even if the additional tax 1 OECD (2022), Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief: Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (Pillar Two), OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, OECD, Paris. www.oecd.org/tax/beps/safe-harbours-and-penalty-relief- global-anti-base-erosion-rules-pillar-two.pdf Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 41 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] collected may not be significant. Because the tax will otherwise be imposed in another jurisdiction, a QDMTT can be imposed with no impact on foreign direct investment. (Cantin Consulting, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) A QDMTT is not substantially different to the DIIR, so it should not materially increase compliance costs for MNEs. (Cantin Consulting, EY) Inland Revenue’s administration costs in confirming whether a QDMTT applies, and audit costs, can be minimised through leveraging existing features of the tax system and taking a targeted approach to assessing risk. (Cantin Consulting) Other countries, such as Australia, have indicated they will be implementing a full QDMTT. The DIIR will therefore create disparity between countries, resulting in uncertainty for in- scope MNEs and complexity in the administration of the rules. Further, the disparity may create opportunities for tax arbitrage, international tax planning, and other unintended consequences. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY) Should the adoption of the DIIR proceed, it will be essential for Inland Revenue to provide clear guidance on the key differences between the DIIR and a QDMTT; and undertake an education campaign on these differences targeting in-scope MNEs and other tax authorities. (EY) Comment The New Zealand DIIR proposed in the Bill is based on the Model Rules. Preliminary engagement with the OECD Secretariat indicates that the proposed rules will be qualifying. Officials expect this to be formally confirmed as part of the OECD qualification process. Officials note that the resources Inland Revenue would have to apply to police the multinationals within scope of the proposed DIIR is significantly lower than the resources that would have to be applied to police the multinationals within scope of a QDMTT. This is because the proposed DIIR only applies to multinationals headquartered in New Zealand whereas a QDMTT applies to all multinationals in scope of the GloBE rules. Officials are looking to adopt the GloBE rules in a way that makes compliance easier for MNEs in New Zealand, including those headquartered overseas. Compliance will be easier for New Zealand multinationals if they only have to report to Inland Revenue. Compliance will be easier for foreign multinationals if they report and pay top-up tax to their own headquarter’s country, and not also to New Zealand. Officials agree that guidance should be provided on New Zealand-specific aspects of the proposed GloBE rules to assist with compliance. Recommendation That the submissions supporting adoption of a QDMTT in New Zealand be declined, and the other submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 42 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION Clauses 44, 63, 68 and 69 Issue: Exchange of information safeguards Submission (Russell McVeagh) The GloBE rules provide that the GloBE Information Return will be shared with other jurisdictions under agreements for the automatic exchange of tax information. New Zealand should ensure that the models developed for exchange of information incorporate rigorous safeguards against the disclosure of confidential and extremely sensitive commercial information so that New Zealand MNEs subject to the rules are not in any way commercially compromised or undermined. Comment The automatic exchange of tax information is not unique to the GloBE rules. Mechanisms for sharing tax information between tax authorities have been in place for some time and are used extensively. This includes bilaterally through double tax agreements and multilaterally through the OECD’s Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. 2 Robust safeguards to protect commercially sensitive information are a fundamental pillar of tax information exchange agreements and the terms of such agreements are drafted with this firmly in mind. The safeguards are also rigorously monitored by tax authorities. Upon signing up to the convention, over 60 jurisdictions agreed to adhere to its requirements, which are also monitored by the OECD through a periodic peer review process. The mechanism for the automatic exchange of tax information in relation to the GloBE rules has not yet been fully developed. In the GloBE Information Return report, published by the OECD in July 2023 3 , the OECD Inclusive Framework noted that the mechanism would follow that used in current models, saying: ... bilateral and multilateral models for the Qualifying Competent Authority Agreement will be developed and would be based on the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, a Tax Information Exchange Agreement, a Tax Treaty with a provision equivalent to Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax Convention or any other international agreement that allows automatic exchange of information. 2 The Convention used for the exchange of tax information under the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard and Country-by-Country Reporting. 3 OECD (2023), Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – GloBE Information Return (Pillar Two), July 2023, available at www.oecd.org Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 43 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 44 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PRIVACY Clauses 68 and 69 Issue: Consultation with Privacy Commissioner Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) It is not clear whether the Privacy Commissioner or the Inland Revenue Privacy Officer were consulted on the information-requiring provisions in clauses 68 and 69. The Privacy Commissioner has a statutory function to examine proposed legislation that provides for the collection of personal information by public sector agencies. If a Bill raises privacy issues, it is standard practice for the Privacy Commissioner to be consulted. Consequently, the Committee may like to ask officials whether the Privacy Commissioner or the Inland Revenue Privacy Officer were consulted on clauses 68 and 69, and if not, why not. Comment In relation to clause 68, the clause does not require any additional information – only that the information be provided in a prescribed electronic form. In relation to clause 69, the information required to be provided is information the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would already be entitled to ask for. The reporting obligations being placed on such MNEs in this case are similar to those they already face in relation to other taxes, except that more information is required regarding their non-New Zealand operations. The Privacy Commissioner was not consulted because there did not seem to be any reason for such consultation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 45 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PENALTIES Clauses 74 and 75 Issue: Penalties for filing late or incomplete return or for late registration Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, EY, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) A proposed penalty of up to $100,000 for filing a GloBE Information Return (GIR) late or incomplete is punitive and inconsistent with other penalties in the TAA, and should be reduced. In particular, imposing a penalty of this size for late registration (later than six months after the end of the first fiscal year that a New Zealand constituent entity is a member of a group that comes within the proposed rules) seems unnecessarily punitive. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) If a reduction in the amount of the penalty renders it non-compliant with the GloBE rules, the penalty should be limited to foreign-headquartered MNEs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The penalty should not apply to an incomplete return. The return will be filed electronically so there is little scope for omission. If the error is deliberate, there are other ways to address this within the tax system. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) New Zealand taxpayers should not be penalised in relation to tax filings made outside New Zealand or by other group members, such as a late and/or incomplete return by the ultimate parent entity or in a country with which New Zealand does not have an exchange of information agreement. (PwC) Other suggestions submitted are:  Inland Revenue contacting taxpayers directly if a submission is completed late because very few taxpayers are impacted by the regime. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group)  Taxpayers being notified and given an ability to respond before a penalty is imposed. (The submission noted this would not require a change to the proposed legislation and could be reflected in guidance instead.) (PwC)  A grace period in the initial years as impacted MNEs get up to speed with the rules. (The submission noted this would not need a change to the proposed legislation and could be reflected in guidance instead.) (PwC)  The penalty only applying in exceptional circumstances. (KPMG) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 46 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Concern was expressed about the discretionary nature of the penalty because the penalty, up to $100,000, could be disproportionate to the offence. Guidance on how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s discretion is to be applied should be legislated or otherwise provided to provide certainty for taxpayers. (EY, KPMG) Comment The Model Rules do not stipulate what penalties should be imposed, or the amount, in the event of non-compliance. However, the penalty needs to be sufficiently large to be effective in deterring non-compliance. The target of the penalty is MNEs with annual global revenue over €750 million. Officials note that section 139AB of the TAA already provides for the Commissioner to impose a penalty of up to $100,000 on members of large multinationals that fail to provide certain required information within the allowed time window. Moreover, as the GloBE rules are intended to be a multilateral solution, regard must also be given to the size of the penalty relative to what is being proposed in other jurisdictions. Officials note that Australia has proposed penalties between $111,000 and $555,000 for similar non-compliance. It is important that the registration, filing and other requirements of the New Zealand GloBE rules are complied with. The Bill proposes that a New Zealand taxpayer will have filing obligations if a foreign member of the group has not filed the required information on time in their own home country. This means it is appropriate that the New Zealand constituent entity is subject to the proposed penalty regime if they fail to comply. This is in line with the Model Rules. Officials note that the Bill allows exculpatory factors to be taken into account by allowing the amount of the penalty to be discretionary. As recognised by some submitters, existing rules allow the Commissioner discretion to contact and work with the taxpayer before a penalty is imposed, and to state in advance what factors will be relevant in determining the level of penalty. Officials acknowledge those submissions that have brought up concerns over the discretionary nature of the amount of the penalty. However, the Commissioner already has discretion in relation to other penalties. Officials note that the GloBE rules will be administered by a specialised team within Inland Revenue to ensure the rules are administered in a principled and consistent manner. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 47 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 75 Issue: Disparity in penalty rates Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) Clause 75 would insert new section 139ABB into the TAA and impose the following penalties for MNEs:  a civil penalty of up to $100,000 for failure to register for GloBE or fulfil reporting requirements as required under new section 78H, 78I or 78J  a civil penalty of $500 for failure to provide a return for a fiscal year as required under new section 78J. These provisions are standard within a tax context and the penalty amount of up to $100,000 is in line with similar penalties for non-compliance with information disclosure obligations, such as section 139AB of the TAA. However, the structure of proposed new section 139ABB appears unusual. The carve-out for a lower penalty rate is unusual for penalty provisions and the difference between these two penalty rates ($500 and up to $100,000) seems unusual. Comment Section 139ABB imposes penalties for:  an in-scope MNE group with operations in New Zealand failing to register for GloBE tax  such a group failing to file its pre-assessment GloBE information return in New Zealand if required by the GloBE rules to do so  such a group failing to file a tax return in New Zealand. The first two breaches are subject to a penalty of up to $100,000. This is in line with penalties imposed by Australia, and meets the OECD requirement for such penalties to be sufficient to dissuade non-compliance by these extremely large entities. The third penalty is for a purely domestic tax obligation and is in line with the penalty for failing to file an income tax return. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 48 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Addressing transfer pricing impacts Submission (Philip Coghini) Consideration should be given to addressing the potential for transfer pricing. Comment The Model Rules contain specific rules to address the valuation of cross-border transactions in accordance with the arm’s length principle; the allocation of profit between a permanent establishment (PE) and its head office; and the allocation of the income of a tax transparent constituent entity (when not attributable to a PE). These rules all rely on the existing arm’s length concepts. Determination of an arm’s length price is a vast topic in its own right, which it would not make sense to duplicate in the GloBE rules. Officials consider that this approach is sufficient to address the transfer pricing considerations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 68 and 69 Issue: Public disclosure of country-by-country reports Submission (Tax Justice Aotearoa) Country-by-country reports should be made publicly available on a similar basis to that recently proposed by the Australian Government. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but note that it would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Whether country-by-country reports should be made publicly available is a matter better dealt with at the OECD. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 49 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Beneficial ownership tax register Submission (Philip Coghini) One submitter suggested that the GloBE rules should recommend the implementation of a beneficial ownership tax register since they impact on double tax agreements and reducing offshore income and profits. Comment Officials acknowledge the matter raised in this submission but do not believe that the GloBE rules are the appropriate place to deal with it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Exemption from GloBE rules for iwi organisations Submission (Philip Coghini) One submitter asked whether Iwi organisations can qualify as organisations exempt from the GloBE rules. Comment Officials acknowledge that because Māori authorities are taxed at a lower statutory tax rate than ordinary companies this could potentially expose them to a GloBE tax liability. However:  The rate is still above the GloBE rate of 15%.  The scoping criteria of €750 million revenue in at least two of the four fiscal years immediately preceding the test year and an international presence would not bring any Māori organisations in scope. In addition, because it is not a one-year test, should a Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 50 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Māori organisation reach this threshold there is ample time for officials to approach the OECD Inclusive Framework to consider the inclusion of Māori authorities on the excluded entity list. Recommendation That the submission be declined, noting officials’ comment above. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Impact on foreign direct investment and export/import trade Submission (Philip Coghini) Consideration should be given to whether the GloBE rules benefit foreign direct investment in New Zealand and improve export/import trade, or whether the rules benefit outward direct investment and import (and/or re-exports) trade. Comment It is intended that the GloBE rules would only be adopted when a critical mass of other jurisdictions have adopted the rules as well. This means that the adoption of the GloBE rules in New Zealand should not impact international trade or foreign direct investment because GloBE tax liability would be incurred regardless of whether New Zealand adopts the rules or not. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clauses 44 and 63 Issue: Inland Revenue should be able to provide binding rulings on the applied GloBE rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Inland Revenue should be able to provide binding rulings (under Part 5A of the TAA) in relation to the application of the applied GloBE rules, including the Model Rules and Agreed Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 51 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Administrative Guidance, in the same way as it provides binding rulings on other tax laws. It is not clear from existing section 91C of the TAA that it is entitled to do so. We note that section 91C explicitly gives the Commissioner the power to make binding rulings in relation to Orders in Council and regulations made under the TAA. Adding an explicit reference to the applied GloBE rules would remove uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clauses 74 and 75 Issue: Empowering assessment provisions for discretionary penalties Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error has been identified where two proposed discretionary penalties in the TAA do not have corresponding assessment provisions that would empower the Commissioner to make an assessment of the penalties. These penalties are for:  persons who do not meet the country-by-country reporting requirements (as included in the Bill in proposed section 139AAB), and  those associated with the applied global anti-base erosion rules (as included in the Bill proposed section 139ABB). In addition to the penalties proposed in the Bill, two other existing penalties have been identified as not having a corresponding assessment provision. These penalties are for:  members of large multinational groups that do not provide information required of them by the Commissioner (section 139AB), and  trustees of foreign exemption trusts who do not register with, or provide information to, the Commissioner, when required (section 139AC). All these penalties have been modelled on existing penalties in the TAA that have empowering assessment provisions. These are penalties the Commissioner can assess in relation to the Common Reporting Standard and the Digital Platform Information reporting requirements. Officials recommend adding empowering assessment provisions for the above penalties to ensure there is no doubt that the Commissioner can assess them if the relevant statutory requirements are met. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 52 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Officials also recommend that the Commissioner is not required to issue a notice of proposed adjustment before making an assessment of the above penalties. This is also consistent with the rules that exist for penalties related to the Common Reporting Standard and Digital Platform Information reporting requirements. The proposal is mechanical in nature and merely clarifies the clearly understood policy intent, so the amendments should take effect from the date after the Bill receives the Royal assent, except for the penalty related to the applied global anti-base erosion rules, which should take effect on and from 1 January 2025. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 53 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] TAXATION (ANNUAL RATES FOR 2023–24, MULTINATIONAL TAX, AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) BILL Trustee tax rate Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 55 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OVERVIEW The Bill proposes to increase the trustee tax rate to 39% from 1 April 2024. The current 33% trustee tax rate means that individuals that earn tax-paid trustee income from a trust are not subject to the 39% personal tax rate on such distributions, even if they earn over $180,000 in personal income and distributed tax-paid trustee income. This undermines the fairness of the tax system. To buttress the proposed 39% trustee tax rate, the Bill includes a proposal to tax certain beneficiary income allocations at this rate. This would ensure that companies cannot be used to shelter income from the trustee tax rate. This proposal is targeted towards family trusts and would not affect the commercial use of trusts in large corporate groups. While addressing the current under-taxation of trust income, it is also important as far as possible to mitigate any over-taxation. This arises when trustee income is taxed at a rate higher than the personal tax rates of the beneficiaries and settlors of the trust. The risk of over-taxation can currently be mitigated in many situations by the ability of trustees to allocate income to beneficiaries (taxed at the personal tax rate of the beneficiary). However, there are situations where income cannot be allocated to beneficiaries. The Bill contains proposals to further help mitigate the risk of over-taxation of deceased estates and trusts settled for the care of disabled people (disabled beneficiary trusts). Due to Budget sensitivity, we were unable to undertake public consultation during the development of the proposals. However, since Budget, we have undertaken consultation with a large number of stakeholders. Feedback from most stakeholders focused on the risk of over-taxation of trust income. Submissions on the trustee tax rate proposals in the Bill can be summarised into the following categories:  support for the proposals  opposition to the proposals and, in particular, the process followed and approach taken to addressing the under-taxation of trustee income  feedback on the timing of the proposals and, in particular, that they should be deferred  concerns about the problem definition and supporting evidence  concerns about the impact of the proposals, including behavioural responses by trustees, the over-taxation of trustee income and the over-taxation of specific types of trusts  suggestions for alternative approaches to the problem  feedback on the proposed design of the disabled beneficiary trusts and deceased estates modifications Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 56 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  opposition to, and feedback on, the proposed corporate beneficiary rule, and  the relevance of the trust disclosure rules in the context of a 39% trustee tax rate. Officials are recommending changes to the proposals based on feedback from targeted consultation and written submissions. These recommendations can be summarised as the following:  Introducing a $10,000 trustee income de minimis to further reduce the risk of over- taxation under a 39% trustee rate.  Amendments simplifying and expanding the application of modifications for deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts proposed in the Bill, including: o Taxing eligible deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts at 33%. o Extending the deceased estates modification to cover the year of death and the following full three income years. o Allowing a disabled beneficiary trust to have multiple disabled beneficiaries.  Excluding energy consumer trusts and legacy superannuation funds from the 39% trustee tax rate because these trusts have limited ability to mitigate over-taxation.  Minor technical amendments. Submissions on the trustee tax rate proposals, and officials’ responses, are discussed below.

(New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Patterson Legal)  Inland Revenue data shows that when the trustee tax rate has been lower than the top income tax rate, significant amounts of income have been diverted into trusts to take advantage of the lower tax rate. This is not conducive to a fair and progressive tax system and undermines the Government’s ability to raise revenue. (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions)  This is an orthodox approach and was recommended by the Tax Review 2001 and has been recommended in other reviews since that time. (Patterson Legal) Acknowledgement of the rationale for increasing the trustee rate from 33% to 39%. (KPMG, NZ Shareholders’ Association, PwC, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd)  The proposal to increase the trustee rate is a logical adjunct to the increase in the top personal tax rate. However, it is crucial to ensure that the increased trustee tax rate does not result in over-taxation of trusts with lower-rate beneficiaries. (EY)  This is consistent with the goal of maintaining the integrity of the tax system. However, it may significantly increase the compliance costs for trustees of trusts with minimal income. (Baucher Consulting Ltd)  The previous Government’s concerns about potential under-taxation due to tax rate misalignment and the merit in addressing this from a tax policy perspective is understandable. (PwC)  The previous Government’s intention to align the trustee and top personal tax rates is respectable. (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 58 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Timing of proposals Submission (A Harmos, C Macalister, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd, Taxpayers’ Union) The application date of the proposed 39% trustee rate should be deferred.  The proposals require more time and consideration. The current approach will give rise to adverse and unintended consequences. (A Harmos, PwC)  This would allow time to analyse trust disclosure information collected for the 2021–22 income year and to develop appropriate rules. In the absence of additional data and analysis, the proposal to increase the trustee rate is premature. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) o If deferral is not possible, an application date of 1 April 2025 is recommended.  The change should at least be deferred until a proper consultation process has been carried out. This should minimise the chances of hasty policy development being translated into legislation that inappropriately impacts some (or many) taxpayers. (Taxpayers’ Union) o This may be a major change for the 400,000 trusts registered in New Zealand. o Inland Revenue has proposed special arrangements in certain cases, but there may be arrangements it has not considered or is not aware of.  The proposals should not proceed in this Bill if a better approach to bolstering the 39% tax rate cannot be found in the given time frame. (C Macalister)  The principle that “tax should be paid at the personal tax rate of the economic owner” should be considered and subject to GTPP. The decision on whether this should be a principle of New Zealand’s tax system should be made explicit. The proposals should be deferred until this is settled. (Cantin Consulting)  The proposals should be withdrawn until: o The “tax at personal rate” principle and the reasons why it is not always applied have been considered, the result of that consideration has been subject to GTPP, and a decided policy is made explicit. o Other solutions have been considered according to the GTPP. For more information, see Issue: Generic Tax Policy Process and Issue: Further consultation required.

Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 60 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PROBLEM DEFINITION Issue: Concerns with problem definition Submission (A Harmos, C Macalister, Cantin Consulting, Deloitte, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Submitters consider that the problem definition has been poorly defined.  The terminology used in the proposals misdescribes the problem: o The stated problem is that trusts are used to “avoid” the 39% tax rate. “Avoid” should not be used to describe a design feature of the trust rules. o Trusts are described as “circumventing” the 39% tax rate, which presumes that the 39% rate should apply when there is no discernible policy that it should. o The term “misalignment” presumes an issue with income not being taxed at personal tax rates. This is not a discernible principle in the tax system. (Cantin Consulting)  We should not assume that the income arising from capital invested through the trust would unlikely arise to the settlors in the absence of the trust rules. (C Macalister)  The proposals seem to be a fundraising measure rather than a tax base buttressing measure. (A Harmos, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd)  Current legislation already contains rules that ensure the tax treatment should mirror the economic outcome and the recent personal tax rate change, along with the trust disclosure rules (despite being an overreach), have gone a long way to ensure that the tax treatment reflects economic reality. (Deloitte)  The trustee rate proposals and their real intent have been deliberately misrepresented by the Government, Inland Revenue and the Treasury to the New Zealand public. (A Harmos) o The foundation of the proposals is the false characterisation of unrealised revaluation gains as income in the Inland Revenue report as Minister Parker has ordained. o The actual intent and effect of the legislation is to broaden the tax net by treating trustees of a trust as 39% taxpayers, not closing a loophole where 39% taxpayers can receive tax-paid trustee income that has been taxed at a lower rate. Comment The current 33% trustee tax rate is a final tax. This means that subsequent distributions of tax-paid trustee income are not subject to the 39% personal tax rate on those distributions, even if they earn over $180,000 in personal income and distributed trustee income. This Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 61 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] undermines the fairness of the tax system because an individual that earns more than $180,000 in personal income and distributed trustee income is subject to less tax than an individual that earns more than $180,000 from personal income alone. This is the “under- taxation” of trust income. Officials agree that the terms “avoid” and “circumvent” are unhelpful when describing the problem of under-taxation. This outcome is a result of tax policy settings and is not, in and of itself, a result of taxpayers “avoiding” or “circumventing” the 39% personal tax rate. We acknowledge that “misalignment” presupposes that there is a problem with having different tax rates across the tax system. A more neutral description could be that the tax system has “non-aligned” or “unaligned” tax rates. Conversely, “over-taxation” occurs when trustee income is taxed at a rate higher than the personal tax rates of the beneficiaries and settlors of the trust. Over-taxation is an existing issue with the 33% trustee tax rate that will be exacerbated by increasing the rate to 39%. Since the introduction of the current trust tax regime in 1988, the trustee tax rate has been 33%. This rate was chosen intentionally to achieve alignment with the top personal tax rate, and it has only fallen out of alignment during the two periods since 2000 when the top personal tax rate was 39%. In addition to addressing the under-taxation of trust income while minimising over-taxation where possible, one of the objectives of the proposals was to raise revenue for Budget 2023. HWI research project Data from Inland Revenue’s HWI research project, or any conclusions from that project, did not inform policy development of the trustee tax rate proposals. The trustee tax rate proposals were considered by Cabinet before the HWI research project was published. The proposals were developed to address the under-taxation of trust income, while mitigating as far as possible any over-taxation. The proposals also had the objective of raising revenue for Budget 2023 – there was no link with the HWI research project. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Evidence supporting the problem Submission (ATAINZ, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, OliverShaw Ltd, Perpetual Guardian) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 62 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submitters consider that there is a lack of evidence to support the problem definition and/or proposals:  Despite Cabinet in 2020 deferring a decision on an increase in the trustee rate “to a later date pending information on whether there is a behavioural response to avoid paying the new \[39%\] personal income tax rate”, the increased rate is now being proposed before such information is available. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw Ltd)  There is no information about the amount of non-taxable distributions made to persons with a marginal tax rate of 39%. This information is essential to establish the extent to which, if at all, taxpayers are using trusts to circumvent the top personal tax rate of 39%. In the absence of additional data and analysis, the proposal to increase the trustee tax rate is premature. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  There has been no evidence of the quantum of trusts that are believed to be circumventing the 39% marginal tax rate. Any such examples are in the considerable minority. (Perpetual Guardian)  There are an unknown number of trusts, and many have minimal or no income. According to Inland Revenue statistics, 250,000 trusts filed trust tax returns for the 2021 tax year and 72,500 of those (just over 29%) reported nil income or a loss. No breakdown is presently publicly available of the income bands of those trusts that reported positive income. (ATAINZ)  The Government seems to believe trusts are being used to shelter income that could otherwise be taxed at 39%, companies having income allocated but never paid, and individual beneficiaries receiving the benefit of income that is taxed at the trustee level. These beliefs are misguided, and the trust regime is being used as intended and does not result in wholesale tax avoidance. (Deloitte)  The public evidence does not support the conclusion that the 33% trustee rate means the 39% rate does not apply or that trustee income results in under-taxation. A smaller population of trusts have the 39% problem, but the evidence does not disclose where exactly the problem is. (Cantin Consulting) o To obtain an indication of the possible size of the issue, Inland Revenue could estimate the amount of trustee income not subject to the 39% rate of a beneficiary by attributing trustee income to beneficiaries in proportion to their beneficiary income. Given the trust disclosures made for the 2022 year, this process could be modified by attributing trustee income based on the total taxable and non-taxable distributions. o A 39% rate for all trustee income is not a fair solution. Inland Revenue’s publication of trust disclosure insights 4 from the 2022 tax year shows that the 4 Page 20, https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/revenue-refunds/trusts-and-estates- statistics/trust-disclosure-information-from-the-2022-tax-year Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 63 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] majority of non-taxable distributions disclosed are distributions of trust capital (tax-paid prior year trustee income and realised capital gains).  It appears that roughly $2.3 billion in trust capital was distributed to beneficiaries on $70,000 or less. Assuming all the distributions are from tax-paid income, the overpayment of tax at a 39% rate for these taxpayers will be more than the tax on the $800 million trust capital distributed to taxpayers earning $500,000 personal income.  The report discloses $5 billion of non-taxable distributions to taxpayers earning over $180,000 personal income. This would likely outweigh the over-taxation of taxpayers earning less than $70,000, but it may not outweigh the over-taxation of those earning less than $180,000.  The report does not disclose how much income was finally taxed at 28% due to the PIE tax rules. The PIE rules create an 11% differential from the 39% rate and officials have speculated that investments via PIEs may be a reaction to a 39% rate. The trend of PIE income and PIE investments should be considered. Submitters also commented on increases in trustee income in the 2021 income year or the early 2000s:  We acknowledge that the level of trustee income increased in the 2021 income year. This is a result of companies paying out their accumulated retained earnings as dividends prior to the increase in the personal income tax rate to 39%. As in the 2000 income year (prior to the introduction of a 39% personal rate in 2001) we expect this increase in trustee income to be a one-off occurrence. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Increases in trustee income do not of themselves provide evidence that a rate higher than the trustee rate would have applied in the absence of a trust. (Cantin Consulting) o Conclusions regarding the extent of the problem cannot be extrapolated from the early 2000s because, at the time, the 39% personal tax rate applied to a greater proportion of the population (due to applying at a lower threshold than currently). o The early 2000s’ reorganisation of many SMEs as companies owned by family trusts may indicate a problem with the 39% rate threshold rather than the rate. It also suggests that the company tax rate is the issue. o Companies retained income at the company tax rate rather than trustees retaining income at the trustee rate. There is no evidence of the number of companies or of their income, and therefore whether trust ownership of the companies would mean the 39% does not apply. o The increase in trustee income in 2021 is most likely in anticipation of the 39% personal tax rate. Although the change did not affect the trustee rate, many companies declared and paid dividends to ensure that individual shareholders Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 64 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] did not have the 39% rate applied. Where shareholders included trusts, they would also have derived dividends because dividends cannot be streamed to different shareholders. Comment Income tax return data In the year before the application of the 39% personal tax rate (ie the 2021 tax year), trustee income was significantly higher than previous years. The announcement of the 39% rate during the 2021 tax year, ahead of it applying for the 2022 year, led to companies paying out dividends to individual shareholders and trustees before the new rate came into effect. This ensured that income could be taxed at the (then) 33% top personal tax rate or the 33% trustee tax rate. The increased dividend income derived by trustees in the 2021 tax year is reflected in the dotted blue line on the graph in Figure 1. Figure 1: Income reported by trusts (1994–2022) In the 2022 tax year, dividend income derived by trusts fell by $2.7 billion (down 18.7%). There was a decrease in beneficiary income (down 18.8%) and in trustee income (down 9.8%). As a result of the smaller decline in trustee income, the amount of income taxed at the trustee rate slightly increased. The dashed red line in Figure 1 shows trustee income as a percentage of total income. The amount of income treated as trustee income increased by 10 percentage points in 2021 (before the 39% personal tax rate took effect), and this allocation ratio has been maintained in the 2022 year, despite the decrease in total income. This may illustrate that trustees have made income allocation decisions in response to the 39% personal rate to treat a greater 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 14,000 16,000 18,000 19941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022 % of total income $m Tax year Beneficiary income (left axis) Trustee income (left axis) Dividends (left axis) Trustee income as a % of total income (right axis) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 65 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] proportion of taxable income as trustee income. Despite the change in total income between 2021 and 2022, trustees have maintained this allocation ratio. Behavioural responses to the 39% personal tax rate Increased disclosure requirements for trusts were introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years. Disclosure and tax return data shows that trustees are retaining significantly more income as trustee income following the introduction of the 39% personal tax rate from 1 April 2021. Table 1 below summarises insights based on disclosure and tax return data that shows the behavioural responses of trustees to the introduction of the 39% personal tax rate. Further information can be found on Inland Revenue’s website. 5 Based on the increased percentage of total income being retained as trustee income, and the below insights, we consider that there is strong evidence that trusts provide a tax advantage allowing income to be earned through a trust and not be subject to the 39% personal tax rate. Ta ble 1: 39% insights from trust disclosures Summary Detail Trustees are retaining significantly more income as trustee income For trusts that allocated beneficiary income to an individual earning over $180,000 personal income in the 2020 tax year (prior to the 39% personal tax rate), the amount of income being retained as trustee income has increased from 35% ($590 million) in 2020 to 60% ($840 million) in 2022. Trustees are allocating less beneficiary income to individuals with more than $180,000 personal income The amount of beneficiary income allocated to individuals earning over $180,000 has halved from $900 million in 2020 to $450 million in 2022. Significant settlements have been made on trusts since the 39% personal tax rate was introduced Settlements, reported for the first time in 2022, were significant (over $15 billion) with $4.7 billion settled on trusts settled after the introduction of the 39% personal tax rate.

(ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Macalister, C Wilson, PwC, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society, W Blake)  It is important that the tax system recognises that there are other reasons for using trusts that are not connected to a tax advantage. (Deloitte)  Reasons for the establishment of a trust relationship include: o intergenerational wealth preservation and transfer o wealth generation and accumulation o relationship property protection o asset protection o succession and estate planning o continuity of business o privacy and confidentiality o charitable giving o providing for those who cannot provide for themselves o withholding funds from a relation with addiction issues o protective mechanism for those that have lost mental capacity.

(Corporate Taxpayers Group)  It is not the experience of the submitter that high-income individuals choose to use trusts to circumvent the top 39% personal tax rate. (Perpetual Guardian) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 67 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  As a professional trustee, in exercising our professional and fiduciary responsibilities, a trust cannot be established for the sole purpose of tax minimisation. (Perpetual Guardian)  If people were solely motivated by tax considerations, all family investment would be in companies and subject to tax at 28%. At present, much wealth sits in trusts as opposed to lower tax rate companies because it allows a better mechanism to distribute wealth. (C Macalister)  The trust regime is being used as intended and does not result in wholesale tax avoidance. The proposed changes will fundamentally damage the trust regime and negatively impact the genuine use of trusts. As such, the trustee tax rate should remain at 33%. (Deloitte)  Trustees must comply with the trust deed, trust law and tax law. This means that tax rules will inform their decisions, however care needs to be taken in concluding that having regard to tax is a policy problem. (Cantin Consulting)  When the Law Commission reviewed trust law, it was estimated that there were more than 400,000 trusts in New Zealand. Even assuming that most of the trusts were established in a 39% personal tax rate environment, one can draw from the RIS tables that taxation is not a significant driver of trust establishment for most trusts (by number, rather than income). (Cantin Consulting)  A useful function of trusts will be undermined. Many retain and pay tax on income and apply it to growing the capital of the trust, which itself is applied for the benefit of the economy and community through enabling compounding of reinvested income, which itself is ultimately taxed. (A Harmos) Comment We acknowledge that trusts are settled and used for a wide range of non-tax reasons. Broadly, tax forms one part of the environment that any taxpaying entity operates in. The proposal to increase the trustee tax rate to 39% is intended to address concerns regarding the under-taxation of trust income. Under the current 33% trustee tax rate, under- taxation occurs when an individual derives over $180,000 in personal income and tax-paid trustee income. This occurs regardless of whether the trust was set up for non-tax reasons. The proposals are not solely focused on the use of structures for tax minimisation, but rather are intended to improve the fairness of the tax system by ensuring that individuals do not receive a tax advantage solely by earning income through a trust. The trustee tax rate only applies to income earned by the trust that is not beneficiary income – the underlying assets of the trust are not affected. Therefore, the trustee tax rate will only affect the non-tax purposes of the trust to the extent that the trustees choose not to retain income in the trust. The underlying assets of the trust will not be exposed to relationship property claims or lose asset protection. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 68 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] We are recommending introducing a $10,000 trustee income de minimis. While this would help mitigate the impact of the 39% trustee tax rate for many trusts, we acknowledge that trustees will be required to make trade-offs between mitigating over-taxation by making beneficiary income allocations and retaining income for other reasons.

(Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, G McKinlay, KPMG, Perpetual Guardian, PwC)  This is likely to be the case for most New Zealand trusts. (KPMG)  This is contrary to the rationale of improving the fairness and progressivity of the tax system. The trustee tax rate should therefore be retained at 33%. (Perpetual Guardian)  Trustees of small trusts will pay more tax and have increased accounting fees to cover the increased time spent on their trusts and any distributions to beneficiaries. (C Wilson)  In many cases, trustee income is over-taxed at the current 33% trustee tax rate. However, trustees are comfortable that the tax paid is reasonable given the purposes of the trust and the aim to reduce compliance costs and complexity (as contemplated by section 4 of the Trusts Act 2019). (Deloitte)  Taxing trusts within corporate structures at 39% will give rise to over-taxation. These trusts are not being used to shelter income from the top personal tax rate and it would be inappropriate to tax them as if they were. Accordingly, we do not support the increase in the trustee tax rate in its current form. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  Increasing the trustee tax rate is a crude approach that will tax income from capital and services at the same rate, thus overtaxing income from capital.  In testamentary trusts, funds are held and paid by the trustee when required for the needs of the beneficiary. The trust is used to ensure funds are available for the care of the named beneficiary, not minimise tax. The 39% rate will increase unfairness and inequality when trusts hold funds for the future expenses of vulnerable people. (Trustees Executors Ltd) Submitters considered that the proposals are poorly targeted:  The proposals are targeted at only 5% of trusts (9,000 out of 177,000) but all trusts with trustee income will be affected. (C Wilson)  The tables in the Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) on the distribution of trustee income show that for most trusts, the non-application of the 39% rate is at best a minor explanation for trustee income. Any problem is with a minority of trusts, albeit Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 70 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] with most of the income. The solution should be proportionate accordingly. (Cantin Consulting)  The proposed increase to the trustee tax rate is a blunt approach and will disproportionately affect those who are not the target of the proposals. Most high-net- worth individuals operate highly sophisticated structures whereby most of the income derived is generated and taxed within corporate subsidiaries. (PwC)  There is little validated data on the number and size of trusts. Limited data that has been released by Inland Revenue suggests the median assets of trusts is only $830,000 (equivalent to owning a house), median trustee income is $8,000 and 68% of trusts (120,000 trusts) reported less than $180,000 of trustee income in 2021. Clearly, this demonstrates that while there may be some trusts with a lot of wealth, there are significantly more with less and these are the ones that will suffer over-taxation because of this change. (Deloitte)  Any tax measure must target the tax avoidance behaviour as opposed to adversely affecting taxpayers who are using trusts for legitimate non-tax reasons. (CPA Australia) Comment We acknowledge that over-taxation is a risk under current trust tax settings that will be exacerbated by the proposal to increase the trustee tax rate to 39%. Under the current trust regime, it is highly challenging to address the under-taxation of trust income by targeting the proposals to only impact individuals that earn over $180,000 in personal income and distributed trustee income. This is because trustee income must be taxed to someone in the year it is earned, and it is not always clear which trusts will eventually distribute tax-paid trustee income to an individual earning over $180,000 in personal income and tax-paid trustee income. Alternative approaches could more accurately target the proposals, however many of these approaches would involve significant departures from the current trust regime. This has been ruled out by the Government. See Issue: Alternative solutions to problem definition for more information. There are challenges with targeting the proposals based on the personal income of the beneficiaries of the trust. Trustee income is income that has not been paid to, or vested absolutely in, a beneficiary. Furthermore, most trusts in New Zealand are discretionary trusts – trustees generally have the discretion to add or remove beneficiaries. This means that in the year the trustee income is earned, it is not always certain which specific beneficiary will (eventually) receive the tax-paid trustee income when it is later distributed. Based on trust disclosure information, there is not a strong correlation between the amount of trustee income of a trust and whether a trust has a 39% beneficiary. The graph in Figure 2 shows, for $10,000 bands of trustee income, the percentage of trusts that made a distribution (taxable or non-taxable) to an individual earning over $180,000 personal income. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 71 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Every trustee income band contains trusts with 39% beneficiaries. This means that targeting the proposals based on the amount of trustee income would be imperfect. Figure 2: Percentage of trusts with a 39% beneficiary in 2022, by trustee income bands On balance, we are recommending introducing a $10,000 trustee income de minimis. This will help with the targeting of the proposals by ensuring that 27,000 trusts would not be affected by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Given the concentration of trustee income in a relatively small number of trusts, this would reduce the over-taxation of many trusts while still addressing most of the under-taxation of trust income. See Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Use of beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, C Wilson, Deloitte, EY, J Guthrie, KPMG, Patterson Legal, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, PwC) Submitters considered that the ability of trustees to allocate income to beneficiaries (to be taxed at the beneficiaries’ personal tax rates) would not sufficiently mitigate over-taxation: 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% zero 10k20k30k40k50k60k70k80k90k 100k110k120k130k140k150k160k170k180k190k200k >200k Trusts per trustee income band with a 39% beneficiary Trustee income per trust ($) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 72 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Trusts are established for a variety of non-tax reasons, and it is not always appropriate or possible to distribute income to beneficiaries to mitigate over-taxation. ( See Issue: Use of trusts for non-tax reasons.) ( ATAINZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, C Wilson, PwC)  Making beneficiary income allocations solely to reduce over-taxation may breach the trustees’ obligations under the Trusts Act 2019, and the terms of the particular trust deed. Trustee decisions must be made in the best interests of the beneficiaries and cannot be driven by tax considerations. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Perpetual Guardian)  Making distributions to lower-rate beneficiaries will result in increased compliance costs for trustees. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd)  The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a legislated duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to the compliance costs. In the absence of a de minimis, trustees seem likely to incur greater compliance co sts, which is at cross-purposes with this duty. (ATAINZ)  Deemed taxable income can only be distributed if the trust is able to make distributions of such income and has the funds to do so. For trusts with taxable income but no accounting income, simply distributing income to beneficiaries may not work as a solution to mitigating over-taxation, and over-taxation already occurs under the 33% rate but will be exacerbated by the increase to 39%. Examples include: o foreign investment fund (FIF) income in excess of dividends o situations where not all expenses are deductible, such as the denial of interest deductions for residential investment property. (Cantin Consulting, EY, KPMG)  The Bill commentary overstates the ability under current tax rules to mitigate over- taxation by using beneficiary income allocations. Under current rules, for an amount to be treated as beneficiary income and taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate, the amount must vest absolutely with the beneficiary and effectively be placed under the beneficiary’s control. Where trustees do not wish to put an amount at the disposal of the beneficiary, the amount is subject to the trustee rate. (EY)  In the case of estates, child beneficiaries usually have to attain a certain age before income can be distributed. By the time they can receive their share it will have diminished in value. (J Guthrie)  The terms of the will (which are binding on trustees of a testamentary trust) may prevent trustees from making beneficiary income allocations. (Public Trust)  Changes to the current trust tax rules are required to allow mitigation of over-taxation contemplated by the Bill commentary. Specifically, trust income should be subject to the beneficiary’s personal tax rates where: o amounts are allocated for future possession o amounts are credited to an account of a beneficiary, but the trustee cannot or does not wish to distribute a cash payment Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 73 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o a trustee settles income on a sub-trust on behalf of a beneficiary. (EY)  Beneficiary income allocations will not help mitigate over-taxation in the following situations where trustees are required to treat income as trustee income: o trusts with minor beneficiaries o employee trusts (employee share scheme trusts and superannuation trusts) where exact allocations are determined at a future time o trusts used as superannuation vehicles. (EY) Where beneficiaries under a trust have a personal tax rate lower than the 39% rate, in many cases they will appropriately be able to earn “beneficiary income” taxed to them at their personal tax rate rather than the 39% trustee tax rate. The 39% trustee tax rate in many cases does not create problems for lower tax rate beneficiaries as long as the trustees are prepared to vest income in or distribute income to those beneficiaries. (Patterson Legal) Comment Officials acknowledge that beneficiary income allocations will not be an appropriate or desirable method of mitigating the risk of over-taxation in all situations. Trustees will be required to make trade-offs between mitigating over-taxation by making beneficiary income allocations and retaining income for other reasons. This may result in increased compliance costs. The trustee tax rate only applies to income earned by the trust that is not beneficiary income – the underlying assets of the trust are not affected. The recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over- taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. This helps reduce the need for additional specific modifications and minimises additional complexity for the tax system. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Some submitters have raised concerns that trustees will not be able to allocate all trust income as beneficiary income due to income that arises under tax law, but not trust law (eg, FIF income and situations where not all expenses are deductible). Interpretation Statement IS 12/02: Income tax – whether income deemed to arise under tax law, but not trust law, can give rise to beneficiary income outlines when deemed income can give rise to beneficiary income. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 74 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: More beneficiary income allocations expected Submission (A Harmos, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson, Cantin Consulting, NZ Shareholders’ Association, Patterson Legal, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) The proposals will encourage distributions of trust income to beneficiaries so that income is taxed at beneficiaries’ personal tax rates instead of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate.  This will defeat the purpose of many income-generating family trusts, which is not to provide income to beneficiaries until they reach a level of maturity. This could reduce beneficiaries’ motivation to work, succeed, and increase a sense of entitlement. (A Harmos)  The proposals will encourage distributions to corporate entities to avoid additional tax. (A Harmos)  However, distributions to beneficiaries will be constrained by the trust’s objectives and deed. (Cantin Consulting)  More compliance costs will be incurred because of the proposals. (Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson)  If trustees are forced to make beneficiary income allocations to reduce the amount of tax paid on trust income, the income will become relationship property, which the partners of beneficiaries will be able to make claims to. This undermines the purpose of trusts settled to preserve assets for children and grandchildren. Trust assets and income could end up diluted because it is lost to beneficiaries’ partners when relationships end. (C Wilson)  The proposals encourage a bias towards distribution and expenditure, as compared to ongoing productive investment and long-term savings growth. (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) Comment Officials agree that the proposals are likely to result in more beneficiary income allocations being made where the beneficiaries of the trust are on rates below 39%. In some circumstances, trustees will be required to make trade-offs between making increased beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation and retaining income for other purposes. The trustee tax rate only applies to income earned by the trust that is not beneficiary income – the underlying assets of the trust are not affected. The recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the impact on many trusts with small amounts of income.

Issue: Behavioural shift from trusts to PIEs and companies Submission (A Bramley, A Harmos, C Macalister, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Patterson Legal, PwC, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) There will be restructuring from trusts to PIEs or companies due to the difference between the 39% trustee tax rate, the 28% company tax rate and the capped 28% PIE tax rate.  This behaviour will be tax driven and increase compliance costs and tax inefficiencies. (C Macalister, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd)  Existing investments may already be organised this way, so it is possible that nothing may need to change. (Cantin Consulting)  The proposed 39% trustee tax rate gives a look-through rate, but not look-through profit accountability on the distribution of profits to owners. Trusts enabled widespread tax minimisation. This amendment to tax rates needs to “stick” and not enable other more elaborate schemes pursuing the same end. There is little point in having capital gains taxes when income is manipulated into low-rate regimes. (A Bramley)  The introduction of the Trusts Act 2019 and other related disclosure rules has already resulted in a greater administrative and economic burden for taxpayers with trust structures. The proposed increase in the trustee tax rate may result in certain individuals and families deciding to move away from trusts and towards other ownership structures and options. (PwC) PIEs  A PIE cannot make the full range of investments that a trust can. This includes investments in rental properties and companies, which are more than portfolio interests. (Cantin Consulting)  Individuals who, absent tax incentives, may have chosen to manage long-term and superannuation investments through trusts will be further incentivised to use PIEs to access the top PIR tax rate of 28%. (EY)  More portfolio share investments and bank term deposits will move into PIE structures to reduce the income tax paid from 39% to 28%.

(NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) Companies  Taxpayers will be able to use companies to preserve the 28% company tax rate by retaining funds in investment companies, holding companies, or other more complicated schemes, to only distribute amounts to trustees when funds are needed by beneficiaries. (A Bramley, A Harmos, Cantin Consulting)  A company can generally be used to make all the investments a trust can make, although there are costs to establishing and maintaining a company. (Cantin Consulting)  Income-producing assets, like real estate or shares, are likely to be shifted to company holding structures. (EY)  Many trusts own real estate that is leased to an associated operating company. A significant portion of the profits in these structures is generally applied to reduce bank debt. The proposals will mean that these structures are subject to a 39% tax rate when profits are simply retained to repay bank debt. This will likely result in many trusts transferring assets, at market value, into companies owned by trusts, so that the tax on retained earnings is reduced from 39% to 28%. (OliverShaw Ltd)  Many taxpayers accept the difference between the 28% PIE and company rates and the current 33% trustee rate. However, they are less likely to be comfortable if the trustee rate is increased to 39%. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw Ltd) o This may drive negative behaviours, such as the use of companies to earn passive income. Restructuring investments is unproductive and costly. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Misalignment between the 28% corporate tax rate and the 39% trustee and top personal tax rates incentivises the retention and reinvestment of corporate earnings. (A Bramley, Cantin Consulting, Patterson Legal)  The proposals will disadvantage those who are unable to use companies. For example, in the farming sector, most farms include the family home. A corporate structure results in a major tax inefficiency where the owners have to pay a market rental for the use of the family home. As a result, trust structures are used, where the costs of the family home are non-deductible but there is no taxable deemed income based on market rental. (OliverShaw Ltd) Comment We acknowledge that even if the trustee tax rate is aligned with the top personal tax rate, taxpayers will be able to substitute or invest in companies and PIEs to access lower tax rates. However, trusts are a completely different legal structure, and they are not a complete substitute for companies and PIEs. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 77 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Substitutability with PIEs: Some trusts have investments that earn large amounts of income that could not be put into a PIE. These are primarily businesses that settlors or beneficiaries’ control, such as farms and SMEs. While the general population may not have many of these investments, they represent a large amount of the assets of high- income investors.  Substitutability with companies: Trusts have certain tax advantages that companies do not. Capital gains derived in trusts can be distributed immediately to beneficiaries tax free, whereas capital gains can usually only be extracted from a company upon liquidation or as a taxable dividend. Trusts can stream distributions to different beneficiaries and can be used for asset protection in a way that companies cannot. Also, the company and dividend tax rules are relatively more comprehensive than the trust tax rules. Therefore, there are some important advantages that would counteract, to a degree, the incentive for taxpayers to shift income from trusts to companies. This reduced level of substitutability means that increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% is likely to be a worthwhile step in addressing the under-taxation of trust income, even if no changes are made to the tax treatment of PIEs or companies. Inland Revenue has published high-level guidance regarding how it may view some taxpayer transactions and structural changes regarding the increase in the trustee tax rate: GA 24/01: Proposed increase in the trustee tax rate to 39%. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Misalignment and horizontal equity concerns Submission (A Bramley, Cantin Consulting, CPA Australia, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) A strategic approach should be taken to addressing the non-alignment of tax rates across the whole tax system, rather than a proposal to address the issue only partially. (Cantin Consulting, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd)  A more holistic review of tax rates is required to address imbalances between different investment structures. This should include consideration of the simplification of tax structures to encourage fairness and minimise scope for tax minimisation. (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd)  The 39% trustee tax rate will create a significant misalignment in the tax treatment for direct listed share investments held in a trust and those held in managed funds. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 78 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Accordingly, we disagree with the Bill’s proposal to apply a 39% trustee tax rate. (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd)  At a minimum there should be a plan to address the rest of the issue of having non- aligned rates in the tax system, or a rationale for only partially addressing it. (Cantin Consulting)  The reason we have non-aligned rates seems to be that while Parliament has legislated for more progressivity through the 39% top personal rate, it does not want the high economic costs of taxing savings and investment at such a rate. Thus, it has kept the company and PIE rates at 28%. Increasing the trustee tax rate contradicts the rationale behind these settings because trusts derive savings and investment income. (OliverShaw Ltd)  The 39% personal tax rate is targeted at high salary and personal services income earners not investment and savings income. Trusts should not be taxed at 39% since they do not derive employee or personal services income. The better approach would be to focus only on areas where companies, trusts, or PIEs are used to convert labour income (that should be taxed at 39%) into investment/savings income (that need not be taxed at 39%). However, this is not a major issue at present given the personal services income tax rules. (OliverShaw Ltd)  Increasing the trustee tax rate to 39% is an ad-hoc approach to the issue of income tax rate misalignment. This is recognised in the RIS, but it then argues that the proposal has merit because the 28% company rate is not a final rate and the capped PIE tax rate of 28% is available only to portfolio or passive investors. These arguments do not withstand close analysis. (OliverShaw Ltd) o The top-up of company tax on distribution of dividends may be many years later, or never. o No justification is given for allowing passive portfolio investors to have their tax rate limited to 28% while active SME owners may pay tax at 39%.  By increasing the personal and now trustee tax rates from 33% to 39% the Government is undermining New Zealand’s broad base low-rate approach. (CPA Australia). Comment We acknowledge that addressing integrity pressures arising from non-aligned tax rates across the tax system at the same time would be preferable to addressing the under-taxation of trust income alone. A cohesive approach to non-alignment would provide further, long- term benefits for the robustness and sustainability of the tax system. This would require making compatible tax changes to both trusts, PIEs and companies/shareholders. However, due to the reduced substitutability of trusts for PIEs and companies, we consider that addressing the under-taxation of trust income on its own is a worthwhile step forward in improving the robustness of the tax system. See Issue: Behavioural shift from trusts to PIEs and companies. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 79 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Negative impacts on direct investment likely Submission (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) The difference between the proposed 39% trustee tax rate and the capped 28% PIE rate will result in a bias against direct investment and towards managed funds, which will affect New Zealand’s capital markets.  The capital market flow from customers switching into PIEs could cause disruption and waste. The long-term consequence could be markets becoming less liquid and increasingly dominated by large overseas fund managers.  PIEs typically invest in the top 30 to 50 NZX stocks, so our new or growth companies will find it harder to attract capital from the direct investor. They may have to seek foreign investment to raise capital, which would be detrimental to the domestic economy. The proposals would have unintended consequences for the financial futures of New Zealanders.  Tens of billions of dollars of direct investment into NZX-listed firms is invested through family trusts. Shareholders are everyday New Zealanders who play a significant role in our capital markets, with nearly a quarter of New Zealand investors holding direct shares.  There are hundreds of thousands of “mum and dad” and young investors with relatively small direct share investments. These savings and investments are used for retirement, house deposits, or supporting family members. A shift towards PIEs, which are typically lower risk, could affect returns.  The proposals will result in New Zealanders who wish to make investment decisions themselves being penalised. We should encourage New Zealanders working toward financial independence.  We should encourage New Zealanders to take a long-term view of investing, rather than focus on tax impacts and minimisation.  There could be implications for KiwiSaver. Given most KiwiSaver funds are PIEs, and those PIEs invest in direct shares, more certainty on the long-term taxation of PIEs and KiwiSaver is needed.  Without certainty or a known timeframe regarding the potential for changes to the taxation of PIEs, there could be a scenario where trustees restructure direct shares into Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 80 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PIEs and then restructure them back if there are further tax changes. Uncertainty also poses challenges for individuals planning long-term investments. Comment We acknowledge that the proposals will encourage a behavioural response from trustees to restructure or invest in PIEs. See Issue: Behavioural shift from trusts to PIEs and companies. However, the trustee tax rate only applies to income of a trust that is not beneficiary income. Direct investments by trustees will not be affected by the 39% trustee tax rate if the investment returns are distributed to beneficiaries of the trust as beneficiary income. Furthermore, the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. The Government is not currently proposing to change the tax treatment of PIEs. Additionally, officials would recommend that any proposals relating to the taxation of PIEs be subject to public consultation through the generic tax policy process (GTPP). Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Misalignment with corporate rate unavoidable Submission (Patterson Legal) Although alignment of the corporate tax rate and the 39% trustee and top personal tax rates is desirable in the world of economics, there can be no question of increasing the corporate rate to 39%. International competitiveness keeps pressure to maintain corporate tax rates in line with other countries. If New Zealand is adopting higher than 28% personal tax rates, it seems inevitable that we will be living with misalignment of the company tax rates and top personal tax rates, as is the case for most countries in the world now. Comment We agree that there are sound policy reasons for the company rate to be lower than the top personal tax rate. As a small, open economy, New Zealand relies on foreign investment, which makes a high company tax rate difficult to sustain. Further changes could be considered to help ensure New Zealand’s tax system is robust and sustainable, despite having a lower corporate tax rate by comparison with the trustee and top personal tax rates. However, this would require further consideration and public consultation before being Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 81 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] proceeded with, and this would be subject to resourcing and prioritisation as part of the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Proposals will result in continued indebtedness Submission (C Wilson) A consequence of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate is that there is less left in a trust at the end of the year to pay down debt, so the indebtedness of the trust continues. Amounts left over after tax and expenses are deducted from rental income, or inputs from trustees, are used to pay down debt. Given the inability to deduct interest costs in buying property, trusts are now into negative cash flow and are paying for tenants to be in rental properties. Comment We acknowledge that a consequence of increasing the trustee tax rate is that the after-tax amount of trustee income retained in a trust will be lower. The recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Regarding the interest limitation rules, it is an intended policy outcome of the rules that the taxpayer is not able to deduct certain interest expenses. However, the Government is proposing to reverse the interest limitation rules, with details of timing yet to be announced. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Rationale for proposed modifications Submission (Patterson Legal) The proposed modifications for deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts are interesting. However, the identification of these two circumstances alone does seem somewhat random. The idea seems to be that the proposed modifications apply in situations Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 82 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where the burden of the 39% rate may not be able to be softened through beneficiary income allocations. Comment The proposed modifications in the Bill for deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts are aimed at mitigating situations where there is an additional risk of over-taxation. Similar precedents exist in the current exclusions from the minor beneficiary rule for (a) estates where the minor was alive within 12 months of the settlors date of death, and (b) for a minor for whom the child disability allowance is paid. Officials consider that deceased estates are at an increased risk of over-taxation because the beneficiaries of an estate may not be known to the trustees. This means that the trustees will not be able to use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation. Other jurisdictions also have special, time-limited rules for the taxation of deceased estates. For example, Australia has rules that tax deceased estates at a concessional rate in the first three income years. The disabled beneficiary trust modification is intended to help mitigate the risk of over- taxation for trusts settled for the care of disabled people. These trusts may choose to retain income as trustee income to be able to provide for the future care of the disabled beneficiary (or disabled beneficiaries). In most situations, we expect such trusts would continue to be able to allocate income as beneficiary income to the disabled beneficiaries. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 83 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES Issue: Alternative solutions to problem definition Submission (A Harmos, ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Cantin Consulting, C Macalister, C Wilson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Deloitte, G McKinlay, NZ Shareholders’ Association, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd, Taxpayers' Union, W Blake) Submitters recommended that the following alternative approaches should be considered: a. Taxing trustee income on a tiered tax scale. (Cantin Consulting, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) b. Extending the imputation regime to trusts. (A Harmos, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, PwC) o This would achieve the desired outcome of the proposals in a simpler fashion, without undermining the legitimacy and proper purpose of trust-generated and retained income. (A Harmos) c. Introducing an elective settlor-attribution regime where income derived by trustees can be attributed to and taxed in the hands of the settlor for tax purposes only, with the funds remaining held in trust for legal purposes. (Cantin Consulting, PwC) d. Introducing a “notional” distribution regime where income is deemed to be distributed to a beneficiary for tax purposes only, so that tax is paid at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate but the funds remain in the trust for asset protection purposes. This approach would be similar to how we currently tax limited partnerships. (PwC) e. Amending the definition of beneficiary income to include amounts paid or applied after balance date (which would otherwise be trustee income). (Cantin Consulting) Submitters recommended that, if the proposals proceed, the following approaches should be adopted: f. Introducing a de minimis rule for trustee income, where trusts with income below a certain threshold remain taxed at 33%. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Cantin Consulting, C Wilson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, G McKinlay, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd, W Blake) g. A settlor-interested regime that applies to trusts where the settlor has retained some or all the benefits arising from the trust. Trust income would not be taxed in the hands of the trustees but streamed to the beneficiaries (including the settlor). (C Macalister) h. Targeted rules to address integrity concerns, rather than subjecting all trusts to the 39% rate and addressing over-taxation in an ad hoc manner. (CPA Australia, KPMG) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 84 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] i. Taxing distributions of tax-paid trustee income to beneficiaries on the 39% personal tax rate at 39%. (A Harmos) j. Inland Revenue should be auditing taxpayers under the existing rules rather than amending the trustee tax rate. (Deloitte) k. The 39% top personal tax rate should be reduced to remove concerns about the differential between the trustee tax rate and the top personal tax rate. (CPA Australia, Taxpayers’ Union) Comment a. We do not recommend introducing marginal tax rates for trustee income. This approach would not only help trusts mitigate over-taxation, but it would also undermine the objective of the proposals to address under-taxation – all trusts would benefit from the lower marginal trust tax rates. The likelihood that trustee income is over- or under-taxed is not necessarily correlated to the amount of trustee income earned; a trust could have a small amount of income yet have only 39% rate settlors and beneficiaries. Furthermore, marginal tax rates for trustee income would also likely have a significant fiscal cost. b. Extending the imputation system to trusts was considered in early policy development of the proposals. This approach was ruled out as being significantly complex to design and implement. Despite the existing imputation system for companies and Māori authorities, Inland Revenue’s experience suggests that both taxpayers and tax agents find imputation one of the most challenging aspects of the tax system. The Government has decided that proposals should be implemented for the 2024–25 and later income years. Extending the imputation system to trusts would not be able to be developed and implemented within this timeframe. c. The Government has decided that proposals should be implemented for the 2024–25 and later income years. Introducing a settlor-based regime would result in fundamental changes to the trust tax rules that would not be able to be introduced within this timeframe. Making significant changes to the trust tax regime at this stage of the Bill risks introducing unintended consequences. d. Introducing a “notional” distribution regime would be a significant departure from the current trust tax regime and would not be able to be implemented for the 2024–25 and later income years. Making significant changes to the trust tax regime at this stage of the Bill risks introducing unintended consequences. e. We do not recommend amending the definition of beneficiary income as part of this Bill. Any changes to core trust provisions, if necessary, would significantly benefit from public consultation and further policy development. Any changes to the definition of beneficiary income would require further consideration and be subject to prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 85 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] f. Given the concentration of trustee income in a relatively small number of trusts, officials agree that introducing a de minimis for trustee income would help reduce over-taxation while still addressing most of the under-taxation of trust income. For further detail, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. g. Flowing income sourced from services to the settlors of a trust would be a significant departure from the current trust tax regime and could not be implemented for the 2024–25 and later income years. Making significant changes to the trust tax regime at this stage of the Bill risks introducing unintended consequences. h. Officials acknowledge that targeted rules to address the problem would be preferred. However, given timing constraints, we consider that any proposals in this Bill to address the problem need to fit within the existing trust tax regime to avoid the risk of unintended consequences and allow sufficient time for policy development and implementation. Given the flexibility of trusts, designing targeted proposals is challenging. See Issue: Risk of over-taxation. i. Taxing distributions of tax-paid trustee income to beneficiaries on the 39% personal tax rate was considered during early policy development of the proposals, but ruled out due to administrative complexity and concerns about whether this approach would address the problem. Unless robust anti-streaming rules were also introduced, officials expect that trustees would stream taxable distributions to lower-rate beneficiaries and tax-free capital distributions to 39% beneficiaries. j. The issue of the 33% trustee tax rate being a final tax with distributions of trustee income not being subject to tax, even if the individual is earning over $180,000 personal income and tax-paid trustee income, is an outcome of current tax policy settings. Auditing taxpayers in these situations would not address the problem. k. The previous Government decided to introduce a 39% personal tax rate in 2020 for the 2022 and later income years.

Issue: Trustee income de minimis Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson, Cantin Consulting, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, G McKinlay, NZ Shareholders’ Association, OliverShaw Ltd, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd, W Blake) A de minimis for trustee income should be introduced, where trusts with trustee income up to the de minimis are taxed at 33% and trusts with more trustee income are taxed at 39% on all trustee income.  A de minimis threshold balances the objective of maintaining the integrity of the tax system with minimising compliance costs for trustees. (Baucher Consulting Ltd)  A de minimis would reduce the need for specific exemptions, and address some of the concerns with the proposed special rules for deceased estates and disabled beneficiary trusts. (ATAINZ, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Cantin Consulting)  A de minimis rule would mitigate overreach (some overreach already exists but is tolerated at the 33% rate), ensure certainty, simplicity and minimise compliance costs. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  If it is not possible to delay the proposal, a de minimis threshold should be introduced to not penalise most small-value direct shareholders. (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) Submitters had mixed views on a potential threshold:  Some submitters considered that the 39% rate should only apply to trusts with: o A “suitable minimum exemption”. (G McKinlay) o Net income (before distributions) greater than $10,000. (Baucher Consulting Ltd) o Net income (before distributions) greater than $50,000. (ATAINZ) o Trust taxable income greater than $50,000. (W Blake) o Up to $75,000 for any trust with at least two named beneficiaries. This avoids those set up for sole personal benefit and would leave $37,500 per beneficiary. This amount of income would not be significant in avoiding the 39% personal tax rate. (C Wilson) o Trustee income (before any allocations) greater than (say) $100,000. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 87 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  A tiered tax rate should be introduced with the first $100,000 of trustee income taxed at 33%. (OliverShaw Ltd)  Given that the findings of the 2022 trust disclosures are yet to be made publicly available, Inland Revenue will be best placed to confirm an appropriate de minimis income threshold. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment Given the concentration of trustee income in a relatively small number of trusts, we agree that introducing a de minimis for trustee income would help reduce over-taxation while still addressing most of the under-taxation of trust income.  Trustee income is concentrated in a small number of trusts: Only 5% of trusts with assessable income in the 2021 tax year (9,000 out of 177,000) accounted for 78% of trustee income ($13.3 billion out of $17.1 billion).  Most trusts have relatively small amounts of trustee income: 75% of trusts with assessable income in the 2021 tax year (133,000 out of 177,000) accounted for only 2.5% of trustee income ($0.4 billion out of $17.1 billion). This includes 43,000 trusts that reported only beneficiary income (ie, they had no trustee income), those trusts would not be impacted by a change in the trustee rate. Based on trust disclosure information, the likelihood that trustee income is over- or under- taxed is not necessarily correlated to the amount of trustee income earned. As noted in Figure 2, any trustee income de minimis would result in some level of under-taxation. See Issue: Risk of over-taxation. We recommend basing the de minimis on trustee income after deductible expenses. This ensures that the trustees can reduce their income by any deductible expenditure incurred in deriving the income. The de minimis should not be based on how much income the trust has before beneficiary income allocations because there is not an under- or over-taxation concern with amounts that are allocated as beneficiary income; such amounts are taxed at the personal tax rates of the beneficiary. On balance, we recommend introducing a de minimis of $10,000 of trustee income for the following reasons:  Targeting the under-taxation of trust income: Given the concentration of trustee income in a relatively small number of trusts, a low de minimis threshold would help reduce over-taxation while still addressing most of the under-taxation of trust income. A higher threshold would increase the risk of under-taxation, reducing the fairness of the tax system.  Mitigating the incentive to settle multiple trusts: Submitters have noted that ongoing compliance costs for a trust can range from $750 to $1,000 (see Issue: Rules to buttress a de minimis). A $10,000 de minimis would provide a benefit of up to $600 per trust. A higher threshold could incentivise taxpayers to settle multiple trusts to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 88 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Simplicity: Keeping the threshold low means that additional rules to address the risk of settling multiple trusts are not necessary. Aggregation rules could be complex and/or have high compliance costs.  Fiscal cost and diminishing returns: As the trustee income de minimis threshold increases above $10,000, there are diminishing returns in terms of reducing the number of trusts affected by the 39% trustee rate and increasing the fiscal cost. A $10,000 trustee income de minimis would ensure that 27,000 out of 76,000 trusts would not be affected by the 39% trustee tax rate. This represents 36% of trusts that would be subject to the 39% rate (trusts with positive trustee income after deductible expenses and prior year tax losses). Although some of these trusts would have 39% beneficiaries, the risk of under-taxation in dollar terms would be very minor. Table 2: Trustee income de minimis thresholds De minimis threshold ($) Maximum benefit per trust ($) Number of trusts eligible for de minimis Estimate fiscal cost per tax year ($m) Estimated fiscal cost over the forecast period (to 2027/28) ($m) 1,000 60 12,500 (16%) <1 <1 10,000 600 27,000 (36%) 3 14 20,000 1,200 37,500 (49%) 10 40 50,000 3,000 48,000 (63%) 25 107 100,000 6,000 56,000 (73%) 51 217 180,000 10,800 62,500 (82%) 91 386 Note: apart from the $10,000 threshold, the above estimates are not formal costings and are only intended to provide an indication of the order of magnitude of the fiscal impact of different thresholds. If a threshold higher than $10,000 is introduced, special rules may need to be introduced to address the risk of taxpayers’ settling multiple trusts to take advantage of a lower tax rate. The above estimates are conservative and do not take into account any behavioural responses or additional integrity rules. Point of difference For the 2024–25 and later income years, trusts and estates with trustee income (after expenses) up to $10,000 should remain at the current trustee tax rate of 33%. Trusts with trustee income (after expenses) in excess of $10,000 should be subject to the 39% trustee tax rate on all trustee income. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 89 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Rules to buttress a de minimis Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw Ltd) Submitters did not consider the risk of taxpayers settling multiple trusts to take advantage of a de minimis to be significant:  Existing anti-avoidance provisions and the impact of compliance costs would mitigate this concern. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, OliverShaw Ltd)  The cost of settling a new trust (typically between $3,000 and $5,000) together with the ongoing annual compliance costs (variable but at least $750 to $1,000) would wipe out the potential benefit of a de minimis. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, C Wilson) Submitters considered that rules could be introduced to alleviate concerns regarding tax planning to take advantage of the de minimis: a. A specific anti-avoidance provision could be introduced, if necessary. (OliverShaw Ltd) b. An aggregation rule could be introduced, if necessary. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c. Alternatively, the de minimis could be restricted so that it only applies to certain trusts: o First, for inter-vivos trusts settled before 17 October 2020 (the date of the 2020 General Election) following which an increase in the personal income tax rate to 39% became likely. o Second, for the first inter-vivos trust settled by an individual on or after 17 October 2020. This would enable new trusts to be settled for non-tax reasons. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd) d. The de minimis threshold could be divided by the total number of trusts settled by a person, however this would unfairly penalise persons who legitimately settled trusts prior to the 2020 General Election. (ATAINZ) Comment Officials agree that the risk is low that the proposed $10,000 trustee income de minimis will incentivise taxpayers to settle multiple trusts given expected ongoing compliance costs to operate a trust would likely exceed the tax benefit of the de minimis. Given this low Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 90 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] incentive, we consider that a specific anti-avoidance provision targeted at arrangements or structures entered into to take advantage of the de minimis is not necessary. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue already has a robust general anti-avoidance provision. Given the recommended de minimis threshold, we do not recommend introducing aggregation rules or rules to split the de minimis amongst multiple trusts. Such rules would likely over-complicate the trust rules and create heavy compliance costs for a relatively low risk problem. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be declined. c. That the submissions be declined. d. That the submission be declined. Issue: Indexation of trustee income tax threshold(s) Submission (CPA Australia) If multi-tiered tax rate thresholds are allowed, we recommend that the thresholds are indexed to inflation. Comment Officials do not recommend legislating automatic indexation of a trustee income de minimis threshold. This would be inconsistent with other thresholds in the Inland Revenue Acts. Threshold indexation is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

Comment Officials do not recommend introducing imputation credit concessions. We acknowledge that taxpayers may breach imputation continuity requirements if they restructure in response to the proposed 39% trustee tax rate, however, providing imputation credit concessions without public consultation, and at this stage of the Bill, would risk introducing unintended consequences.

This will not be possible, nor appropriate, in all cases. Comment We acknowledge that there may be cases where beneficiary income allocations either may not be possible or may be inappropriate for disabled beneficiary trusts – the proposed modification aims to help mitigate this. For more information on the recommended changes to simplify and expand the eligibility for this modification, see:  Issue: Disabled beneficiary definition too narrow  Issue: Limit on number of beneficiaries  Issue: Power to add and remove beneficiaries  Issue: Receiving payments in relation to an income year, and  Issue: Applicable rate for disabled beneficiary trusts. Additionally, the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Disabled beneficiary definition too narrow Submission (A Rose, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 93 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The proposed definition of “disabled beneficiary” in the Bill is too narrow. The definition would exclude people who:  are based overseas, so do not receive support payments from the New Zealand Government (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  are not eligible for government support payments for reasons unrelated to their disability, eg, because they exceed income limits (A Rose)  choose not to receive government support payments (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG)  receive ACC payments (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  have reached retirement age and receive New Zealand Superannuation rather than government support payments for a disability (Perpetual Guardian)  are vulnerable and cannot make decisions for themselves, and (Trustees Executors Ltd)  have a loss of mental capacity or have substance abuse or addiction issues, most of these people are on lower personal tax rates. (Perpetual Guardian) The proposed definition of “disabled beneficiary” will have fairness issues:  Trusts with disabled beneficiaries that do not qualify under current proposals will be unduly penalised. They will be over-taxed, with the additional tax paid reducing the resources available to care for them. (A Rose, KPMG)  We support the intent of the modification. However, including some disabled/vulnerable people but not others within the definition is unfair and inequitable. (Trustees Executors Ltd) The definition of “disabled beneficiary” should:  provide a clear definition that is simple to apply and that extends beyond people who have lost capacity (Public Trust)  ensure all disabled and vulnerable beneficiaries qualify, regardless of whether they receive the Supported Living Payment or the Child Disability Allowance (Trustees Executors Ltd)  include beneficiaries who would be entitled to the relevant benefits, regardless of whether they actually receive the benefits in the income year. Parents, guardians or trustees could make reasonable inquiries to affirm whether the benefits would be available for the disabled beneficiary via a disclosure point in the trust’s tax return. Inland Revenue should also consult with other Government agencies on what information could be shared regarding eligibility and receipt of support payments as well as their duration (KPMG)  include disabled beneficiaries who have been assessed as eligible for government support payments for the rest of their lives, even if they don’t receive a support payment in a given year (KPMG)  not refer to the receipt of government support payments. (A Rose, Perpetual Guardian) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 94 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It may be suitable to apply the same disability criteria for the modification that applies to state disability benefits. (A Rose) The proposed rules do not adequately reflect how disabled family members are provided for. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Comment We agree that the currently proposed definition of “disabled beneficiary” is too narrow and needs to be broadened. The proposals were developed as part of the Budget process, so we could only undertake very limited consultation with other government agencies before the introduction of the Bill. As a result, the proposed modification for disabled beneficiary trusts was designed narrowly, with the intention of undertaking consultation to determine whether the definition should be expanded. The definition of “disabled beneficiary” needs to have objectively verifiable criteria to ensure it can be administered by Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue does not have the expertise to develop and apply a general definition of disability. A subjective definition of disability would significantly expand the eligibility, however it would also be unenforceable and risk allowing non-disabled people to receive a tax advantage from the rules. The definition should also target lower-income beneficiaries, as they may be at risk of over- taxation under the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Point of difference Extending the definition to additional support payments The proposed definition of “disabled beneficiary” refers to the receipt of government support payments. This helps ensure the eligibility criteria is objectively verifiable. The current definition includes people who receive the Child Disability Allowance or the Supported Living Payment on the grounds of restricted work capacity. We recommend extending this definition to also include people for whom at least one of the following support payments are paid:  The Disability Allowance, which is a weekly payment for people with regular, ongoing costs because of a disability. A person does not have to be on a benefit to qualify for the Disability Allowance. However, they must have a disability that is likely to last at least six months, as well as regular and ongoing costs because of their disability that are not covered by another agency. The Disability Allowance is means-tested, which suggests recipients are on lower incomes.  The JobSeeker Health Conditions and Disability, which is a weekly payment for people who cannot work, or are working fewer hours, because of a health condition, injury or disability. The JobSeeker Health Conditions and Disability is means-tested, which suggests recipients are on lower incomes. Since people who are not disabled can receive this payment, we recommend also requiring a person to have received this Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 95 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] payment for six months for them to be considered a “disabled beneficiary”. This would be broadly consistent with the criteria for the Disability Allowance, which requires a person to have a disability that is likely to last at least six months. In targeted consultation, the Ministry of Social Development advised that some disabled people start receiving this support payment before later transitioning to the Supported Living Payment (which is already included in the “disabled beneficiary” definition). Disabled people who receive New Zealand Superannuation We agree that the proposed definition of “disabled beneficiary” does not sufficiently cover people of retirement age. We recommend extending the definition to include a person if:  they are aged 65 or older, and  they satisfied the definition of “disabled beneficiary” in the income year in which they turned 65, or the previous income year. This would help ensure that disabled people who transition off disability-specific support and onto New Zealand Superannuation when they reach retirement age can continue to meet the definition of “disabled beneficiary”. Other criteria referred to by submitters Submitters referred to examples of disabled people who would not qualify under the currently proposed definition, and would not qualify even if the definition is extended to include people for whom the Disability Allowance and/or JobSeeker Health Conditions and Disability are paid. However, we do not recommend extending the definition of “disabled beneficiary” any further for the reasons set out in the table below. Table 3: Further criteria and examples referred to by submitters Criteria/examples Rationale for not extending definition of “disabled beneficiary” People who do not receive New Zealand Government support payments, for reasons including:  being based overseas  not being eligible for support for reasons other than their disability, such as exceeding income limits for means-tested support payments, or  being entitled to support payments but choosing not to receive them. The definition of “disabled beneficiary” needs to be administrable by Inland Revenue and simple for trustees to apply. Inland Revenue does not have the expertise to develop and apply a general definition of disability. A general definition would also be more difficult for trustees to apply. Therefore, we recommend the definition refer to criteria that is objectively verifiable and can be used as a proxy for disability. It would be challenging for Inland Revenue and trustees to determine whether a person is entitled to a support payment if they do not receive it, or whether a person receives a disability support payment from an overseas government. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 96 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Criteria/examples Rationale for not extending definition of “disabled beneficiary” People who receive other support payments that are not included in the proposed definition (such as payments from ACC). We considered extending the definition of “disabled beneficiary” to include other government support payments, including those made by ACC following an injury. However, we do n ot have any data on what the personal tax rates of recipients of other government support payments are, particularly if the payments are not means-tested. Given our recommendation that a flat 33% tax rate applies to trustee income of disabled beneficiary trusts (see Issue: Applicable rate for disabled beneficiary trusts ), we consider it necessary to limit the application of the modification to trusts with beneficiaries who have personal tax rates that are 33% or less. As a result, we do not recommend extending the definition beyond the Supported Living Payment on the grounds of restricted work capacity, the Child Disability Allowance, the Disability Allowance, and the JobSeeker Health Conditions and Disability. People who are vulnerable and cannot make decisions for themselves, have lost mental capacity or have substance abuse or addiction issues. We considered extending the definition of “disabled beneficiary” to include trusts with beneficiaries for whom:  An enduring power of attorney has been invoked because the beneficiary has lost mental capacity (invoked EPA).  A court order has been made under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988.  A court order has been made under the Mental Health Act 1992 for compulsory mental health treatment.  A court order has been made under the Substance Addiction Act 2017 for compulsory treatment for addiction. Extending the definition to include trusts with the above beneficiaries could result in a very wide definition. Given our recommendation that a flat 33% tax rate apply to trustee income derived by disabled beneficiary trusts (see Issue: Applicable rate for disabled beneficiary trusts), we consider it necessary to limit the application of the modification to trusts with beneficiaries who have personal tax rates that are 33% or less. We do not recommend extending the definition to include trusts with these beneficiaries since it is unclear if it would be sufficiently targeted towards low-income beneficiaries. We do not have data on the marginal tax rates of beneficiaries who have invoked EPAs or for whom court orders have been made.

Issue: Disabled beneficiary definition would increase compliance costs Submission (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) The proposed “disabled beneficiary” definition would increase compliance costs.  This would be detrimental to the beneficiaries the modification is intended to protect. (Public Trust)  Each year, a trustee would need to confirm if the beneficiaries have met the narrow criteria proposed. (Trustees Executors Ltd) Comment Officials acknowledge that the disabled beneficiary trusts modification would involve compliance costs for eligible trusts due to the need for the definition to be objectively verifiable for Inland Revenue to be able to administer the proposals. We have recommended changes to simplify the proposal to expand eligibility and reduce compliance costs.

Issue: Problematic to determine eligibility Submission (Deloitte, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 98 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Establishing eligibility for the modification could be problematic.  The proposed definition could create privacy issues. (Deloitte, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust) o The trust does not have information about whether a beneficiary receives a qualifying benefit. If trustees are expected to gather this information, is this consistent with the Privacy Act 2020? (Perpetual Guardian)  Because of their disability, some beneficiaries would not be able to answer the questions of whether they meet the criteria. (Trustees Executors Ltd) Comment Establishing eligibility for the modification may be challenging where a disabled person is in receipt of a support payment but does not wish to share that information with the trustees of a trust of which they are a beneficiary. However, we expect that in many cases, the family members or guardians of a disabled person will be involved in the administration of a trust settled for the person and will have the information required to determine whether the disabled person satisfies the definition of “disabled beneficiary”. If the trustees of a trust are unable to establish whether a disabled person satisfies the definition of “disabled beneficiary”, the trustees would still be able to make beneficiary income allocations so that trust income is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal tax rate. Furthermore, if the trust has up to $10,000 trustee income, it would be eligible for the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Limit on number of beneficiaries Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Trusts with multiple beneficiaries would be excluded under the proposed eligibility criteria, resulting in increased compliance costs.  This will result in many new trusts being created. (Perpetual Guardian)  The criteria do not address the treatment of existing trusts where the primary beneficiary is a disabled person. To qualify, they will need to be resettled or amended. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 99 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This would be unfair for trusts that are not a target of the proposals. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd)  The proposed rules do not adequately reflect how disabled family members are provided for, as there may be more than one disabled beneficiary in a family or the disabled beneficiary may be supported out of a general family trust. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  It is unclear how the exemption will apply if a trust has multiple beneficiaries, not all of whom are disabled. (Public Trust)  Trusts with multiple beneficiaries should qualify. The disabled or vulnerable beneficiary could be of primary importance, with their needs being the first consideration in the management of the trust. (Trustees Executors Ltd) o Trusts with multiple disabled beneficiaries should qualify. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Deloitte) o Multiple beneficiaries should qualify if they are within two degrees of blood relationship. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd)  The proposed amendments are complex and could be achieved in a simpler manner. The modification could apply to trusts established principally for the case of a disabled person (or persons). (EY) Comment We agree that only allowing disabled beneficiary trusts to have a single disabled beneficiary is too restrictive and could result in unnecessary additional compliance costs where there are multiple disabled people within the same family. Point of difference We recommend allowing disabled beneficiary trusts to have multiple beneficiaries, provided all the beneficiaries of the trust (ignoring any residual beneficiaries, who can only receive trust property if there is no longer any living beneficiaries) satisfy the definition of “disabled beneficiary”. We do not recommend extending the modification to trusts that have a combination of disabled and non-disabled beneficiaries. Although this would limit the availability of the modification, it ensures that only disabled beneficiaries benefit from the modification. This reduces the risk that disabled beneficiary trusts could be used to provide a tax advantage for non-disabled persons. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 100 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Power to add and remove beneficiaries Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Most trust deeds include a power to add/remove beneficiaries. A trust specifically set up to provide for a disabled person that includes such a clause will not satisfy the eligibility criteria for the disabled beneficiary trusts modification. Comment We acknowledge that trust deeds often include a power to add or remove beneficiaries, and that the proposed modification does not currently allow this. This rule is intended to ensure a trust cannot be settled for a disabled beneficiary, have income taxed at rates below 39%, and then have a non-disabled beneficiary receive the benefit of trustee income taxed at a disabled beneficiary’s lower tax rate. Given our recommendation that multiple disabled beneficiaries should be allowed, we recommend that there is no restriction whether a trust deed has the power to add/remove beneficiaries. For more information, see Issue: Limit on number of beneficiaries . Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Trusts created by a will Submission (Perpetual Guardian) When a trust is created via a will, and the will has other beneficiaries, will the disabled beneficiary trust modification apply? Comment If a trust is created via a will, the trust may qualify for the modification provided it satisfies the eligibility criteria. No distinction is made in the eligibility criteria between inter vivos and testamentary trusts. It should not matter if the will has other beneficiaries, provided the trust itself only has disabled beneficiaries (ignoring any residual beneficiaries). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 101 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Eligibility based on purposes of the trust Submission (EY) Trusts established principally for the care of a disabled person should qualify. This would achieve the Bill’s objectives in a simpler manner. Comment The definition of “disabled beneficiary” needs to have objectively verifiable criteria to ensure it can be administered by Inland Revenue. We do not recommend allowing trusts to qualify for the disabled beneficiary trusts modification solely based on the purposes of the trust. This ensures that non-disabled beneficiaries cannot receive a tax advantage from the modification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Receiving payments in relation to an income year Submission (Matter raised by advisor) The “disabled beneficiary” definition should not be limited to people who receive the relevant government support payment during the income year – it should also include people who receive a relevant payment in relation to the relevant income year. Payments can be paid in later income years in relation to an earlier year due to administrative delays. Comment Officials agree that eligibility should not be based on whether the payment was received during the income year, but that it should be based on whether the payment related to an income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 102 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Grace period Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) There should be an allowance for a remediation period whereby if a trust fails to meet the criteria, the trustees have a period of time to address the breach, enabling the trust to continue in the regime. Comment We do not consider it necessary to introduce a grace period for trusts that briefly fall out of eligibility for the disabled beneficiary trusts modification. We are recommending that the definition of “disabled beneficiary” allows a beneficiary to be eligible if the relevant government support payment is received at any point in time (including after the income year) in relation to the relevant income year. For more information, see Issue: Receiving payments in relation to an income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Applicable rate for disabled beneficiary trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY) Changes should be made to the tax treatment of trustee income of disabled beneficiary trusts: a. A 33% flat rate should apply. (Deloitte, EY) o Some disabled beneficiaries may be very protective of retaining their privacy and may not want to share the information required for trustees to calculate the beneficiary’s personal tax rate. (Deloitte) o While agreeing with what the Bill is trying to achieve, the proposed amendments are too complex. (EY) b. Trustees should be able to choose to either apply a 33% flat rate (the existing trustee tax rate), or the personal tax rate of the disabled beneficiary. The existing formula is overly complex and will create compliance costs, so some trustees may prefer to apply a flat 33% rate. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand). Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 103 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment a. The Bill proposes that where the modification applies to a trust, the personal tax rate of a disabled beneficiary would apply to trustee income derived by the trust. To simplify the modification and overcome the potential privacy issues raised by submitters, we recommend that a 33% flat rate apply instead. We also recommend a 33% rate because: o If a disabled beneficiary trust were allowed multiple disabled beneficiaries, it would be much simpler to tax trustee income at a flat tax rate rather than personal tax rates (see Issue: Limit on number of beneficiaries ). o A 33% rate is the status quo – the current 33% trustee tax rate applies to all trusts, including disabled beneficiary trusts. A 33% rate would provide consistency with other recommendations:  Issue: Trustee income de minimis, and  Issue: Tax rate applicable to trustee income of estates. Having consistent rates apply where there are variations from the proposed 39% trustee tax rate makes the rules simpler for taxpayers to understand and comply with, as well as for Inland Revenue to implement and administer. b. We do not recommend allowing trustees to choose between applying personal tax rates or a 33% flat rate. This would increase complexity, and there are strong reasons why simply applying a 33% flat rate is preferable. Recommendation a. That the submissions be accepted. b. That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption from associated persons rules Submission (M Marshall) An exemption should be added to Test 8 of the associated persons rules (section YB 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA)). The exemption should apply for all trusts where a disabled person is both the settlor and the beneficiary who has benefited (or is eligible to benefit) under the trust. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 104 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment It is unclear whether the submission is specifically referring to the disabled beneficiary trust proposals or disabled persons generally. It is unclear why either would require an exemption from the associated persons rules. Due to the lack of clarity regarding the problem, and the risk of introducing unintended consequences, officials do not recommend introducing an exemption from the associated persons rule in section YB 9 for disabled people. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 105 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DECEASED ESTATES Clauses 33, 62(2) and (4) Issue: Over-taxation of deceased estates Submission (EY, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, OliverShaw Ltd, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, PwC) A 39% trustee tax rate would result in over-taxation for estates.  Even under the current 33% rate, estates are over-taxed. (Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust)  It is estimated that only 50% of New Zealanders have a will. It is likely that a large portion of those who do not have a will would have lower-rate beneficiaries who would be over-taxed at 39%. If estates are included in the proposed changes, many wills may need to be changed to ensure lower-rate beneficiaries are not over-taxed. This will lead to increased compliance costs. (Perpetual Guardian)  The difficulties and costs in defining, implementing, and enforcing mitigating policies for lower-rate beneficiaries, who are not the target of the 39% trustee tax rate, clearly outweighs any gains of including them. (Perpetual Guardian)  The increase in the trustee tax rate will result in over-taxation and have a disproportionate impact on deceased estates. (PwC)  The Bill commentary indicates that officials are concerned about over-taxation of deceased estates when they are under the control of executors – this concern is well based. (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd)  A full review of the tax rules for estates is needed. Tax rules in this area seem overly complex and would benefit from a review with full input from the lawyers and accountants who need to operate the rules. This requires a full consultation process. (OliverShaw Ltd)  Although we support the efforts to mitigate over-taxation derived by deceased estates, the changes should go further in this area. EY) Comment Officials acknowledge that estates face particular difficulties in mitigating over-taxation. Unlike inter vivos trusts (trusts created between living persons), the beneficiaries of an estate may not be known in the income year the estate earns the income, so the trustees of the estate may not be able to use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation. To help mitigate this, the Bill includes a proposed modification for deceased estates. We are also recommending changes to this modification to extend its application and make it easier Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 106 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to comply with. For more information, see Issue: Deceased estates modification does not apply for long enough and Issue: Tax rate applicable to trustee income of deceased estates. A comprehensive review of the taxation of deceased estates, or the introduction of a new tax regime for estates, is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Any consideration or progress of these issues would be subject to prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Deceased estates modification does not apply for long enough Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Cantin Consulting, C Wilson, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Deloitte, Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand, EY, G McKinlay, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, PwC, S Lindsay, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society, Trustees Executors Ltd) The modification does not apply for long enough. Most estates would require longer than 12 months following a person’s death to be wound up because of:  the time required to obtain probate or letters of administration (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd)  assets held overseas (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, S Lindsay)  overseas beneficiaries (C Wilson)  issues relating to the deceased’s assets (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Trustees Executors Ltd)  issues relating to the deceased’s debts (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  disputes regarding the estate (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  the deceased person dying intestate (CPA Australia)  unheard of descendants appearing after a person’s death (S Lindsay)  delays issuing IRD numbers. (Public Trust) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 107 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submitters suggested various time periods the modification could apply for, which are set out in the table below. Table 4: Time periods suggested by submitters Time period Detail One year  At least a full income year after the date of death. (KPMG, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Two years  At least 24 months from the date of death. (C Wilson, EY, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd)  Two full income years after the year of death. (Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Three years  36 months from the date of death. (C Wilson, PwC)  Three full income years after the date of death. (CPA Australia, Deloitte, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  Three to five years, to reflect the actual period that an estate is in the executorship stage. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Four years  48 months from the date of death. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, G McKinlay)  Four full income years after the date of death. (Cantin Consulting, S Lindsay)  Three to five years, to reflect the actual period that an estate is in the executorship stage. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Five years  At least five years. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Three to five years, to reflect the actual period that an estate is in the executorship stage. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Based on income years rather than months  Applying the modification on an income year basis, rather than using a fixed 12-month approach, avoids the complexity of the currently proposed formula for determining the applicable tax rate. (CPA Australia) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 108 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Time period Detail  This would avoid the complexities associated with having to make calculations for part-year periods. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Until date of assent  The period starting from the date of death and ending on the date of assent. (PwC) Time limiting the application period of the modification  The submitter accepts the concern that estate administration can be drawn out and a time limit should be set. (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd)  A time limit should not apply for having to wind up deceased estates for tax reasons. The modification should apply for the duration of the deceased estate’s administration. This would not incentivise trustees to retain income, as the trustees have a fiduciary obligation to the beneficiaries to efficiently administer the estate, and wind it up in a timely fashion. They would likely be in breach of their obligations if what the Bill commentary is suggesting occurred (artificially delayed distributions). It seems unlikely that beneficiaries will seek to delay or defer the wind up of a deceased estate because this would delay or defer their access to any assets. (KPMG)  Estates in the administration phase typically have a limited life because they exist so that beneficiaries can be identified, assets gathered, liabilities paid, and distributions made to those beneficiaries. There is protection in the Trusts Act 2019 to ensure trusts are completed promptly in the form of trustees’ duties, one of which requires trustees to act honestly and in good faith. (Perpetual Guardian) Comment We agree that the currently proposed application period for the modification is insufficient because many estates would require more than 12 months to be wound up following a person’s death. We understand from consultation on this issue that:  85–90% of estates are not wound up within 12 months of a person’s death  the average estate requires at least 18 months to be wound up  85% of estates are likely to be wound up within three income years after the income year of a person’s death  particularly complex estates could take five years to be wound up. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 109 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Point of difference We recommend the modification apply for the income year in which a person has died plus the following three full income years to ensure it applies for a long enough period for most estates. While we acknowledge the fiduciary duties of trustees referred to by one of the submitters regarding administering an estate, we consider an appropriate balance nevertheless needs to be struck between ensuring the modification applies for long enough for most estates, while still ensuring it does not apply for so long that there are incentives to prolong the existence of an estate. Any estates that continue to derive trustee income beyond the modification application period would still have access to the de minimis recommended by officials, if eligible (see Issue: Trustee income de minimis). Where the de minimis applies, trustee income would be taxed at a 33% flat rate. The de minimis would help to mitigate over-taxation for estates that continue to derive income beyond the modification application period and have up to $10,000 trustee income in a year. Inland Revenue data indicates that 84% of estates have trustee income of $10,000 or less. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Extended period for deceased estates subject to court challenge Submission (Cantin Consulting) The modification should apply for a further extended period for estates subject to court challenge. A challenge should not generally extend the period the modification applies for when it is not justified. Court challenges are subject to court control to progress, and court/other costs would also need to be incurred. Comment We expect most estates would be wound up within the recommended length of time for the modification (year of death plus three full income years), for more information see Issue: Deceased estates modification does not apply for long enough. Introducing a special rule for deceased estates subject to court challenge would add additional complexity to the trust tax rules. To the extent an estate continues beyond this period, it would be eligible for the recommended trustee income de minimis if it has $10,000 trustee income or less (see Issue: Trustee income de minimis). Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 110 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax rate applicable to trustee income of deceased estate Submission (Deloitte, Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand, EY, J Guthrie, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, S Lindsay, Trustees Executors Ltd) The modification should provide the following tax treatment for trustee income of a deceased estate:  A 28% flat rate. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) o This would align with the PIE tax rate, which is a final tax. In most cases this would be higher than the deceased’s marginal tax rate. (Public Trust)  A 33% flat rate. (Deloitte, EY, S Lindsay, Trustees Executors Ltd) o Instead of introducing the proposed amendments, a schedule could be added into the ITA that would list different types of trusts (including deceased estates) and the tax rates that apply to trustee income for these trusts. The schedule would list that the rate for deceased estates is 33%. This would be simpler and consistent with existing treatment. (Deloitte)  A flat rate that is below 39%. The applicable rate could be determined by analysing the average income of estates and individuals in the year of death, and then basing the rate on where the average or median income sits in relation to the personal tax scale. (Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand)  The deceased’s personal tax rate. (Perpetual Guardian)  A concessional tax rate should apply for the first part-year if a person dies part-way through a tax year. (Deloitte)  Estates should be exempt from the 39% trustee tax rate. Trusts and estates are very different, they should not be subject to the same tax rules. (J Guthrie) Submissions on the issues associated with applying personal tax rates, which is what is proposed in the Bill as introduced, are set out in Issue: Complexity of deceased estates modification. Comment We agree that compared with applying the deceased’s personal tax rate, as is currently proposed, a flat tax rate is considerably simpler. A flat rate is easier for taxpayers to comply Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 111 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] with, as well as easier for Inland Revenue to administer and implement. Reduced compliance costs and complexity is particularly relevant given many estates have relatively small amounts of income. Inland Revenue data indicates that 84% of deceased estates have $10,000 of trustee income or less. A 33% flat rate would provide consistency with the recommended trustee income de minimis (see Issue: Trustee income de minimis) and the recommended changes to the disabled beneficiary trusts modification (see Issue: Applicable rate for disabled beneficiary trusts). It is also the status quo for deceased estates. We therefore recommend that the deceased estates modification should apply a 33% rate instead of a 28% rate to trustee income. While arguably a lower rate might be more appropriate, particularly where the deceased person had a lower personal tax rate before death, the deceased’s personal tax rate becomes less relevant the longer an estate continues. Given the recommendation to extend the modification to apply for the income year of death plus the following three full income years it is less appropriate to base the applicable rate on the deceased’s personal tax rate. (see Issue: Deceased estates modification does not apply for long enough) The personal tax rates of the beneficiaries of an estate may be more relevant to determining what an appropriate trustee tax rate would be for this modification, particularly if it were to apply for a longer period. However, for some estates, it may not yet be known who the beneficiaries are when trustee income is derived. Even when the beneficiaries are known, trustee income has not been distributed to a particular beneficiary in the year it is derived. As it is not yet known which beneficiary will ultimately receive the trustee income, it is very difficult to determine what tax rate would be the most appropriate to apply in the year trustee income is derived. Point of difference The deceased estates modification should be amended to provide that trustee income of an eligible deceased estate is taxed at a flat rate of 33%. This ensures consistency with other modifications and provides simplicity for taxpayers. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Deceased estates modification should apply automatically Submission (CPA Australia) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 112 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The modification should apply automatically, without the need for trustees of a deceased estate to opt-in. Comment If our recommendation that a flat tax rate apply is accepted (see Issue: Tax rate applicable to trustee income of deceased estates), then we agree that the modification should apply automatically to all estates. It would be sensible to apply the modification by default because it would be preserving the status quo for deceased estates (a 33% trustee tax rate). Making the modification automatic removes the risk that an estate unintentionally fails to elect into the rules. Applying the modification automatically is also administratively simpler for Inland Revenue. Point of difference If our recommendation to apply a flat tax rate instead of personal tax rates is not accepted, then we do not recommend that the estates modification applies automatically. Applying the deceased’s personal tax rate, particularly in the income year of death, is significantly more complicated than applying a flat rate. For estates with small amounts of income, the compliance costs of having to calculate the deceased’s personal tax rate could outweigh the benefits of being able to access the lower tax rate. For more information, see Issue: Complexity of deceased estates modification. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Complexity of deceased estates modification Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, CPA Australia, Deloitte, Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand, KPMG, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) The deceased estates modification in the Bill involves applying the deceased’s personal tax rate to trustee income derived by estates. This approach is complex:  What is currently proposed will increase compliance costs and complexity. (Deloitte, Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand, KPMG, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd)  The proposal will require multiple part-year returns and calculations because different tax rates could apply for different periods. (Digital Service Providers Australia New Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 113 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Zealand, KPMG, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd)  It is likely a personal date of death return would be necessary to establish the deceased’s personal tax rate. (Public Trust)  Clarity is needed regarding how to calculate the tax rates for an estate should a change in tax rate occur during a tax year. (Trustees Executors Ltd)  It is unclear how Inland Revenue will know whether tax has been calculated correctly if every estate has its own tax rate. (Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand)  This is a significant level of complexity for the small amounts of income that most estates have. If professionals are needed to prepare tax returns for estates, the increased costs will likely outweigh the tax benefits. If professionals are not used, there is a high chance of errors due to the high complexity. (Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand)  For estates, the difficulties and costs in defining, implementing and enforcing mitigation policies for lower-rate beneficiaries, who are clearly not the target of the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate, clearly outweigh the gains of including them. (Perpetual Guardian)  The submitter supports the proposed formula for calculating the applicable rate under the modification. However, they suggest there might be a simpler method administratively, such as a new tax return form that combines pre-death and post- death income and calculates tax liability by applying the personal tax scale. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  In Australia, a concessional rate will apply for the first three income years of the deceased estate. Using the income year instead of a fixed 12-month approach, the application of the complex formula method proposed in the Bill is avoided. (CPA Australia) Comment We agree that the current proposals are complex and should be simplified. We have recommended that a flat tax rate applies instead of personal tax rates, and that the modification applies for the year of death plus three full income years. This would remove the need to perform part-year calculations and apply multiple tax rates in the same income year. This would preserve the status quo for most deceased estates (see Issue: Tax rate applicable to trustee income of deceased estate and Issue: Deceased estates modification does not apply for long enough). Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 114 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Deemed disposition/reacquisition of assets at death Submission (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Death often causes a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the deceased’s assets. The deemed disposition and reacquisition should instead occur at the end of the executor’s administration of the estate (when either trustees are appointed to manage the ongoing estate, or the estate is distributed). This would allow the estate, when it is under the control of the executors, to be taxed as if the deceased was living. Comment Amending rules relating to deemed disposition and reacquisition of the deceased’s assets, so that the deemed disposition and reacquisition occurs at the end of the executor’s administration of the estate would be a significant change for the taxation of estates that would warrant public consultation before progressing. Further work on this matter would require further consideration and be subject to the prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 115 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] SPECIFIC TYPES OF TRUSTS Issue: Trusts within corporate groups Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) A number of corporate groups have trusts within their group structures, including “hardship” trusts, employee share schemes, or other trusts used for commercial purposes. They are not being used to shelter income and it is important that a tax system recognises that there are other reasons for using trusts that are not connected to a tax advantage. The 39% trustee tax rate will result in over-taxation for these types of trusts. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, EY) If the 39% trustee tax rate proceeds, trusts that sit within corporate groups should be excluded. This exclusion could be based on the nature of the trust and why it was established. Eligibility for this exclusion could require approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the corporate group meeting certain criteria, such as having a listed parent.  Alternatively, the ITA could define which trusts the 39% tax rate should apply to, which are by definition trusts in respect of which one or more settlors has natural love and affection for the natural person beneficiaries. For example, refer to section EX 46(6)(b)(iii) of the ITA.  Exemptions from the trust disclosure rules in section 59BA(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are a precedent. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Hardship and education trusts Trusts are used in some corporate groups to provide benefits to employees and/or family members of employees. Income is accumulated in the trust to support the beneficiaries of the trust, including supporting employees in hardship and providing grants for employees’ education. Although these trusts can have benevolent or charitable purposes, they cannot register as a charity under the Charities Act 2005 due to only providing benefits to a limited group of beneficiaries (eg, employees and their families). Although these trusts may have benevolent or charitable purposes, there are a wide range of other trusts that are not part of corporate groups but have similar charitable purposes. Introducing special rules for certain benevolent or charitable trusts within corporate groups without also considering other trusts with similar purposes would undermine the fairness of the tax system. We do not recommend introducing special rules for trusts with benevolent or charitable purposes. (See Issue: Trusts with benevolent purposes.) Designing special rules for such trusts while ensuring that the modification cannot be abused could be challenging. Hardship/education funds would be difficult to define for the purposes Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 116 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of a modification and could provide an opportunity for 39% taxpayers to received distributions of tax-paid trustee income that has been taxed at a lower rate. The existing charitable tax exemption is provided for charities on the proviso that certain requirements are met, including public accountability requirements to ensure that funds are used appropriately and a requirement that no individual receives a private pecuniary benefit. Similar requirements may be necessary for any special rules for hardship/education funds in corporate groups to help ensure that funds are used appropriately. It is unclear if these trusts would meet such requirements, given that the benefits of hardship funds and education trusts are provided to employees and their family members. Additionally, the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. This helps reduce the need for additional specific modifications and minimises additional complexity for the tax system. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Employee share schemes Officials also note that the trustees of employee share schemes are treated as nominees in all aspects, so there is not a trust for tax purposes. Such trusts should therefore not be affected by the proposed 39% trustee rate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Trusts with benevolent purposes Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Taxing trusts with benevolent purposes, including education trusts, at 39% is an overreach because the beneficiaries are generally not subject to the 39% personal tax rate. This will result in a reduction in philanthropy. Comment We do not recommend introducing special rules for trusts with benevolent purposes. The tax system already provides an income tax exemption for charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. Introducing a partial concession (a lower trustee tax rate) for trusts that choose not to register as, or don’t qualify as, registered charities would result in having a two-tier tax regime for entities with charitable purposes. Introducing special rules for trusts with purposes similar to charitable purposes without undertaking further policy development and consultation could result in unintended consequences. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 117 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Additionally, the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. This helps reduce the need for additional specific modifications and minimises additional complexity for the tax system. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Trading trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Where a trust has an active trading activity, similar to a company, it is unlikely to be a tax avoidance vehicle for investments. These structures are the same as companies and the income should be subject to the company tax rate. However, given that company tax is a withholding tax only, and may be subject to a top-up on distribution to shareholders, it may be more appropriate to tax trusts with an active business activity at the current trust rate of 33% rather than 28%. It is unrealistic that trading trusts could avoid the 39% trustee tax rate by making the beneficiaries employees of the trust and paying all the income to them as salaries or wages, which would be taxed at their personal rates. Trading trusts often hold significant assets and will retain some income in the trust to maintain the assets and expand the business. Furthermore, beneficiaries providing personal services to a trading trust generally receive remuneration commensurate with the services provided. Comment Generally, tax rates are based on the entity type or structure, rather than the use or purpose of the entity. Different entities and structures have different advantages and disadvantages. Officials consider that this is a situation where a taxpayer is not necessarily required to operate their business through a trust. We note that a trust-owned company is a common structure where the assets are owned by the trust but leased to the trading company for use. Introducing rules based on whether a trust has an active trading activity would be a significant change to the tax system. We do not recommend making such a change at this stage of the Bill. The recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over- taxation for many trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. This helps reduce the need for additional Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 118 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] specific modifications and minimises additional complexity for the tax system. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Securitisation trusts Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Council, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Banking Association) A securitisation is a transaction in which receivables (such as loans to consumers or businesses) originated by a sponsor (typically a finance company) are transferred to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) trust. The SPV trust issues debt securities to funders/investors and the payments on those securities are supported by the cash-flows from the receivables that have been securitised. Any residual profit in the SPV trust after financing costs, service charges and other expenses is paid to the sponsor, typically in the form of a trust distribution. (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell) New Zealand’s banking sector often participates in securitisation transactions, which are designed to ring-fence a book of receivables inside an SPV trust. The use of the SPV structure reduces credit risk and allows the SPVs to reduce the cost of funding these books, ensuring efficient, competitive funding is available, to the ultimate benefit of New Zealand businesses and consumers. (Financial Services Council, New Zealand Banking Association) SPV trusts are intended, by design, to be tax-neutral:  For funders/investors to be prepared to provide debt financing to SPV trusts, it is critical that the trust has no anticipated liabilities, including tax liabilities. A confirmation of tax neutrality is always a condition precedent to draw down of funding by the SPV trust, illustrating the commercial importance of the tax treatment. (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell)  Section HR 9 of the ITA allows certain debt-funding SPVs to be treated as a look- through vehicle for tax purposes. However, not all SPV trusts qualify for these rules. Such trusts are taxed under ordinary trust rules and achieve tax neutrality by distributing all taxable profit of the trust as beneficiary income. Because the beneficiary of an SPV trust is almost always a company, the taxable profit is taxed at 28%. However, in instances where not all taxable income can be distributed it will be subject to the trustee tax rate. (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 119 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Financial Services Council, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Banking Association) It is relatively common for securitisation structures not to use the debt funding SPV regime because:  the regime is not available to trusts with multiple originators where they are not all in the same wholly-owned group  if receivables that have been financed via a warehouse trust that has not been subject to the regime are transferred to a new trust, that new trust may not qualify for the regime  if not all an originator’s trusts qualify for the regime, it is easier administratively to have a consistent approach  some arrangements involve origination within the trust itself, and the regime cannot be applied in these cases (receivables must be originated by a corporate to qualify). (Australian Securitisation Forum) The proposed 39% trustee tax rate will result in over-taxation for securitisation trusts:  The proposal to increase the trustee tax rate to 39% will exacerbate the current risk of over-taxation under the 33% trustee tax rate where tax neutrality of the SPV fails. (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Council, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Banking Association)  Corporate securitisations may involve a unit trust, which will be taxed at the company tax rate. Where it is not a unit trust it is not sensible to tax the vehicle at 39% as it would result in overreach. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  The risk of having any SPV profits taxed at 39% rather than 28% reduces the attractiveness of SPVs and would act as a disincentive to the use of securitisation structures, to the detriment of efficient capital markets. (Financial Services Council, New Zealand Banking Association)  A 39% tax rate for a securitisation trust would have a flow-on effect to significantly increase the cost of funds to non-bank lenders and increase the cost of borrowing to New Zealand business and consumers who rely on the funding they obtain from non- bank lenders. (Financial Services Federation)  Securitisation trusts that have a single corporate beneficiary (provided the beneficiary is not a look-through company) should be taxed at 28% instead of the 39% trustee tax rate to ensure that trustee income of these trusts is taxed at a rate no higher than the tax rate of the corporate beneficiary, in the event of a tax neutrality failure for the trust. (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Council, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell, New Zealand Banking Association) It is usual for trusts that do not use the DF SPV regime to make beneficiary income allocations to a company within the sponsor/originator group. These trusts may be affected Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 120 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] by the proposed corporate beneficiary rule (see Issue: Corporate beneficiary rule and securitisation trusts). ( Australian Securitisation Forum) Comment Submitters have noted that confirmation of tax neutrality is always a condition precedent to draw down of funding by an SPV trust. Given that tax neutrality is an essential feature of these structures, we expect that securitisation trusts that are not in the existing look-through tax regime in section HR 9 are already explicitly structured to avoid deriving any trustee income at all. Therefore, how often such trusts derive trustee income is unclear. Furthermore, whether a securitisation trust derives trustee income taxed at 33% or 39%, tax neutrality will have failed. We expect that in most situations any trustee income will be able to be distributed to a corporate beneficiary. Given there is an existing tax regime for securitisation trusts, we do not recommend introducing special rules for securitisation trusts outside of this existing regime. There is a risk that making changes to the existing regime in this Bill would be complex and/or have unintended consequences. Further work may be undertaken for a later Bill on whether the eligibility for the securitisation trust look-through regime should be expanded, however this would be subject to the prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. We are recommending that securitisation trusts be excluded from the proposed corporate beneficiary rule. For more information, see Issue: Corporate beneficiary rule and securitisation trusts. This will ensure that if tax neutrality fails for a securitisation trust, they will be able to distribute any net income to a corporate beneficiary to be taxed at 28%. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Securitisation trust remedial amendments Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell) Further work is required on the following points to improve the taxation of securitisation trusts. These issues were previously raised by the Australian Securitisation Forum in its submission dated 29 October 2021 on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill.  A person should not be associated with a securitisation trust (or treated as holding related-party debt) simply because the person (or an associate of the person): Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 121 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] o is a settlor of the securitisation trust or has the power to appoint of remove the trustee, or o is a beneficiary, settlor or person with a power of appointment or removal of a security trust.  It should be possible to elect to use the debt funding SPV regime where receivables are transferred to a debt funding SPV by an entity (other than the originator) that would be eligible to elect, but has not elected, into the regime.  Notes issued by a securitisation trust should be excluded from section GC 18 of the ITA (Loan features disregarded by rule for transfer pricing arrangements).  Securitisation trusts should be excluded from the thin capitalisation rules. Comment These issues are outside the scope of the Bill. Progressing these changes at this stage of the Bill would risk introducing unintended consequences. We recommend considering these issues for a later Bill, subject to prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Superannuation schemes Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, EY, Financial Services Council, i-Select Ltd) Submitters raised general concerns about the ability of trusts that are superannuation schemes to mitigate over-taxation. a. Trustees of a superannuation trust have limited ability to mitigate over-taxation. o Superannuation trusts are required to treat all income as trustee income, despite beneficiaries of the trust being subject to lower personal rates. (EY) o The trust deed for some superannuation schemes may preclude distributions of beneficiary income being made to some beneficiaries before a defined age. Any superannuation scheme on a register administered by the Companies Office should be excluded from the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 122 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b. Distributing income as beneficiary income may not mitigate over-taxation for trusts used as a superannuation savings type vehicle by persons who wish to manage their investments themselves rather than using third-party savings vehicles. (EY) Submitters also raised concerns about superannuation schemes registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act). “Widely-held superannuation funds” are defined in the ITA as a retirement scheme within the meaning of the FMC Act that has 20 or more members. These schemes are taxed at a flat rate of 28%. Schemes that are not multi- rate PIEs and do not qualify as widely-held would be subject to the 39% trustee tax rate. c. Restricted retirement schemes within the meaning of the FMC Act should be excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and taxed at 28%. The restricted workplace savings scheme sector includes numerous schemes which are not multi-rate PIEs and are therefore taxed as widely-held superannuation funds. These schemes will fall out of the “widely-held superannuation fund” definition if they have less than 20 members, which is expected to be the case for an increasing number over time. In this case, they would be subject to the proposed 39% rate, even though no current pensioners within the sector will have had a 39% employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate applied to them. Winding up the impacted schemes is not generally practicable. (Financial Services Council) d. Single-member retirement schemes registered under schedule 3 of the FMC Act should be taxed at 28%. Schedule 3 schemes have always been at a disadvantage to PIEs and widely-held superannuation schemes because they are taxed at the trustee rate rather than at 28%. This will be compounded by the proposed 39% rate because all income of a registered superannuation scheme is treated as trustee income – it cannot be allocated as beneficiary income. Schedule 3 schemes are long-term retirement savings vehicles and are usually not fully accessible until a member has reached the retirement age. These schemes are not used as tax avoidance devices and should not be caught by the proposals. (i-Select Ltd) Comment a. We acknowledge that superannuation schemes have limited ability to mitigate over- taxation of trust income. However, generally, tax concessions for retirement savings have only been extended to entities that are widely-held to ensure that such funds operate on arm's-length terms and do not invest in assets owned by the investors or associated persons. We do not recommend introducing special rules for superannuation funds that are not widely-held. b. Officials do not recommend introducing special rules for private family trusts that are operated as retirement savings vehicles. Trusts are required to satisfy certain criteria to be considered a superannuation scheme under the FMC Act, including that the trust’s purpose must be to provide retirement benefits directly or indirectly to individuals. Private family trusts are not subject to the same requirements. Providing tax Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 123 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] concessions for private trusts operated as retirement savings vehicles could create tax planning opportunities and could have unintended consequences. c. We agree that restricted workplace savings schemes that fall out of the “widely-held superannuation fund” definition due to declining membership should not be subject to the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. The 28% tax rate for widely-held superannuation funds is intended to ensure that such funds have a similar tax treatment to PIEs. It is not intended that restricted workplace savings schemes (funds that cannot have new members) should be subject to an increased tax rate simply due to declining membership. Officials recommend introducing a provision to tax “legacy superannuation funds” (superannuation funds that were once “widely-held”) at 28%, to ensure such funds are not worse off due to the 39% trustee tax rate. d. We do not recommend introducing special rules for single-person superannuation schemes. Although these trusts cannot mitigate over-taxation as beneficiary income, many of these funds invest in PIEs; PIE income is capped at a 28% tax rate. Furthermore, settlors generally retain a large degree of control over these trusts and do not need to invest on arm’s-length terms. Providing tax concessions for these types of entities would be inconsistent with the widely-held requirements for retirement savings vehicles like PIEs. We expect that approximately 33% of the single-person Schedule 3 superannuation funds would be eligible for the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis, and therefore would not be affected by the proposals. The recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over- taxation for superannuation funds with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis. Point of difference We recommend that, from 1 April 2024, a flat tax rate of 28% should apply to a trust that at one point qualified as a “widely-held superannuation fund” and is either:  a trust listed on the Financial Markets Conduct (Designation of Restricted Schemes) Order 2016 as a Restricted Workplace Savings Scheme, or  a trust that is a scheme referred to in section 59A(1)(b) of the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990. This ensures that the proposed “legacy superannuation fund” 28% tax rate only applies to superannuation funds with restricted membership. The reference to the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act is necessary because those schemes were separately deemed to be restricted superannuation schemes and are not listed in the above Order.

Issue: Testamentary trusts (J Guthrie, OliverShaw Ltd, Perpetual Guardian, Public Trust, S Lindsay, Trustees Executors Ltd) Submission Testamentary trusts should be exempt from the proposed 39% trustee rate. Table 5: Submissions on exempting testamentary trusts from the proposals Submission Detail Testamentary trusts not used to avoid tax  Testamentary trusts are not established to avoid or minimise tax obligations. People do not die to minimise tax. (S Lindsay, Trustees Executors Ltd) Testamentary trusts are used to protect children and vulnerable people  The purpose of many testamentary trusts is to protect vulnerable people. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd)  Testamentary trusts are used to support children (including orphans) who have not reached the age at which the will-maker deems they can manage their own affairs. (J Guthrie, Trustees Executors Ltd) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 125 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submission Detail 39% rate would result in over-taxation  Trustees of trusts settled for children (including orphans) and vulnerable beneficiaries, distribute income as it is needed to ensure funds are available for their care. The beneficiaries are typically not on high incomes, so applying a 39% rate would have fairness implications. (Trustees Executors Ltd)  Beneficiary income allocations will not be possible where child beneficiaries need to reach a certain age before income can be distributed, which leads to over-taxation. Child beneficiaries will be unfairly disadvantaged. (J Guthrie)  In many cases, the deceased is on a personal rate lower than the current 33% trustee rate. This over-taxation will be exacerbated by a 39% trustee rate and will dilute the assets being held on trust. (Public Trust) Issues for testamentary trusts because of the deceased estates modification  The proposed special rules for estates will increase complexity for testamentary trust administration. (Public Trust)  For testamentary trusts, the difficulties and costs in defining, implementing and enforcing mitigation policies for lower-rate beneficiaries, who are clearly not the target of the proposed increase in the trust tax rate, clearly outweighs any gains of including them. (Perpetual Guardian) A tax rate of 28% should be applied to testamentary trusts  The terms of a will may not allow for beneficiary income allocations. In this case, the increased trustee rate would likely result in over-taxation. This will be especially unfortunate for vulnerable beneficiaries, such as orphans. (Public Trust)  Testamentary trusts are established via a will, so are not being used by high-income earners to avoid the 39% tax rate. (Perpetual Guardian)  A new, lower-rate tax category of 28% should be created for estates and testamentary trusts. (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 126 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submission Detail A tax rate of 33% should be applied to testamentary trusts  The tax rate for testamentary trusts should be 33% for the year of death and the following four income years. (S Lindsay) Comment Risk of over-taxation We do not recommend introducing special rules for testamentary trusts. The trust taxation rules do not generally distinguish between inter vivos trusts (trusts settled while the settlor is still alive) and testamentary trusts (trusts settled on the death of the settlor, often via a will). Officials consider that deceased estates warrant special rules because it is reasonably likely that the administrators of an estate may not know who the beneficiaries are. This poses a risk to the ability to use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation. A testamentary trust, similar to an inter vivos trust, is not expected to face the same limitation. For the most part, we expect that trustees will be able to use beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation, regardless of whether a trust is an inter vivos trust or a testamentary trust. Testamentary trusts and minors or vulnerable people Submitters raised concerns about testamentary trusts settled for minors and vulnerable people, and how a 39% rate would be unfair given the lower personal tax rates many minors and vulnerable people would have. While ordinarily the minor beneficiary rule would apply to tax beneficiary income allocations to minors at the trustee tax rate, testamentary trusts are excluded from that rule provided that the minor was alive within 12 months of the deceased’s date of death. For vulnerable people who are not minors, beneficiary income allocations would also be an option for mitigating over-taxation, provided the will/trust deed does not legally prevent beneficiary income allocations being made. A testamentary trust would also be able to qualify for the disabled beneficiary trust modification, provided it satisfies the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis would help mitigate the risk of over-taxation for many testamentary trusts with small amounts of income. Such trusts would not be affected by the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate. This helps reduce the need for additional specific modifications and minimises additional complexity for the tax system. For more information, see Issue: Trustee income de minimis.

Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 127 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Widely-held trusts Submission (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, PwC) Trusts with many beneficiaries (widely-held trusts), including those with a community purpose (community trusts), should be excluded from the proposed 39% trustee rate due to the risk of over-taxation.  It is not possible for a 39% taxpayer to use these trusts as an investment vehicle because the trust property is pre-determined, and the beneficiaries are identified by class. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  These trusts do not pose integrity concerns that justify a 39% trustee tax rate. (KPMG)  Existing or proposed measures will not help to mitigate over-taxation. Given the large beneficiary class of widely-held trusts it is not always appropriate or possible to make beneficiary income allocations. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, PwC)  Income will often be too significant for a de minimis to be effective and there may also be legislative requirements for the use of widely-held trusts. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Submitters have suggested that certain widely-held trusts should be excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate: a. Widely-held trusts generally. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG) b. Energy consumer trusts (ECTs). (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd) c. Community trusts. (ATAINZ, Baucher Consulting Ltd, OliverShaw Ltd) d. Māori post-settlement governance entities (PSGEs) established pursuant to Treaty settlement legislation to receive, administer, manage and protect settlement assets on behalf of their members. (KPMG) Comment a. Widely-held trusts generally: We do not recommend introducing special rules for widely-held trusts generally. It would be relatively easy for trustees of a discretionary trust to add additional beneficiaries (even non-associated ones if the eligibility was based on the number of associated persons). This could create tax planning opportunities. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 128 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b. Energy consumer trusts: Most electricity distribution companies in New Zealand are owned by trusts or local councils. There are 20 energy consumer trusts (ECTs) that are subject to tax. The beneficiaries of these trusts are the persons whose premises are connected to the energy company’s distribution network. We acknowledge that it may not always be possible for ECTs to distribute all taxable income as beneficiary income. On balance, we recommend taxing energy consumer trusts at 33% instead of the 39% trustee tax rate. Although we expect these trusts would be able to distribute income as beneficiary income in most cases, some of these trusts may face administrative issues or have restrictions in their trust deed that prevent this. We have no integrity concerns with providing an exclusion for these trusts because they are a well-defined group. c. Community trusts: A community trust is a trust established under the Trustee Banks Restructuring Act 1988 to acquire the shares in the capital of a trustee bank’s successor company. These trusts are exempt from income tax under section CW 52 of the ITA and would not be affected by the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. d. Māori post-settlement governance entities: We acknowledge that PSGEs may be at risk of over-taxation due to generally aiming to retain and grow funds for the benefit of their beneficiaries and future generations. However, we consider that changes to the existing Māori authority regime is a more appropriate avenue than introducing specific tax rules for PSGEs at this stage. Changes to the Māori authority regime would require further consideration and public consultation before being proceeded with, and this would be subject to resourcing and prioritisation as part of the Government’s tax and social policy work programme.

Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 129 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Tax treatment of Entrust Submission (Entrust) Entrust is an energy consumer trust and should be exempt from the proposed 39% trustee rate (and other similar community trusts if identified) on the same basis the Bill proposes disabled beneficiary trusts be exempt.  Under its Deed of Trust, Entrust is required to distribute all its income as beneficiary income, so it should not be affected by the proposed 39% trustee rate. However, it could be exposed to the 39% rate on unclaimed payments that under the Deed of Trust revert to Entrust and are then distributed to other beneficiaries.  Entrust cannot be used to shelter income that would otherwise be taxed at 39%, which is what the proposals aim to prevent. Additionally, only a very small number of Entrust’s beneficiaries would be 39% taxpayers.  Entrust withholds tax on unclaimed payments at the 33% rate in the year of original distribution so, with the agreement of Inland Revenue, Entrust has been treating the distribution of unclaimed payments as a tax-paid payment and not as trustee income. If Inland Revenue is comfortable with this past practice, that would alleviate concerns that the proposals could unfairly impose additional tax on Entrust’s over 350,000 beneficiaries. At the time of writing discussions with Inland Revenue remain ongoing.  Unexpected administrative delays could also result in Entrust distributions being paid after the date required for treatment as beneficiary income. Entrust should be taxed as a PIE, rather than a trust, for the following reasons:  Entrust has over 350,000 beneficiaries and holds a substantial asset for the benefit of the community. Applying the trust tax rules to such a large community investment entity results in rules that are costly to operate, complex and confusing to beneficiaries.  For administrative reasons, Entrust is unable to determine the individual tax rates of beneficiaries because the beneficiary’s initial and day-to-day contacts are with the electricity retailer, not Entrust.  The trust rules result in many lower-income families and individuals being over-taxed on their Entrust distributions. Based on Inland Revenue data, Entrust calculates that approximately 86% of its beneficiaries are on rates lower than 33%. A detailed investigation by Inland Revenue suggests that 70% are over-taxed. The amount of over-taxation can be refunded if beneficiaries file a tax return, but the majority of (especially low-income) beneficiaries do not do so.  The level of over-taxation is significant. Based on Inland Revenue data, Aucklanders are over-taxed by approximately $14 million on their distributions. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 130 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Under the listed PIE rules, Entrust would be taxed at a capped single rate of 28%. However, given Entrust’s many lower-rate beneficiaries, a 17.5% capped rate would be more appropriate. Comment Officials acknowledge that Entrust may not be able to distribute all its income as beneficiary income due to administrative delays. It is also clear that energy consumer trusts (ECTs), such as Entrust, cannot be used to shelter income that would otherwise be taxed at 39%. We are recommending that ECTs are excluded from the 39% trustee tax rate and remain taxed at 33% (for more information, see: Issue: Widely-held trusts). This would preserve the status quo for Entrust. We do not recommend taxing Entrust as a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Māori trusts Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, KPMG)  Not all trusts used by Māori for communal ownership purposes are eligible to be Māori authorities. Eligible trusts may also choose not to be Māori authorities because of the compliance burden. The 39% trustee rate will not be appropriate in these cases. If the proposals go ahead and a de minimis is not introduced, this is an example of an exemption that will be required. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Many Māori post-settlement governance entities (PSGEs) operate as complying trusts and would likely be over-taxed under a 39% trustee tax rate. PSGEs are established pursuant to Treaty settlement legislation to receive, administer, manage and protect settlement assets on behalf of their members. These trusts do not pose integrity concerns that justify a 39% trustee tax rate. (KPMG) Comment There is a risk that Māori will be over-taxed by the proposals. However, Inland Revenue does not hold ethnicity data for taxpayers, therefore it is very difficult to determine how exactly the proposals will impact Māori. During consultation, officials received feedback that it is likely Māori are over-taxed under the current 33% trustee rate, and that this will be exacerbated under the proposed 39% Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 131 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] trustee rate. Stakeholders suggested that using beneficiary income allocations to mitigate over-taxation is not always be feasible. We also received anecdotal evidence that Māori trusts tend to have small amounts of income. If Māori trusts have less than $10,000 of trustee income, they will be eligible for the proposed de minimis (see Issue: Trustee income de minimis ). The tax system provides targeted rules for Māori organisations that manage and own communal assets for the benefit of iwi, hapū and whānau. Organisations that are eligible to apply these rules are called “Māori authorities” and are taxed at 17.5%. Trusts that are Māori authorities would not be affected by the proposals. We understand that some trusts that should be eligible for the Māori authority regime are not, and many that are eligible do not opt into the rules, often due to compliance cost reasons. Māori trusts can have large numbers of beneficiaries, and it can be very challenging for the trustees to obtain agreement from all the beneficiaries to opt into the Māori authority rules. Changes to the eligibility for the Māori authority regime would require a comprehensive review beyond the scope of the proposals. Further work on this issue could be considered for inclusion on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Additionally, there is a risk that introducing special rules for Māori trusts at this stage of the Bill could undermine the Māori authority regime or have unintended impacts. Consideration of any proposals relating to the taxation of Māori trusts or Māori authorities would significantly benefit from public consultation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined.

The rationale behind this proposal is unclear and its need has not been demonstrated. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd) The proposed approach is not necessary or is inconsistent with the broader tax system.  The general anti-avoidance rule would be sufficient to address the concerns outlined in the RIS. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  The proposal is inconsistent with the broader framework of company taxation. (EY, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  The proposed changes go beyond addressing circumstances where trustees deliberately circumvent the tax rules and should not proceed. (EY)  It is unclear why transfers of funds from a company to another company via a trust are being singled out for taxation at the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. This is inconsistent with the taxation of PIE investments at 28% as a final tax. The proposal should be removed pending further consultation and consideration of the tax policy underlying the accumulation of profits in corporate structures and the taxation of PIE investments. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  Income of a company should not be categorised as under-taxed, simply because it is taxed at the rate set by Parliament for the taxpayer that derives it. Interventions to tax income of one taxpayer at another taxpayer’s tax rate should be reserved for cases of deliberate tax avoidance. (EY)  The proposal will have a distortionary effect on investment behaviour. The change is unlikely to have any additional revenue impact because taxpayers will simply favour corporate ownership of income-earning assets and activities. (EY)  Under general accounting principles, an allocation to a company that is not paid in cash will be recorded as a loan by the company to the trust. Under current law, a loan to a shareholder or a person associated with a shareholder will give rise to a deemed dividend if interest is not charged at the appropriate rate. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 133 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment The ability for trustees to shelter income in a corporate beneficiary (taxed at 28%) is a significant integrity risk that would undermine the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Currently, allocations of income to corporate beneficiaries are not common in New Zealand, outside certain specialised contexts. However, the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate to 39% would significantly increase the attractiveness of making such allocations. These allocations are a major issue in Australia, where the trustee tax rate is 47% and the corporate tax rate for SME companies is 25%. In Australia it is common, for instance, for income to be allocated by a trust to a corporate beneficiary owned by the allocating trust (referred to as a “bucket company”). The cash is retained in the trust or lent to a high-rate individual beneficiary, with the allocation to the corporate beneficiary left outstanding indefinitely. It is clear that the allocation to the corporate beneficiary has been undertaken for tax purposes, and does not reflect the intended economic outcome. We understand that these kinds of transactions give rise to significant compliance problems. Even when the income is not only allocated but paid to the company, taxing the income at 28% would be problematic. First, if the company is owned by the trust, then this allocation and payment is a very simple way to subvert the intended rate for trustee income. While the income is still in the trust (since the company is owned by the trust) it has been taxed at only the corporate rate. Second, if the company is owned by a natural person beneficiary, then again, the allocation to the company rather than the beneficiary effectively avoids the intended outcome of trust taxation. Nor is there generally any commercial reason for the income to be allocated and paid to the company, rather than to the natural person owner, who can then use it to invest in the company if they wish to. The difference between the 28% corporate tax rate and the current 33% trustee tax rate does not seem to motivate significant allocations of trust income to companies this behaviour in New Zealand. However, officials consider that the increased differential would lead to similar problems in New Zealand to those already experienced in Australia. It would be challenging to consider many of these situations as avoidance given the existing tax policy settings. Furthermore, a specific anti-avoidance provision would be difficult to target at the problem and could result in significant uncertainty. Officials note that contrary to Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand’s submission, it is not clear that there is a loan from a company to a trust when income is allocated but not paid by the trust to the company. While the trust does have a liability to the company, the company has not advanced any cash to the trust and may well not record the unpaid allocation as an asset in its accounts. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 134 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Genuine reasons to allocate beneficiary income to a company Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Deloitte, EY, OliverShaw Ltd) There are genuine commercial reasons a trust may allocate income to a company beneficiary:  While not common, sometimes a company will earn income through a trust. The proposal would tax such income when the company distributes it to a 39% shareholder at a 63% tax rate. (OliverShaw Ltd)  The company may use the income for capital improvements, expansion, day-to-day operations, to pay down debt, or for other routine commercial purposes. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY)  There are many commercial reasons why a company may not regularly make distributions to its shareholders. The absence of a distribution should not be interpreted as a sign of tax avoidance. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Trust structures are used to hold separate companies in start-up mode. This keeps the companies separate for creditor protection and because there could be third-party investors in the future. Funds are distributed from the trust to the companies for their use. (Deloitte) In Australia, a corporate beneficiary of a trust is used to hold onto distributions until some point in the future, when it can be distributed to individuals. There are legitimate advantages to distributing trust income to companies, including:  Companies pay a flat rate of tax on income, which can be more or less than the applicable individual tax rate.  Using loans to a corporate beneficiary to purchase and hold assets in a tax efficient manner.  A company is an efficient structure for wealth accumulation and asset succession.  While a trustee is compelled to distribute the income of the trust, a corporate beneficiary can hold those distributions and distribute the profit at a later point in time.  It may be possible for the company to deduct expenses from the income it receives from the trust such as distributing to a company that has carried-over tax losses from previous years. (CPA Australia) Comment We consider that the ability to shelter income in a corporate beneficiary is a significant risk to the integrity of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. It would be challenging to consider Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 135 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] these situations as avoidance given the existing tax policy settings. Furthermore, a specific anti-avoidance provision would be difficult to target at the problem and could result in significant uncertainty. Therefore, we consider that a specific rule is required to address this risk. Narrowing the proposal to target structures where the trust does not have an active business or where the corporate beneficiary does not actually receive the funds would be challenging and could be easily side-stepped. See Issue: Application of corporate beneficiary rule should be narrowed. Investing funds in a company The corporate beneficiary rule would not prevent trusts from investing funds in a company. If the corporate beneficiary has a real need for funds, either a shareholder beneficiary or the trust on their behalf can invest the money in the company by way of either a loan or some form of capital contribution. As a commercial non-tax matter, the amount does not need to be distributed as beneficiary income. Company owned by beneficiaries of a trust If a company is owned by beneficiaries of a trust, and if one or more of those shareholder beneficiaries of the trust is on a lower tax rate, the trust does not need to distribute beneficiary income to the company (for the company to then pay dividends to the shareholder(s)). The trust can allocate the income directly to that person as beneficiary income to prevent over-taxation. Multiple companies wholly-owned by a trust The inter-corporate dividend exemption in section CW 10 of the ITA provides that a dividend paid from one company to another is exempt from income tax if the two companies are within the same wholly-owned group. The proposed corporate beneficiary rule does not override the inter-corporate dividend exemption. This means that if a trust owns multiple companies, a dividend paid from one company to the trust, and then paid to another wholly-owned company as beneficiary income would be exempt from income tax. This dividend would not be subject to the corporate beneficiary rule because amounts of beneficiary income “retain their character”. The dividend is treated as if it was earned directly, rather than through the trust. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 136 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Concerns with example in RIS and Bill commentary Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte, EY, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society, OliverShaw Ltd) The rationale given for the proposed corporate beneficiary rule in the RIS is inaccurate. Paragraph 113 of the RIS states “There is no reason for taxing the income earned by a trust and allocated to a company in the same way as income earned directly by the company.”  Our long-standing trust laws aim to treat beneficiary income as if it were derived directly. (OliverShaw Ltd)  If a loan to an individual beneficiary is repaid to the trust at full market interest, this is not an “avoidance possibility”. If that is not the case, the trustees seem to have breached their fiduciary duties, which Inland Revenue could counter as tax avoidance. If considered necessary, a targeted avoidance rule could be enacted. (OliverShaw Ltd) Paragraph 114 of the RIS is factually incorrect. Paragraph 114 states: If the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary is the trust that is making the allocation, the allocation achieves nothing. The income effectively remains within the trust. The principal, or in many cases only, effect of the allocation is to ensure that the income is taxed at 28% rather than the trustee tax rate. While a subsequent distribution of the income by the company to the trust will be taxable as a dividend (with imputation credits attached), such a distribution may never be made.  There is no support given for this statement and it is factually incorrect. This assumes the corporate beneficiary has no purposes other than being a vehicle for tax avoidance. Beneficiary income distributions to corporate beneficiaries are made for legitimate purposes. The corporate tax rate is irrelevant to this decision. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Before making any resolutions to distribute beneficiary income to a corporate, the trustees need to factor in the application of the financial arrangements rules. Distributions to corporate beneficiaries can give rise to income where there has been a forgiveness of debt to the trust. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Example 21 in the Bill commentary appears inconsistent with the current tax rules:  Under the example, the trustee allocates an amount to a corporate beneficiary, but also lends that amount to an individual. For the amount to be treated as beneficiary income of the company, it must vest absolutely with the company. For that amount to then be lent to the individual, it would need to be lent by or under agreement with the company itself. Even if credited in account only, the company’s cooperation in not withdrawing the amount would be required. (EY) o The Bill commentary asserts that the “real beneficiary of such an allocation of income is the ultimate natural person shareholder in the company”. The ultimate Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 137 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] shareholders are in no way “real” beneficiaries of corporate income unless and until such time as the company distributes its profits by way of dividends. o This example may constitute tax avoidance, for which there are already appropriate safeguards. If officials consider current trust taxation rules do permit the example provided, targeted changes would be appropriate.  This example is a highly artificial scenario where income will be distributed to a company without actually being made available to the company because the trust is loaning the same amount to the individual beneficiary of the trust. The distribution is not valid because is not presently able to be drawn because the amount has been loaned to another beneficiary. (Deloitte) Comment We consider that the ability to shelter income in a corporate beneficiary is a significant risk to the integrity of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. We acknowledge submitters concerns that the situations in the RIS and Bill commentary are potentially tax avoidance. However, we consider that it is difficult to be definitive on the point given the existing tax policy settings. A specific anti-avoidance provision would be difficult to target at the problem and could result in significant uncertainty. We disagree that the example in paragraph 114 is factually incorrect. We acknowledge that tax forms just one part of the environment in which taxpayers operate, however it is unlikely that the corporate tax rate is irrelevant to the decision of a trust to allocate income as beneficiary income to a corporate beneficiary. Particularly so if the allocation resulted in the income being taxed at 28% rather than 39%. Officials do not agree with the submissions to the effect that example 21 in the Bill commentary is factually incorrect. For example, take the Deloitte submission that it is not possible to allocate income to a company and lend the same amount to a beneficiary. Particularly if the loan is repayable on demand, there is no conflict between the two steps. If there is equity in the trust to begin with, it will be possible to pay the distribution without calling in the loan. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application of corporate beneficiary rule should be narrowed Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, CPA Australia, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 138 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Submitters recommended that the proposed corporate beneficiary rule is not sufficiently well-targeted. The current proposal is too wide in scope and will capture many commercial, non-tax motivated transactions. If the proposal proceeds, the rule should only apply when:  The company does not have an active business. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  There is sufficient connection between the principal settlors of the trust and persons with material shareholdings in the close company. (KPMG)  The corporate beneficiary never receives cash corresponding to the allocation of beneficiary income. (CPA Australia, PwC)  Distributions are not paid to, or for the benefit of, a company within 12 months. This should be sufficient to allay Inland Revenue’s concerns that trust income has been otherwise used by a beneficiary or the settlor. (Deloitte) Comment We do not recommend narrowing the application of the proposed corporate beneficiary rule in the ways suggested. A narrower application risks creating tax planning opportunities that could be hard to counter. We do not recommend limiting the corporate beneficiary rule to situations where the company does not have an active business. Trusts will still be able to use an active business to shelter income from the 39% trustee tax rate. The corporate beneficiary rule applies if a settlor has natural love and affection for a (direct or indirect) shareholder of the corporate beneficiary (and that more than 50% of the voting or market value interests in the company are held by five or fewer natural persons). We consider that this ensures there is a sufficient connection between the trust and the company. Introducing rules based on whether a corporate beneficiary receives the distribution, or if it is simply only an allocation, would require introducing a different definition of the term “paid” in legislation. This distinction would be impractical and very challenging to enforce. We expect that this approach would also be easy to structure around. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 139 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Treatment of beneficiary income subject to corporate beneficiary rule Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Patterson Legal, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) The Bill proposes that beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule would be treated by the beneficiary as a capital gain amount. Beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule should be treated as:  “Available subscribed capital” rather than a “capital gain amount”. This outcome would be fairer because a capital gain amount is reduced by capital losses. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Exempt dividends rather than an “available capital distribution amount”. Available capital distribution amounts can only be distributed tax-free when the company is liquidated, and such amounts should be able to be distributed by the corporate beneficiary to its shareholders tax-free at any time, given the amount has already been taxed at 39%. o Affected companies should be able to maintain a tracking account in respect of distributions taxed at 39% under the corporate beneficiary rule, and distributions made by affected companies to their shareholders should be tax-free to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the credit balance of the tracking amount. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) o Affected companies should be allowed imputation credits for at least 28% of the tax paid (possible the whole 39%) by the trustees on beneficiary income subject to the corporate beneficiary rule. This would ensure there would not be double taxation when the amount is distributed by the company to its shareholders. (Patterson Legal) Comment Currently, allocations of beneficiary income to corporate beneficiaries are not common in New Zealand, outside certain specialised contexts. In the 2021 tax year, 462 unique corporate beneficiaries were allocated $503 million in beneficiary income from 323 unique trusts. This represented 7% of all beneficiary income. However, the beneficiary income allocations are not evenly distributed in this group, with 80% ($401 million out of $505 million) allocated by just 8% of these trusts (26 out of 323). We expect many of these trusts are involved in corporate structures, such as securitisation trusts. We have recommended that securitisation trusts be excluded from the proposed rule. For more information, see Issue: Corporate beneficiary rule and securitisation trusts. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 140 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Available subscribed capital We do not recommend that beneficiary income amounts derived by companies subject to the corporate beneficiary rule be treated as available subscribed capital (ASC). ASC represents amounts contributed to a company by its shareholders. Exempt dividends Providing that such beneficiary income amounts are treated as exempt dividends derived by the corporate beneficiary would not allow the company to distribute the amounts to shareholders tax-free. Under existing company tax rules, generally, any distribution or transfer to shareholders would be a taxable dividend. Tracking accounts and imputation credits Given the limited number of beneficiary income allocations to corporate beneficiaries currently, we do not expect many companies to be affected by the proposed corporate beneficiary rule. This rule will mainly prevent new behaviours emerging (ie, sheltering trust income in companies). Due to this, we do not recommend changing imputation rules to allow corporate beneficiaries to receive imputation credits for such distributions or introducing special rules such as memorandum accounts to track distributions. This would add additional complexity and compliance costs to the trust regime for limited benefit, and risk introducing unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Natural love and affection Submission (Deloitte, KPMG, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) The proposed corporate beneficiary rule applies if a settlor of the trust has natural love and affection for a direct or indirect shareholder of the close company beneficiary.  The proposed rule may not apply if the settlor is the sole shareholder of the company because a settlor cannot have natural love and affection for themselves. If the proposal proceeds, it should be amended to ensure that it applies when the sole shareholder of the close company is a settlor of the trust. (KPMG, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Interestingly there seems to be more concern in the Official Commentary for companies held directly by trusts, but these companies will not fall into the rules as drafted. (Deloitte) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 141 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  The proposed rule may not apply if the corporate beneficiary is owned by the trustees because it is not possible to have natural love and affection for trustees. If the proposal proceeds, it should be amended to provide that where the shareholder of a corporate beneficiary is a trust, then the rule would apply if a settlor of the trust making the distribution of beneficiary income has “natural love and affection” for the main beneficiaries of the trust which is the shareholder of the corporate beneficiary. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that the corporate beneficiary rule should be amended to ensure that it applies if a direct or indirect shareholder of the close company is:  a settlor of the trust making the beneficiary income allocation, or  a trustee of a trust (where a settlor of the trust making the beneficiary income allocation has natural love and affection for a settlor or beneficiary of the trust that is a direct or indirect shareholder of the company). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Corporate beneficiary rule and tax credits Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) If the proposed corporate beneficiary rule proceeds in its current form, it is logical to allow the trustees to use the tax credits (proposed section LE 4B in the ITA). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Corporate beneficiary rule and securitisation trusts Submission (Australian Securitisation Forum, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Financial Services Federation, Mayne Wetherell) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 142 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The proposed corporate beneficiary rule could apply to beneficiary income derived by a closely-held corporate beneficiary of a securitisation trust. This would treat such beneficiary income as trustee income taxed at 39%, creating permanent over-taxation. This would undermine the viability of securitisation transactions for sponsors that are closely-held companies. For trusts that do not use the debt funding special purpose vehicle (DF SPV) regime (see Issue: Securitisation trusts ), it is usual for the net income of the trust to be allocated as beneficiary income to a company within the sponsor/originator group. This practice:  reflects the economic substance of securitisation structures as being akin to secured borrowings by the sponsor/originator, such that any surplus (after meeting operating and financing costs) should belong to the sponsor/originator group, and  is intended to achieve tax neutrality for the trustee, which is a requirement of leaders and rating agencies and appropriate given that the trustee wishes to avoid the risk of being taxed on any unforeseen amount of income. (Australian Securitisation Forum) Across the industry, the amount of net income of a non-DF SPV trust that is allocated to a corporate beneficiary appears to be in the millions of dollars, ie, the net income amounts allocated from the trust as beneficiary income to a corporate beneficiary would not be small enough to qualify for a de minimis. While the majority of trusts are unlikely to have close- company sponsors/originators, some do, and they could be significantly affected by the proposed changes. (Australian Securitisation Forum) This issue would not apply to a corporate beneficiary from a sponsor group that was not a closely-held company – beneficiary income would continue to be taxed at 28% in this case. (Australian Securitisation Forum) To ensure that this exclusion is targeted towards securitisation trusts, a specific definition could be introduced into the ITA to adopt the existing definition of “debt funding special purpose vehicle” but with amendments to reflect the fact the securitisation trust would not necessarily be consolidated with the originator for financial reporting purposes. 6 6 The proposed definition is: Securitisation trust means a trustee of a trust: (a) that meets the definition of debt funding special purpose vehicle, disregarding paragraphs (a), (b) and (f) of that definition, and read as if: (i) in paragraphs (c)(i) and (ii) of that definition, the reference to paragraph (b) is replaced with a reference to paragraph (e); and (ii) in paragraph (d)(i) of that definition, the word “originator” is replaced with “a person who transferred some or all of their assets to the trustee”; and (b) the sole beneficiary of which is a company. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 143 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment We agree that the proposed corporate beneficiary rule should not apply to corporate beneficiaries of securitisation trusts. The intent of the corporate beneficiary rule is to prevent income being sheltered from the 39% trustee tax rate in a corporate beneficiary, it is not intended to impact the use of trusts in corporate structures. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted.

Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 145 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PROCESS, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION Issue: Guidance on areas of uncertainty needed (Cantin Consulting, KPMG, PwC, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Guidance will be necessary, well in advance of the increased trustee tax rate taking effect, regarding:  Distributions of retained earnings by companies owned by trusts in anticipation of the increase in the trustee tax rate. Many companies will seek to mitigate the impact of the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate to 39% by distributing retained earnings prior to 1 April 2024. Inland Revenue should issue clear guidance on the circumstances in which the payment of a dividend in anticipation of the increase in the trustee tax rate might constitute a tax avoidance arrangement. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  Mitigating over-taxation by making distributions of beneficiary income to beneficiaries on lower personal tax rates. The Bill commentary and fact sheet accompanying the introduction of the Bill note that beneficiary income allocations can be used to mitigate over-taxation. There is uncertainty under existing law about the tax treatment of beneficiary income that is settled by a beneficiary back onto a trust. Inland Revenue should issue clear guidance on the circumstances in which the distribution of beneficiary income might constitute a tax avoidance arrangement. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  Tax avoidance. Specifically, what pre-implementation measures Inland Revenue considers acceptable, and what measures would constitute tax avoidance for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. (PwC) Inland Revenue should engage with relevant stakeholders throughout the preparation of this guidance. The commentary and fact sheet that were published alongside the introduction of the Bill were subsequently amended to correct an error.  This has created significant uncertainty due to tax avoidance concerns and uncertainty as to how these rules are intended to apply in practice. (KPMG)  The Select Committee should consider how and why the original materials did not reflect the expected and intended effect. The Committee should recommend processes to ensure that materials accompanying a Bill fully and correctly reflect the policy intent. (Cantin Consulting) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 146 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment The commentary and fact sheet published alongside the introduction of the Bill included an example of a settlor of a trust (who is also a beneficiary) receiving an amount of beneficiary income. The example noted that the settlor could choose to settle that beneficiary income back on the trust to mitigate over-taxation. The commentary and fact sheet were amended shortly after introduction of the Bill to remove this example due to concerns regarding whether this example could be tax avoidance. Officials acknowledge that the change to this example has created uncertainty for some taxpayers. This issue arose due to the proposals and supporting material being developed under Budget sensitivity. The commentary and fact sheet were provided to facilitate discussion on the proposals in the Bill and not as an interpretation of the current law. Since the introduction of the Bill, Inland Revenue policy officials have been working closely with officials from Inland Revenue’s Tax Counsel Office to ensure that material published alongside the Bill that summarises existing legislative provisions is accurate. In February 2024, Inland Revenue published a General Article providing high-level guidance regarding how some taxpayer transactions and structural changes will be perceived by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue from a tax avoidance perspective ahead of the proposed 39% trustee tax rate taking effect. This General Article is available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Technical website: GA 24/01: Proposed increase in the trustee tax rate to 39% . This guidance notes that, based on Inland Revenue’s interpretation of current law, it could potentially be considered tax avoidance if income was allocated to a beneficiary taxed at a lower rate and then resettled back on the trust (rather than being paid to or left owing to the beneficiary), such that the beneficiary is not in reality benefiting from the distribution. Following enactment of the Bill, officials will also include a summary of how the changes in the Bill are intended to apply in a Special Report published shortly after the enactment of the Bill and in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Generic tax policy process Submission (ATAINZ, Cantin Consulting, C Macalister, KPMG, OliverShaw Ltd, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 147 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The GTPP has operated since 1994 to ensure better, more effective tax policy development. A particular feature of GTPP is building in external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. The proposals have not been subject to the GTPP.  This may result in unintended consequences, such as the 39% trustee rate having a wider application than intended. (ATAINZ)  The main reason the proposal to increase the trustee rate to 39% should not proceed is that it has not been considered fully and not been subject to the GTPP. (OliverShaw Ltd)  Amendments of this nature undermine the GTPP. The changes would benefit immensely from a government discussion document process. (C Macalister)  The issues with the proposed changes are now being addressed at the Select Committee stage of the Bill. This is what the GTPP was designed to avoid. (KPMG, Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society)  Proposals affecting many New Zealanders were not subject to public consultation. (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Comment We acknowledge that there was no consultation on the proposals before their introduction. Prior consultation was not possible because the proposals were developed under Budget sensitivity. Following introduction of the Bill, officials undertook targeted consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including experts in trusts and disabled communities, with the aim of testing the proposals and identifying areas where improvements could be made. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Timing of release of officials’ advice Submission (Cantin Consulting) The Select Committee should recommend the earlier release of documents that affect its work. Budget 2023 documents were proactively released on 12 July 2023. This did not provide adequate time for submissions to take account of the further information. Budget documents directly relevant to matters in the Bill should have been released alongside it, rather than on the Budget documents timeline. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 148 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials note the compressed timeframes between the publication of background tax policy advice to Ministers as part of the Budget 2023 proactive release on 12 July 2023 and the 14 July 2023 deadline for written submissions on the Bill. However, the RIS for the proposals was published when the Bill was introduced on 18 May 2023, alongside a Bill commentary. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Further consultation required Submission (A Harmos, Cantin Consulting) The proposal should be withdrawn or deferred. However, if it proceeds, the Select Committee should provide further opportunity to consider the amended proposal (if it is amended) and its drafting. (Cantin Consulting)  Since the proposals did not go through the GTPP, the Select Committee should publish officials’ advice to the Committee in response to written submissions (because the advice can be assumed to be at least an interim statement of the Government’s position) and invite further submissions to address officials’ advice and any subsequent publication of further information on trusts.  Consultation after the introduction of the Bill raised questions about the proposals’ problem definition and effectiveness, along with the tax system’s broader principles. Officials’ responses to those questions are unknown because GTPP has not been followed, so the Select Committee will need to consider submissions made in a partial vacuum. This issue is compounded by the lack of public information on trust tax statistics for the 2022 income year (when the 39% personal tax rate applied). This legislation is bad, ill thought through, and rushed. It is a toe in the water for increasing the current zero rate of death duty and probably capital gains. It needs a serious rethink and an honest debate. It does not achieve the key stated objective published – changes to current tax settings to ensure they are fair, efficient, and do not impede economic growth. (A Harmos) Comment It is a constitutional requirement that the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill is enacted by 31 March 2024 to set the annual income tax Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 149 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] rates for the 2023–24 tax year. It is not feasible to publish the Departmental Report, and then seek further public submissions on the Departmental Report, before reporting the Bill back to the House in time for enactment by 31 March 2024. The Government has decided that the trustee tax rate should be increased for the 2024–25 and later income years (beginning 1 April 2024 for most taxpayers). Deferring the proposals to a later application date would have a significant fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 150 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FOREIGN TRUSTS Issue: Foreign-sourced amounts derived by resident trustees Submission (Te Kāhui Ture o Aotearoa New Zealand Law Society) Section 78(1) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 replaced “New Zealand resident trustee” with “resident trustee of a foreign trust” in the opening words of section HC 26 of the ITA. This amendment appears to narrow the scope of the exemption for foreign-sourced amounts in section HC 26 such that it applies to foreign trusts only. This could mean that section HC 26 would no longer apply where a settlor is a transitional resident (despite transitional residents being expressly referred to in section HC 26(1)(a)). The changes in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 were intended to expand the foreign trust disclosure rules to apply to trusts that were not foreign trusts but that also utilised the exemption in section HC 26; not limit the application of section HC 26. Section 78(1) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 should be reversed. Comment We agree that the foreign trust changes in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 were intended to update the foreign trust disclosure requirements, and not to narrow the application of section HC 26 of the ITA. Point of difference This change should be made retrospectively from 1 April 2023, the date when the change to “resident trustee of a foreign trust” in section HC 26 was made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 151 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Taxation of distributions from foreign and non- complying trusts Submission (Cantin Consulting) The use of the trust’s balance date, rather than the New Zealand tax year, for determining the taxation of distributions from non-New Zealand trusts would reduce compliance costs and simplify processes. Distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts are taxed, firstly, in the same way as complying trusts; trust income which is distributed to a beneficiary in the year is taxed as beneficiary income. Secondly, for distributions that are not of current year trust income, they are taxed if the distribution is from a prior year’s trust income (for foreign trusts) and from capital gains (for non-complying trusts). Distributions are deemed to be from particular sources by an ordering rule. This ensures that what would be taxed if derived by a New Zealand resident is taxed on distribution to a resident beneficiary. There are compliance costs associated with this feature of the rules. Trust income of foreign and non-complying trusts is determined by applying New Zealand tax rules to the trust’s activities. This is determined based on a New Zealand tax year. This imposes further compliance costs where a trust has an annual balance date that does not align with the New Zealand tax year. This is because the trust prepares accounts and makes distributions based on its balance date. The beneficiary must restate the trust’s activities to align with the New Zealand tax year. This also creates uncertainty because the status of the distribution cannot be determined when it is received. Allowing beneficiary income for non-New Zealand trusts (ie, foreign trusts and non- complying trusts) to be determined based on the trust’s balance date, by election, rather than the New Zealand tax year would reduce compliance costs and uncertainty. Consequential matters arising from this proposal:  The election could be limited to trusts that must file income tax returns in their country of residence or principal taxation. A further possible limitation is that the election can only be made for trusts that are resident in countries with which New Zealand has double taxation agreements and/or information sharing agreements. This would provide comfort that information on such trusts can be obtained by Inland Revenue if required.  A difference in income may arise under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules’ fair dividend rate (FDR) methodology. FDR income calculated on a 1 April or, for example, 1 July basis, is equally correct and should not be a concern.  There may be expenditure timing differences from the use of the trust’s balance date to determine trust income, however this should be outweighed by the compliance benefits. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 152 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  An election to use the trust’s balance date would align the foreign tax paid by the trust with the beneficiary income calculated in New Zealand for that year. Any difference in foreign tax credits should not, in principle, be of concern because the foreign tax would be for the same trust income as taxed in New Zealand. Comment Allowing trust income of foreign trusts and non-complying trusts to be determined based on the trust’s balance date is outside the scope of the proposed changes in the Bill. Officials will consider this matter. However, further work on this matter would require prioritising and resourcing as part of the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 153 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] TRUST DISCLOSURES Issue: Trust disclosure rules Submission (C Macalister, CPA Australia, KPMG) When the 39% personal tax rate was enacted, increased trust disclosure requirements were also introduced for the 2021–22 and later income years. a. The justification for the trust disclosure rules no longer exists if the top personal and trustee tax rates are the same and the compliance costs are significant. The disclosure rules should be repealed or amended to reduce compliance costs. (C Macalister, CPA Australia, KPMG) b. Delegating the design of the disclosure rules to Inland Revenue is contrary to good tax policy and tax law. While it may be permissible from a legislative point of view, these changes have resulted in increased uncertainty and compliance costs. Furthermore, delegating the detailed design to an Inland Revenue form is outside the spirit of the development of tax law. New Zealand has benefited from good and meaningful consultation, and leaving the design to Inland Revenue operations is a departure from this approach. (C Macalister) c. The Finance and Expenditure Committee should invite officials to release details of the disclosure information collected. (C Macalister) Comment The increased disclosure requirements were introduced not just to gain insight into whether the 39% personal tax rate is working effectively, but also to provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees. Information disclosed to date is helping to identify previous areas of non-compliance and other policy issues. We expect that disclosure information will help identify non-compliance relating to the proposed increase in the trustee tax rate for the 2024–25 year, including anticipated behavioural responses before and after the rate change. The disclosures are delivering insights outside of issues relating to the difference between the 33% trustee tax rate and the 39% personal tax rate, including wider benefits such as improving New Zealand’s international reputation in relation to transparency of beneficial ownership. Due to these wider benefits, consideration of changes to the requirements is outside the scope of the Bill. Officials acknowledge that the increased disclosure requirements were introduced with limited consultation. However, since the requirements were enacted in legislation, Inland Revenue undertook multiple rounds of consultation in 2021 to refine and implement the Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 154 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] rules. The detailed design of most information collected by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is set out in forms prescribed by the Commissioner. A post-implementation review to determine ways to improve and simplify future disclosures is planned for 2024. Officials recommend that any changes to the disclosures be considered as part of that review. Since the closing date for written submissions on the Bill, a high-level summary of data and insights from the first year of the disclosure rules (the 2022 tax year) was published on Inland Revenue’s website: https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/revenue-refunds/trusts- and-estates-statistics/trust-disclosure-information-from-the-2022-tax-year. Recommendation a. That the submissions be declined. b. That the submission be declined. c. That the submission be declined. Issue: Trust disclosures and non-active trusts Submission (Public Trust, Trustees Executors Ltd) Section 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides an exclusion for trustees of non- active trusts and executors or administrators of non-active estates from their tax filing obligations. Trustees that are excluded from their tax filing obligations under section 43B are also excluded from the trust disclosure requirements. One of the requirements to be a non-active trust is that it must be a complying trust. This means that the tax obligations relating to the trustee’s income tax liability must have been satisfied for every tax year (refer section HC 10 of the ITA). The proposed 39% trustee tax rate will have an impact on the ability of trusts to qualify as a non-active trust:  If the trustee tax rate is increased to 39%, then an estate tax return will need to be filed because withholding tax rates are less than 39%. This will increase compliance costs for taxpayers (Public Trust).  The interaction between the above requirement for trustees of non-active trusts to have satisfied all their tax obligations and the ability to derive income with tax withheld at rates lower than 39% should be clarified (Trustees Executors Ltd). Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 155 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment To qualify as a non-active trust under section 43B:  a trust or estate must not earn more than $1,000 reportable income (eg, interest or dividend income), and  a testamentary trust must not earn more than $5,000 reportable income. The requirement to earn less than $1,000 or $5,000 reportable income, respectively, means that any trust that would be eligible for non-active status would also qualify for the recommended $10,000 trustee income de minimis. (see Issue: Trustee income de minimis). Since all trustee income of trusts eligible for the de minimis would be taxed at 33%, the proposals would have no impact on trusts eligible to be non-active. Such trusts can continue to derive interest and dividend income that has had resident withholding tax (RWT) withheld at 33% and still be excused from filing obligations and the trust disclosure requirements. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Comments on trust disclosure insights Submission (Cantin Consulting) In November 2022, Inland Revenue published a report summarising insights from the first year of the trust disclosure rules. 7  Inland Revenue has highlighted the difference in beneficiary income paid to minors (under 16-year-olds) and 16–20-year-olds. For minor beneficiaries, the tax rate is 33% whether the income is allocated to them as beneficiary income – whether it is minor beneficiary income or trustee income, makes no difference to the tax payable. This is not unacceptable planning but a natural consequence of the rules.  Some of the data is “point in time” because it is the first time that disclosures have been required. The reasons for the noted outcomes should be explored further.  The report discloses possible errors made by trustees and beneficiaries. The errors raise some policy questions: o Should Inland Revenue have already identified these types of errors? Some may not have been because they were identified from information disclosed for the 7 https://www.ird.govt.nz/about-us/tax-statistics/revenue-refunds/trusts-and-estates-statistics/trust- disclosure-information-from-the-2022-tax-year Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 156 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] first time (such as non-taxable distributions), others will have been disclosed historically. o Is the relevant rule fit for purpose? The report discloses possible errors but does not report on those in similar circumstances who have complied. For example, how many taxpayers (and how much income) correctly reported family scheme income? This information may be useful in assessing whether the rules are sufficiently clear or communicated to affected taxpayers.  Some caution is required in concluding that a tax rate is the underlying reason for a certain behaviour.  Any good report raises further questions, which this report does. However, some of these questions are due to gaps that can be remedied with existing data (PIE income for example).  It would be helpful for Inland Revenue to disclose the data used for the graphs to allow contestability and quality assurance. Comment These matters are outside the scope of the Bill. Officials note the points raised by the submitter and will consider these issues further. We expect that the second year of trust disclosure insights will shed further insights and allow year-by-year analysis to help understand these matters. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 157 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OTHER COMMENTS REGARDING TRUSTS Clause 62(1)(b) Issue: Minor beneficiary tax rate should remain at 33% Submission (OliverShaw Ltd) The minor beneficiary tax rate should remain at 33%. The minor beneficiary rule was introduced in reaction to family trusts allocating relatively small sums of money to minor beneficiaries to fund what would be considered normal household expenses. The rule ensures the income is taxed at 33% (as it would be if derived directly by the parents) rather than the 10.5% or 17.5% rate that would apply if the beneficiary income were the only income of the child. The trustee rate of 33% was seen as reasonable in these circumstances, and applied even when the top personal rate was 39%. There is no justification for taxing a child at 39% on small allowances provided by a trust established by the child’s grandparents when a 17-year-old sibling is taxed at say 10.5%. The proposed increase to the minor beneficiary rule should not proceed. Comment The minor beneficiary rule applies to tax amounts of beneficiary income allocated to minors (people aged under 16 years of age) at the trustee tax rate. This means that for trusts eligible for one of the recommended modifications (disabled beneficiary trusts, deceased estates or a trust with up to $10,000 trustee income), minor beneficiary income will continue to be taxed at 33%. People, including families with minor children, typically meet their expenses out of income that has been taxed at their personal tax rates. The minor beneficiary rule is aimed at ensuring families with a trust do not gain a tax advantage over families without a trust. If the minor beneficiary rule remained at 33%, parents and close relatives with a 39% personal tax rate would be able to satisfy their expenses out of trust income that is allocated to a minor beneficiary and taxed at 33%. This would undermine the proposed 39% trustee tax rate. Furthermore, the minor beneficiary rule does not apply if the total amount of beneficiary income that the minor earns from the trust in an income year is $1,000 or less. This ensures that distributions of small allowances to minors are not affected by the minor beneficiary rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 158 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Concerns with revenue estimate for the proposals Submission (Cantin Consulting, EY, OliverShaw Ltd, Patterson Legal) Submitters made various comments on the revenue forecast for the proposals:  A significant number of taxpayers act affirmatively to reduce taxes now that the top personal tax rate has become 39% rather than 33%. The increased tax revenue from the proposed 39% trustee tax rate may not match the amounts forecast by Inland Revenue. In the RIS, Inland Revenue recognised that the amount of tax collected can depend significantly on taxpayers’ behavioural response, particularly if there are different options available to taxpayers. (Patterson Legal)  The $13 million forecast for the 2024–25 year is too low. Profitability since 2021 should be taken into account when assessing the actual tax collected and its effect on future forecasts. (Cantin Consulting)  The forecast tax revenue of $350 million per annum assumes $5.8 billion of trustee income. This compares to $11.4 billion returned in 2020, and $17.1 billion in 2021. It is sensible to ignore the 2021 year. Assuming the 2020 year base, the forecast assumes that approximately $6 billion of what would otherwise be trustee income will be subject to one of three options for reducing tax (companies, PIEs or distributions to beneficiaries). The reasonableness of this assumption should be tested. (Cantin Consulting)  The complex and costly restructures involved will result in little net revenue flowing to the Government. This would involve a net welfare cost to New Zealand and would materially reduce the forecast revenue gain to the Government ($350 million per annum), given these estimates are stated to be based on a moderate behavioural response. (OliverShaw Ltd)  The likelihood of over-taxation may result in a behavioural response that results in a reduction in overall tax revenue. EY) Comment The RIS acknowledges that the revenue raised from the proposals is uncertain and heavily dependent on the behavioural responses of trustees. The revenue estimates were forecasted based on the 2020 tax year; at the time, not all tax returns for the 2021 tax year had been filed. The estimated $13 million fiscal gain for the 2024–25 fiscal year is due to information flows. The timing lag in the revenue estimate is due to information flows: the first year of affected tax returns (2024–25 tax year) need to be filed before the additional income tax is recognised, and the second year is simultaneously accrued on the basis of that new information. The revenue estimate of $13 million for the 2024–25 fiscal year is due to Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 159 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] provisional taxpayers using estimates, for whom there will be an impact within the 2024–25 fiscal year. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Revenue raised should be spent effectively Submission (Patterson Legal) When taxes are increased or reinforced, the Government needs to spend the money raised by the taxes effectively and be perceived to be doing so. People are less likely to object to a tax increase if the Government is perceived to be effective at producing good outcomes on a cost-effective basis. It is far more difficult for taxpayers to buy into a government system that is not delivering good outcomes or is wasteful in its spending. Both the reality and taxpayer perception of reality are important, and it appears that at the present point in time both are issues for the previous Government. Comment The proposals were introduced with the objectives of improving the fairness of the tax system and raising revenue for Budget 2023. Decisions regarding the use of revenue raised and government expenditure generally are outside the scope of the Bill and are a matter for the Government of the day. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Collaboration with investor groups needed Submission (NZ Shareholders’ Association, Securities Industry Association and NZX Ltd) Parliament seems intent on perpetuating a bias against individual investors. The proposals are a further “nail in the coffin” for representation of individual investors in tax structures and government policies. There is already a significant lack of representation within Parliament for the interests of individual investors. Over recent years, the manner of investment Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 160 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] opportunities for retail investors have increased dramatically, to include structures such as PIEs, discretionary investment managed services (DIMS), and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in addition to new investment platforms such as Sharesies. We propose a more collaborative approach with investor groups, including the NZ Shareholders’ Association, to support the Select Committee in pursuing effective representation for individual investors. Comment Officials acknowledge the importance of public consultation and the valuable role that external stakeholders have in policy development. New Zealand’s GTPP has been in place since 1994 to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. In most cases, officials would recommend that tax policy proposals are developed under the GTPP. However, Budget proposals rarely go through public consultation due to Budget sensitivity. Engagement between the Select Committee and investor groups is not a matter for officials to comment on. It is a matter for the Select Committee to consider. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Deemed settlor rule Submission (C Macalister) The $25,000 deemed settlor rule in section HC 27 of the ITA should either be repealed, treated as applying for the following income year, or increased to remove its inadvertent application. This rule is often either overlooked or misunderstood. In many cases, people are not aware of deemed settlor implications until after the end of the income year when the trust accounts are prepared. This can affect eligibility for state assistance. Comment The definition of a “settlor” in section YA 1 of the ITA is broad, and includes a person, who, at any time, transfers value to a trust, for the benefit of the trust, or on terms of the trust. This definition includes a beneficiary who is owed money by the trustee. The $25,000 threshold in Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 161 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] section HC 27 is a taxpayer-friendly provision to ensure that beneficiaries that are owed $25,000 or less by the trustee are not automatically deemed to be a settlor of the trust. Increasing the $25,000 threshold or amending the treatment of this rule is outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. Any work on this matter would be subject to prioritisation on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Aligning New Zealand’s tax rules with other common law jurisdictions Submission (C Macalister) New Zealand should align its tax rules with those of other common law jurisdictions. Changing the trustee tax rate is a broad policy decision that has implications across the trust rules. New Zealand’s settlor regime (which ensures the worldwide income of a trust is treated as taxable to the trustees in New Zealand if a settlor was a New Zealand tax resident or died a New Zealand tax resident) has not been followed by other common law jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions have instead taken the approach of treating trusts as tax resident based on the tax residence of the trustees. The different approaches taken have led to tax avoidance opportunities for non-residents establishing foreign trusts with New Zealand-based trustees. The introduction of disclosure rules for foreign trusts may have had some success in addressing this but has also resulted in higher compliance costs. Aligning New Zealand’s trust rules with other common-law jurisdictions also has advantages for cross-border income and the application of double taxation agreements. Comment Departing from New Zealand’s settlor-based trust tax regime would be a significant policy change and outside the scope of the proposals in the Bill. We do not recommend making fundamental changes to the taxation of trusts without undertaking public consultation. Further consideration of this matter would be subject to prioritisation by Minister’s on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Clauses 57(2), 59(19) and 62(5) Issue: Retrospectivity of proposed changes Submission (Associate Professor Hanna Wilberg, Baucher Consulting Ltd, Community Law Centres Aotearoa, Devika Dhir, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, EY, International Tax Specialists New Zealand Ltd, Sefton Pryce, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Some submitters note that due to some reviewed sanctions by MSD in the Social Security Act 1964 since 2019, many backdated payments were made to correct any injustice resulting from these sanctions. These recipients therefore had to pay tax on lump sum payments that were made because of government error. Submitters noted that they would like to see all proposed changes, but at least the MSD lump sum backdated payments, made retrospective. (Associate Professor Hanna Wilberg, Community Law Centres Aotearoa, Devika Dhir, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Some submitters note that the proposed application date of 1 April 2024 will not apply to the lump sum payments made in the 2024 tax year, which is the year the Bill was introduced. The submitters suggest that the proposed changes should apply to the tax year in which Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 166 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] they were announced, from either the start of the income year or from the date of introduction of the Bill. It is recommended this could be done through a square up as part of a recipient’s 2024 tax return. (Baucher Consulting Ltd, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Other submitters note that all proposed changes should be made retrospective with no suggested period. (EY, International Tax Specialists New Zealand Ltd, Sefton Pryce) Comment Officials consider there is no clear basis to make the proposed changes retrospective because the proposed changes do not meet all the usual requirements for a policy to be made retrospective. These requirements include confirming a long-standing policy intent or correcting a clear error in the legislation. The law around these payments is clear and reflects the historic policy intent of the taxation of those payments, so the criteria that there is some uncertainty in the application of the rules or the law is contrary to the policy intent is not met. If the change was made retrospectively, there will always be an arbitrary line where some people are taxed under the new rules and some will lose out only because they were paid the day before the retrospective application date. This could only be avoided by going back to when ACC was formed in 1974, which is not feasible. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Clauses 57(1) and 59(15) Issue: Backdated lump sum payments for attendant care Submission (Action to Improve Maternity, New Zealand Law Society, Office of the Ombudsman) The current drafting does not explicitly capture all cases intended to be captured by the proposed amendments. Specifically, the proposed amendments should be extended to address the tax treatment of backdated lump sum payments for attendant care to reduce the inequities that affect those who provide care for ACC claimants. As the proposed legislation currently reads, family members or caregivers who are entitled to receive retrospective attendant care payments will be taxed at their current year’s tax rate. This creates an unfair outcome for people who were intended to be captured under the proposed changes. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 167 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials agree that the proposed changes were intended to cover these payments and a drafting issue has meant these payments were not included in the Bill. Amendments should be made to the proposed changes to include backdated lump sum payments for attendant care. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Clause 57(1) Issue: Impact of ACC and MSD lump sum payments on Working for Families Tax Credits Submission (Associate Professor Hanna Wilberg, Community Law Centres Aotearoa, Devika Dhir, Tax Justice Aotearoa) Submitters note that under the proposed amendments, when a person receives their backdated lump sum payment, the payment will be included in the person’s family scheme income, which is used to calculate the Working for Families (WFF) entitlement. In the year when the person receives their backdated lump sum payment, their entitlement for WFF tax credits may subsequently decrease, which submitters perceive as an unfair outcome. The recipient may also experience WFF-related clawbacks as a result of the receipt of their backdated lump sum payment. Comment Backdated payments are considered family scheme income for WFF and other social policy obligations (including student loans). The effect on a person’s current year entitlement is the flow on consequence of receiving a lump sum. These obligations usually depend on how much cash a person has available, not what their taxable income is, and if a person receives a lump sum there is an expectation that the cash can be used to meet or repay those obligations. In terms of social policy obligations and WFF, the receipt of a lump sum generally means that someone who has previously received too much WFF should repay some of that overpayment. This is on the basis that if the person had received the lump sum over the period when it should have been paid, they would have received less WFF. An exception to Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 168 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] this general rule is those who are receiving a full WFF entitlement, and the amounts received would not have reduced this. Income support, however, looks at all the resources a person has available, and when someone receives a lump sum payment, they then have resources available to meet those obligations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 57(1) Issue: Backdated lump sum payments of foreign social security pensions Submission (International Tax Specialists New Zealand Ltd) The submitter proposed that the scope of the policy be amended to include backdated lump sum foreign social security pensions received by New Zealand tax residents who are also in receipt of New Zealand superannuation. When the recipients receive their backdated lump sum social security payments, it is deducted from their future New Zealand superannuation payments. Comment Officials do not believe that backdated lump sum payments of foreign social security pensions meet the criteria of the policy. It is considered that these lump sum payments arise due to a “fault” by the foreign government and not the New Zealand Government. This policy aims at addressing unfair tax treatment that arose because of a backdated lump sum payment that was made due to an error of the New Zealand Government. Even if these payments fell within the criteria of the policy, the definition of these payments could also be problematic because they are not facilitated by the New Zealand Government and are paid by multiple different overseas governments. It would be complex to set out a definition that captures the intended payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 169 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 57(1) Issue: Extend proposals to apply to redundancy payments Submission (Baucher Consulting Ltd) The submitter proposed that the amendments be extended to apply to redundancy payments. Comment While redundancy payments may be seen to be related to previous years, the person is only entitled to the payment once they are made redundant, which occurs in the year of receipt of the payment. Although a redundancy payment is calculated with reference to the person’s earnings in prior periods, this is just a basis of calculation and the payment itself does not relate to those prior years. Officials consider that redundancy payments should not be included in the proposed changes because they are paid pursuant to provisions set out in an employment contract and do not relate to an entitlement that should have been paid in previous years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 57(1) Issue: Including the amount of the lump sum in the tax rate calculation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) It was proposed that the formula used to calculate the lump sum recipient’s average tax rate be revised so that it takes the amount of the backdated lump sum payment into account when calculating the tax rate to apply to the backdated lump sum payment because the current proposed calculation may result in under-taxation. Comment The policy has been designed to tax a backdated lump sum payment at the person’s usual tax rate (or an approximation of that). Including the backdated lump sum payment in that Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 170 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] calculation would result in a higher rate that could push the recipient into a higher than usual tax bracket, which could result in unfair outcomes. While the proposal could result in the under-taxation of the backdated lump sum payment in some cases, we consider these to be limited given the way the average tax rate is proposed to be calculated. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 57(1) Issue: Support for information sharing provision Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter notes support for the proposed policy that will allow existing information sharing provisions to be utilised when a request for a recipient’s tax rate is made to calculate the applicable tax rate for the backdated lump sum payment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Education campaign in MyIR Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter recommends that Inland Revenue undertake an education campaign in MyIR that shows taxpayers how the proposed changes work, including the calculation of the tax rate for a recipient’s backdated lump sum payment. Comment The technical details of how the proposal will be implemented within Inland Revenue’s systems is still being worked through. However, any calculations or adjustments will be clear in a recipient’s MyIR account. The proposed change will also be supported by guidance on Inland Revenue’s website and through our usual channels such as the Tax Information Bulletin. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 171 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 57(1) Issue: Tax on the lump sum payment should be a final tax Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter notes that the proposed rules do not consider cases where the information provided to Inland Revenue by a backdated lump sum recipient is not correct. This could result in a situation where a recipient may be under-taxed on their lump sum payment and have a tax liability with Inland Revenue. The submitter proposes that the tax deducted by ACC, as determined by the tax rate calculated by Inland Revenue, should be a final tax except when ACC has deducted too much tax on a backdated lump sum payment. Comment Inland Revenue provides ACC with a withholding tax rate based on the recipient’s average tax rate, so officials consider that in most cases there should be no, or minimal, square up for most recipients. However, where Inland Revenue does not have full information for prior years or the person has a significant change in circumstances in the year of receipt, there may still be under- or over-taxation that will result in a square up at year end. There is no way to determine the correct tax rate that the payment will be ultimately subject to because Inland Revenue may not have full information, particularly for the year of receipt of the backdated lump sum payment. However, by using an average rate, officials consider the number of cases resulting in under- or over-taxation will be small. These will generally be restricted to cases where a significant change in circumstances for the person has occurred or where Inland Revenue does not hold full information for the prior four years and there is a missing outlier year. We consider that using the withholding rate as a final tax will, in most cases, work out correctly. In limited outlier cases it may result in under- or over-taxation and a wash-up calculation will address this without creating issues for the majority of recipients given the calculation will be automatically done by Inland Revenue as part of the annual tax assessment process.

Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Guidance on the implication for tax return data points Submission (Digital Service Providers Australia New Zealand) The submitter notes that when proposed changes are likely to directly impact the tax return data points of potentially impacted individuals, the Bill commentary should address how the proposed changes will be implemented in Inland Revenue systems. Comment Although the guidance on how the proposed changes will be implemented was not included in the Bill commentary, Inland Revenue operational teams will engage with digital services providers if changes are made that are likely to impact the providers. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 173 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 57(1) Issue: Extend proposals to cover certain other payments Submission (KPMG) The submitter notes that a similar situation can occur with other lump sum payments. Due to non-compliance with the Holidays Act 2003, a lump sum payment that can relate to multiple tax years may arise. This issue can affect both the public and private sector. The submitter states that the payments that have arisen from employers’ issues with the Holidays Act 2003 are mostly due to the complexity of applying the Act in current payroll environments. The recipient of the lump sum payment may experience over-taxation on receipt of the lump sum payment and should therefore be able to apply the same calculation that is proposed for ACC backdated lump sum payments. The submitter also notes that the proposed changes should be extended to any other lump sum payments that relate to two or more years and relates to a specified event. Comment Although there may be many people who are likely to receive lump sum payments due to their employer’s non-compliance with the Holidays Act 2003, discussions officials have had with a number of large public sector employees indicates that the average amount paid out is not likely to have a significant impact on the tax liability of the recipient. Inland Revenue has also not experienced a large number of complaints relating to these types of payments pushing recipients on to a higher tax rate. While officials recognise this could occur at the margins and for outlier cases, we have not seen evidence that this is a widespread issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 174 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 57(1) Issue: Consideration of other lump sum payments Submission (Office of the Ombudsman, OliverShaw Ltd) Submitters noted that other backdated lump sum payments that might fall within scope of this policy should be considered by the Select Committee or as part of the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 57(1) Issue: There should be no time limit on ACC backdated lump sum payments Submission (David Reddell) The submitter notes that there should not be a maximum period of four years for the proposed tax treatment to apply to a backdated lump sum payment because these payments differ in the length of time they address due to each individual’s unique circumstances. The submitter also notes that applying a 10.5%, or higher, tax rate to ACC backdated lump sum payments is not fair because the recipient has already paid PAYE on the payments in prior years. Comment The policy does not limit the period of the backdated lump sum payment so that only a portion of the lump sum is treated with the new proposed tax treatment. The entire payment will be subject to the new rules no matter what period the payment relates to. The four-year period is only used to calculate a person’s average tax rate to apply to the payment. The average tax rate is calculated based on the recipient’s previous four income years. The higher of the calculated average tax rate or 10.5% is then withheld against the entire lump sum amount. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 175 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Tax is withheld from the payment by ACC, and this will be squared up at the end of the year. The payment is not taxed twice. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Suggested changes to non-Inland Revenue Acts Submission (David Reddell) The submitter notes that communication between Crown entities regarding ACC backdated lump sum payments should be improved because the current state can cause unfair outcomes for lump sum recipients, which does not adhere to the meaning of the Acts. The submitter suggested changes to the way that ACC backdated lump sum payments are treated when a product administered by MSD is also involved. Comment These issues raised are not within the scope of this Bill because they raise issues that are not within the purview of the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted.

(New Zealand Council of Trade Unions)  The payment of an employer KiwiSaver contribution to eligible paid parental leave (PPL) recipients by the government is a small but positive step towards helping improve the retirement savings of women, which on average are 20% lower than men. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  There is a need to address the gender inequity in KiwiSaver balances. The proposed government contribution provides an additional incentive for employees to make KiwiSaver contributions while on PPL beyond the existing incentive of saving for retirement. (EY)  Support for the proposal because breaks in superannuation payments during parental leave contribute to women having lower levels of retirement savings than men. (Tax Justice Aotearoa) Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: KiwiSaver member must contribute to receive proposed government contribution Submission (EY, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Tax Justice Aotearoa, University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity)  The lack of incentive may not be the primary factor in caregivers pausing KiwiSaver contributions while receiving PPL payments, but rather unaffordability. Caregivers with Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 180 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] lower amounts of income may be unable to sacrifice 3% of their PPL payments to access the proposed matching government contribution, meaning the policy has the potential to be regressive. The government contribution should apply regardless of whether the PPL recipient also contributes 3% of their PPL payments to their KiwiSaver accounts. (EY)  The efficacy of this proposal is somewhat undermined by the fact that the government payment is conditional on the recipient also paying 3% into their KiwiSaver account over the PPL period. This is expected to limit the reach of the proposed change because some people on PPL have to suspend their KiwiSaver contributions due to material hardship. This conditionality should be removed so that all recipients of PPL are eligible to receive the 3% government contribution regardless of whether they are also contributing during their time on PPL. ( New Zealand Council of Trade Unions)  The benefit of this proposal will disproportionately accrue to higher income households who are able to afford KiwiSaver contributions while on PPL, while doing little about the fundamental problems of the majority of women who take time out to look after children. (University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity)  The proposal will have both limited application and increase the gap between people in different financial situations. (Tax Justice Aotearoa) Comment While the benefit of the proposal will accrue to those who are financially able to contribute to their KiwiSaver accounts, the “coupling” (or conditionality) of employer and employee KiwiSaver contributions is a long-standing feature of KiwiSaver that has been present since the scheme’s inception. Accordingly, given constraints of time, officials recommended design choices that would align with existing KiwiSaver settings. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New Zealand’s PPL provisions should be reconsidered Submission (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, Tania A, Tax Justice Aotearoa, University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity)  The policy reinforces the advantages of paid work over the value of caregiving because only those with a paid work connection will qualify for the state funded top-up, or PPL itself. (University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 181 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  There needs to be a fuller debate about effective KiwiSaver policies to make a real difference for women. Acknowledgement of unpaid caregiving requires substantial policy debate. (University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity)  Women would be assisted in a more meaningful way if the employer contribution was mandatory for all KiwiSaver members, regardless of whether they are on a suspensions holiday. The tax Bill should revisit the current proposal. (University of Auckland Economic Policy Centre – Pensions and Intergenerational Equity)  There needs to be a fundamental rethink of how PPL is done in this country. New Zealand’s PPL provisions are weak compared to many other wealthy countries. In particular: o The number of weeks of PPL should be significantly increased, as should the weekly payment maximum (which is currently set well below the minimum wage). o Setting PPL rates at the living wage would ensure a more appropriate level of support and help to alleviate the financial burden of parenthood and the wage scarring that disproportionately affects women. (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions)  PPL should be increased to a higher and more realistically liveable rate, such as the living wage. (Tax Justice Aotearoa)  Analysis should be requested into whether these payments should be available to a wider range of people than those who take parental leave (for example, those who may need to stop paid work to look after dependants, those who are on unpaid parental leave and other people who may be unable to continue their KiwiSaver contributions. (Tax Justice Aotearoa)  The proposal should also be applied to those who receive ACC weekly workers’ compensation who can’t be employed due to lifelong disabilities. (Tania A) Comment Officials note submitters’ comments on the possibility of expanding the scope of the proposal and redesigning existing PPL settings. However, any additional policy changes would need to be commissioned and resourced across the responsible agencies by the government. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 182 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] TAXATION ROLLOVER RELIEF Clauses 18B, 21B, 23 and 27 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Federated Farmers, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd, PwC, Taxpayers’ Union) The submitters support the proposal to provide the option of taxation rollover relief when an insurance pay-out on North Island flood damaged property results in either profits arising on revenue account property or depreciation clawback on depreciable property. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Federated Farmers, PwC) Support for the proposal, subject to suggested amendments. (Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) Recommendation That the support be noted. Issue: Proposal should be made generic Submission (Federated Farmers, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) This proposal should be made generic, rather than event driven, when there are insurance claims based on replacement cost rather than indemnity value. Comment Taxation rollover relief involves special treatment because any gains on disposal are carried forward to the replacement asset. While we do not generally recommend using the tax system to incentivise behaviour, in this case to rebuild/replace the asset, we acknowledge that the scale of major natural events can warrant this special treatment. As with the Canterbury and Hurunui-Kaikoura earthquakes, the flood events were unexpected, and the rollover relief is intended to simply put the business back into a similar tax position as if the events had not occurred. Officials acknowledge that there seems to be an increasing number of serious weather- related and other emergency events. This has led to calls for a more streamlined process for handling the tax response rather than through specific legislation for each event. Currently, Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 183 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] reliance is placed on there being either a tax Bill already in the House or due to be introduced and enacted over the coming year. There may also be a wider policy question, as noted in the submission, about whether rollover treatment should be applied more widely when there are insurance pay-outs, not just in specific event situations. Officials have noted on previous occasions that if it was undesirable for the Government to receive tax from depreciation recovered on assets destroyed by wide-scale events such as earthquakes, it could be worth considering why the law currently provides for such gains to be taxed on isolated events, such as a factory fire. The feasibility of considering these issues would need to be assessed against other priorities on the Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. If there is scope, focus would initially be on streamlining the legislative process for the tax measures needed in the immediate response period to an emergency weather event. For example, a certain level of employer provided ex- gratia payments and fringe benefits could be made exempt from income tax through an Order in Council rather than having to await the passage of a tax Bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Widen proposal to accommodate buy-outs by central and local government Submission (Federated Farmers, Jim Gordon Tax Ltd) The proposal needs to be widened to accommodate buy-outs by local or central government. Comment Since the draft legislation was introduced in May, the Government has announced funding to assist local governments in their purchase of certain flood and cyclone affected residential properties. Most of these properties will have a category 3 rating, which means that it is ultimately unsafe to re-occupy them even with repairs. The legislation is currently focused on revenue gains or depreciation recovery income arising from an insurance pay-out. An insurance pay-out does not result in a disposal for tax purposes, but the outcome is comparable. A local government or Crown buy-out will result in a disposal and, therefore, the taxation rollover provisions need to also apply to gains or depreciation recovery income arising from a buy-out. This situation would be most relevant Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 184 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] for owners of rented residential property that has been seriously affected by the flood and cyclone events covered by the buy-outs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Turn off bright-line and other timing tests Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Jim Gordon Ltd) The 5- and 10-year bright-line tests need to be turned off for buy-outs by local or central government. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Although most residential property owners will be excluded from the application of these tests by the main home exclusion, it is possible that they could apply to owners of residential rental property if it had not been owned for the relevant minimum period. The Government has, therefore, introduced amendments to turn off the bright-line tests and other similar land-based timing tests for buy-out situations relating to the Auckland floods and Cyclone Gabrielle, through Supplementary Order Paper No 423 introduced on 6 September 2023. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that it be noted that this issue has been addressed by Supplementary Order Paper No 423. Issue: Extend rollover relief to land improvements Submission (PwC) The taxation rollover relief proposal should be extended to cover land improvements covered by sections DO 4 and DO 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (land improvements, trees and vines) because taxpayers may receive insurance proceeds that cover these destroyed assets. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 185 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials agree with the submission. Section DO 4 covers a range of land improvements, including support frames for crops, access roads and tracks, dams, stop-banks and vineyard vines. Section DO 5 covers horticultural plants such as apple trees. In both cases, expenditure on such assets is amortised over their respective expected lives, in a similar way that other assets are depreciated. There may be cases where the taxpayer receives an insurance pay-out for a land improvement covered by either section. If the insurance pay-out exceeds the residual tax value of the assets, then the equivalent of depreciation recovery income arises to the extent that an expenditure deduction has been previously claimed for the asset. Although it is not intended that an amortised asset should be subject to the equivalent of depreciation clawback, and that is the case if the asset is disposed of, clawback can arise when an insurance pay-out is received. Given the unexpected nature of the income, it should at least be subject to deferral through the rollover relief option, as suggested by the submitter, provided the asset is replaced. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Add June 2023 East Coast floods to events covered by rollover relief Submission (Federated Farmers, Jim Gordon Ltd) The East Coast floods in late June should also be incorporated in the events covered by the proposed rollover relief because the combined effects of the events exacerbated the damage. Such events may be covered by the current definition in the Bill but the submitters would prefer it to be put beyond doubt through an amendment. Alternatively, they would accept an officials’ statement in their advice to the Committee. Comment Officials do not consider that it is necessary to add the June 2023 East Coast flood events to the list of eligible events. However, officials are willing to provide a statement that the events are covered by the current definition. The proposed definition in the Bill is: Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 186 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] North Island flooding events— (a) means flooding and other damage that occurred in an affected area caused by any of the following weather events: (i) Cyclone Hale, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 8 January 2023 and ending on 12 January 2023: (ii) heavy rainfall commencing on 26 January 2023 and ending on 3 February 2023 in the Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty regions: (iii) Cyclone Gabrielle, which crossed the North Island of New Zealand during the period commencing on 12 February 2023 and ending on 16 February 2023; and (b) includes circumstances where damage caused by any of the events listed in paragraph (a) is exacerbated by a subsequent weather event. Paragraph (b) is intended to provide for situations such as the June 2023 events, which exacerbate the damage from the earlier events. Recommendation That the submission and officials’ statement be noted. Issue: Add Nelson flood event buy-outs Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Nelson floods should be added to the list of events covered by the turning off of the bright-line and other timing tests. Comment Since Supplementary Order Paper No 423 was prepared, the Government has announced a support package to help towards funding the Nelson City Council’s buy-out of properties impacted by the floods of August 2022. We understand this will involve 14 properties. Given the possibility that some of these residential properties may be rented rather than owner- occupied (and therefore covered by the main home exclusion), the bright-line or other timing tests could apply in such cases. The proposed provision turning off the tests for buy- outs of North Island flood affected properties should, therefore, be extended to include the Nelson event. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 187 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: CA ANZ support for other proposals Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) a. Supports proposal on assets uneconomic to repair. b. Supports proposal to cap depreciation recovery income on repairable assets. c. Supports proposal to allow depreciation on assets where access is temporarily restricted. d. Supports optional timing rules for when to recognise income and deductions relating to both flood or cyclone damaged assets. This helps to reduce compliance costs. e. Supports the thin capitalisation proposal, but likely to be rarely used. f. Supports the definitions of “affected area” and “North Island flooding events”. Comment a. Proposed section EZ 83 will ensure that owners of assets that are uneconomic to repair can also elect to use rollover relief for such assets, putting them on par with assets that have been destroyed. b. Proposed section EZ 84 caps the amount of depreciation recovery income on a flood or cyclone damaged asset at the lesser of the amount of depreciation recovery income or the total amount of depreciation loss. c. Proposed section EZ 85 allows deductions for expenditure on assets when access to the asset is temporarily restricted. An example would be when the property has been red stickered, and machinery in the business premises cannot, therefore, be used to generate income. d. Proposed sections EZ 86 and EZ 87 provide optional alternative timing rules on when repair/replacement expenditure is incurred, and insurance income is received. These rules are designed to provide additional flexibility, in line with accounting practice. e. Proposed section FZ 7B provides the option of early recognition of insurance receipts for thin capitalisation purposes. Including the receipts in thin capitalisation calculations in effect replicates the asset position in the absence of the emergency event, so that interest deductions are not impacted. f. Clause 59(3) and (13) proposes to amend section YA 1 to ensure that the events and areas affected are consistent with other recovery legislation, including the Severe Weather Emergency Recovery Legislation Act 2023. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 188 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Recognising expenditure deductions for suspended activities Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Proposed section EZ 85, relating to expenditure deductions when an income earning activity is temporarily suspended, should be modified to allow deductions in the year the expenditure is incurred rather than when the activity is resumed. Comment The purpose of proposed section EZ 85 is to ensure that expenditure incurred when an income earning activity is suspended because of a North Island flooding event, can nevertheless be deducted. The deduction is timed for the year of activity resumption to avoid situations when deductions are taken but no income earning activity resumes because the business is ultimately considered unviable. That possibility may be less relevant if the business has other premises, such as orchards in various locations, from which it can operate in the meantime. Overall, however, officials consider that allocating the deductions to the year of resumed activity remains appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Rollover relief election process must be electronic and as simple as possible Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The rollover relief election process must be electronic and as simple as possible. It needs to be a simpler process than for the Canterbury earthquakes. This includes providing information only on a request basis. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 189 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Proposed sections CZ 25C and EZ 23BE outline the notice requirements for a taxpayer who elects rollover relief. These have been modelled on the requirements that applied for previous emergency events. For example, proposed section EZ 23BE requires the taxpayer to give notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue specifying the affected property and linking each item of replacement property with an affected class of depreciable property. This notice must be given when the income tax return is filed for the income year in which the insurance pay-out can be reasonably estimated. Notice must also be given in each subsequent year in which the depreciation recovery income is suspended, and an update provided on the rebuild/replacement. This level of detail is required because of the different types of depreciable assets and the need to link the replacement asset with the same class. It also ensures that the taxpayer turns their mind to the issue annually, including whether they are still intending to replace the asset. While we consider that it is still necessary to require notification of an election and to provide annual information to ensure parties turn their minds to the issue annually, we want to ensure that this process is as streamlined as possible. We agree with the submission that the notification information should be able to be provided electronically. That option was not readily available for the Canterbury earthquakes but is available for the current events. MyIR enables documents to be sent electronically as secure webmail and with any required attachment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Recognising late rollover elections Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The Commissioner of I nland Revenue should have a wider discretion to accept a late election than just “exceptional circumstances”. Comment Acceptance of late elections was an issue for the Canterbury earthquakes given the lack of flexibility around the Commissioner being able to accept such elections when they were received after the required cut-off date. The cut-off date for an election is the date for filing the relevant income tax return. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 190 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] To address this concern, the relevant proposed provisions in the Bill provide flexibility through the Commissioner having the power to accept late elections in exceptional circumstances. This discretion is intended to cover situations beyond the control of the taxpayer or their agent, such as an election being delayed because the taxpayer’s agent posted it. There is a need to balance limiting the breadth of the discretion against creating too much uncertainty because the discretion is open-ended. Relatively open-ended discretions were provided in previous tax Acts but many were removed as part of the rewrite process because of the uncertainty and inconsistency that they could create. Overall, officials consider that “exceptional circumstances” is sufficient to accommodate most unusual situations likely to arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remove requirement to assess asset as uneconomic to repair Submission (PwC) Proposed section EZ 83 applies to assets that are uneconomic to repair, as assessed by the payer of the insurance or compensation, or another qualified assessor. We recommend that consideration be given to removing the requirement for the payer of insurance or qualified assessor to assess the item as uneconomic to repair. The parties are more inclined to reach a practical settlement where a claim is significant. Comment During discussions with key stakeholder groups on the proposed provisions, we received feedback that insurers were often reluctant to provide an assessment that an asset is uneconomic to repair, and that the legislation should, therefore, provide for alternative assessors. We took this advice on board and added the reference to “or another qualified assessor”. Our view was that an independent assessment on this point was important because leaving taxpayers to simply make their own assessment of whether an asset is uneconomic to repair could lead to inconsistency and unintended tax deferral opportunities. The proposed provision would still enable the insurer and asset owner to reach a practical settlement. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 191 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Point of difference The submitter’s concern is that the asset owner may still not be able to find a person to provide such an assessment and would not, therefore, technically meet the requirements of the provision despite having an asset that was not economic to repair. On balance, while an assessment is important, we agree that requiring businesses to obtain an independent assessment could be a technical impediment and that the business itself can be relied on to make such an assessment. We, therefore, instead recommend that the provision refer to the item being reasonably assessed by the business as uneconomic to repair. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Assets available for use but inaccessible Submission (PwC) Assets that are irreparably damaged and assets that are uneconomic to repair as a result of the North Island flooding event should be treated consistently. Further, we submit that taxpayers should be entitled to continue to depreciate both categories of assets following the event in line with the policy of preventing windfall gains to the Government. Comment The submission seems to be based on a misunderstanding that proposed section EZ 85 extends to irreparably damaged assets. Instead, the provision applies only to assets that would be available for use but for the access restriction, which would exclude assets that are irreparably damaged. More generally, however, the proposed amendments already endeavour to treat assets that are uneconomic to repair comparably to assets that are irreparably damaged for the purposes of the rollover rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 192 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Amend general insurance provisions to exclude uneconomic to repair assets Submission (PwC) We suggest that section EE 52 be amended to exclude assets that are uneconomic to repair. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission. Section EE 52 applies to depreciation recovery income when compensation is received, but specifically excludes assets that have been irreparably damaged. If the amount of insurance or compensation exceeds the amount of expenditure that the person incurs on repairing the asset because of the event, then that excess is deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset. If this results in a negative amount, then that amount is depreciation recovery income. This seems a reasonable approach because it recognises that the person has in effect received back part of the original purchase price of the asset. Proposed section EZ 83 will override section EE 52, to ensure that owners of assets that are uneconomic to repair can also elect to use rollover relief for such assets, putting those assets on par with assets that are irreparably damaged. The submission suggests going further, by removing assets that are uneconomic to repair from the treatment in section EE 52 on an ongoing basis, not just for the North Island flooding events. The matter is out of scope of this Bill and would be more appropriately considered in any future general review of the insurance provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Apportionment of global insurance pay-out Submission (PwC) We submit that the Bill should be updated to reflect the position that insurance proceeds received under a global insurance settlement should be apportioned across the relevant insured assets on a fair and reasonable basis. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 193 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials do not agree with the submission. The tax legislation does not provide specific rules for all situations and reliance on accounting concepts is common in the absence of specific tax legislation. This means that although the tax legislation does provide apportionment rules for some situations, for others, reliance on apportionment on a fair and reasonable basis can be appropriate. We do not consider that the legislation needs to be so prescriptive on this issue given the common practice outlined in the submission. There is no indication that taxpayers will be so uncertain as to what to do to justify additional legislation on this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Thin capitalisation rule Submission (PwC) Proposed section FZ 7B(4)(b) requires taxpayers to give notice to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of the amount of income that would have arisen under the thin capitalisation rules in the absence of proposed section FZ 7B. We submit that paragraph (b) should be removed, for compliance cost reasons, and the Commissioner could instead request this information (under section FZ 7B(4)(d)) only where it is necessary. Comment Officials do not agree that paragraph (b) should be removed. The thin capitalisation rules restrict the amount of interest that a New Zealand company or branch controlled by a non- resident can deduct for New Zealand tax purposes, as part of ensuring a fair share of the company's income is taxed in New Zealand. A company could otherwise have excessive debt in order to transfer profits to an overseas parent. Proposed section FZ 7B provides the option of early recognition of insurance receipts for thin capitalisation purposes. Including the receipts in thin capitalisation calculations in effect replicates the asset position in the absence of the emergency event, so that taxpayers are not restricted by the flooding events in the amount of interest that they can deduct. Paragraph (b) simply provides the Commissioner with some information on the income adjustment. The section FZ 7B option is likely to be used by very few taxpayers, and they will be sizeable businesses. Requiring those taxpayers to provide information on the amount of additional Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 194 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] income that would otherwise have arisen in the absence of the election, does not seem onerous or compliance intensive because the companies would likely want to know that information for their own purposes. This information was required for the Canterbury earthquakes. Point of difference Rather than remove paragraph (b) as recommended by the submitter, officials suggest that the paragraph be modified to simply require a reasonable estimate of the income. This modification should address the submitter’s concerns that a precise measurement of the income would be onerous in the circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Amend latest date for providing election for 2022–23 income year Submission (Matter raised by officials) The latest date for providing Inland Revenue with a rollover election for the first income year (2022–23) should be amended to 30 April 2024. Comment If a taxpayer opts for taxation rollover relief in relation to income arising in the 2022–23 income year, they must provide notification of their election to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by the later of 31 January 2024 and the date on which the return of income needs to be filed for that income year (31 March 2024 for taxpayers with tax agents). The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill may not be enacted before March 2024. Therefore, we recommend that the latest date for providing an election notification be amended to 30 April 2024 to provide taxpayers with more time to provide their notification after anticipated enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 195 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 26 Issue: Consultation with the Privacy Commissioner on the provision of personal information Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) It is not clear whether the Privacy Commissioner or the Inland Revenue Privacy Officer were consulted on the information-requiring provisions in clause 26. Comment The Privacy Commissioner has a function to examine proposed legislation that “may affect the privacy of individuals” and which provides for the collection of personal information by a public sector agency. The Privacy Commissioner does not scrutinise every proposed piece of legislation just because it may include a component of information collection. When considering if a proposal may affect an individual’s privacy, they will consider the amount of personal information being collected, whether it’s proportionate and necessary, voluntary or mandatory, where or who that information is being collected from, and whether the collection is unreasonably intrusive. The Bill contains a proposal that would enable businesses whose assets have been destroyed by the 2023 North Island floods/cyclones to elect to defer any income that arises from the destruction of those assets provided the assets are replaced. An example of such income is the recovery of excess depreciation when there is an insurance pay-out. As part of monitoring such elections and ensuring taxpayers turn their minds to replacing the assets, annual information would need to be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as set out in clause 26. The information-requiring power in clause 26 therefore relates to assets used in a business context and is voluntary. If the person wishes to receive rollover relief, then they need to provide a notice to the Commissioner describing the affected property and giving details about any replacement property. The effective administration of this proposal is dependent on this information being voluntarily provided by the taxpayer. The personal information collected is minimal given that the purpose of the clause relates to property. Furthermore, Inland Revenue is already able to ask for this type of information from a taxpayer to verify their tax return under current law. It is also important to note that the information collected will be subject to the strict privacy provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. Similar information requirements were included in provisions that provided for taxation rollover relief for businesses seriously impacted by the Canterbury and Hurunui- Kaikoura earthquakes. For these reasons, we did not consider it necessary to consult the Privacy Commissioner. The Inland Revenue Privacy Officer agrees with the above comments.

Comment Emergency Alliance has been created to provide a single fundraising platform for its eight members. Its members are all charities that themselves are listed in schedule 32. Emergency Alliance is designed to improve efficiencies and remove cost duplication when raising funds to support donation drives to support international emergency responses. It can be viewed as a restructure in the way that Emergency Alliance’s members would typically raise donations individually in response to international emergency events. Emergency Alliance’s purposes are directed towards:  providing for the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster, and  advancing humanitarian aid and development in developing countries. The charity’s purposes are consistent with Cabinet’s approval criteria for granting overseas donee status. Being a restructure of existing arrangements, we recommend Emergency Alliance be included in clause 64 of the Bill. Since the charity made its submission, on 26 October 2023, it has started an urgent appeal in response to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We recommend the change apply from the same date, 26 October 2023, and have application to donations received on and after that date. We have applied the same due diligence work to Emergency Alliance as has been applied to the other additions to schedule 32 set out in clause 64 of the Bill.

Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Benefits for New Zealand economy and revenue take Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter notes the proposal. Extending the exemption should lessen the possibility of offshore non-resident drilling rigs leaving New Zealand before completing exploration work. A significant discovery, and consequential oil and gas production, has the potential to increase economic development activity, and tax and royalty revenue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Opposition to extending the temporary exemption Submission (Tax Justice Aotearoa) The submitter does not support providing this exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig operators. Oil exploration is in the process of being phased out. While there may be an expectation that the tax exemption will be in place for a while yet, the submitter sees no justification for this. The exemption should be removed from the Bill. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 199 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment The tax exemption was introduced in 2004 to address an issue created by New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreements. The agreements provide that operators are only taxable in New Zealand if they are present for at least 183 days. Before the exemption was introduced, rigs and seismic vessels would leave New Zealand waters before the 183-day threshold was reached to avoid being subject to New Zealand tax. This is referred to as churn. If required, another rig or seismic vessel would be mobilised to complete the production or exploration programme. The normal tax rules reduce the tax revenue base because rigs and seismic vessels will churn in and out of New Zealand waters, and the increased costs from churning are deductible to New Zealand petroleum miners. The reduced exploration and production resulting from churn may also lead to lower company taxes, petroleum royalties and other taxes being paid over time. The exemption removes the incentive for rigs and seismic vessels to churn. While New Zealand is attempting to transition from fossil fuels, and will not issue new offshore petroleum exploration permits, there continues to be an offshore petroleum industry and that industry, while it exists, will always be reliant on non-resident rigs and seismic vessels. New Zealand does not have a policy to actively disincentivise, or prevent, petroleum production and even if it was to do so in the future, there would be more efficient measures to achieve this than a policy that inadvertently encourages churn. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

In particular: a. Reference to “paid” pay periods: o The term “paid” should be included within section RD 17(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to better align the intent of the legislation with how extra pay should be taxed in practice. For example, this section could be changed to “the annualised value of the PAYE income payments for the last two paid pay periods before the one containing the extra pay”. o The following definition should be used for “pay period”: “A regularly recurring period of time for which an employee is paid”. Inland Revenue should consult with payroll software providers on the definition used in the legislation. b. Situations where there are not two prior paid pay periods available: o The Bill does not include information on how employers should treat situations where there are not two paid pay periods prior to the pay that contains the extra pay, or where there has been a change in the pay frequency (eg, if an employee has received a sign-on bonus). o The following should be included in the legislation or guidance material: “Where there are no prior paid pay periods before the one which contains the extra pay, the annualised earnings can be calculated by annualising the current pay period earnings”. o Inland Revenue should also provide examples in its guidance where there are not two paid pay periods available.

Reference to “paid” pay periods: Officials note that section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 defines pay period as “for an employee receiving regular payments of salary or wages, means the period for which any such payment is payable”. In officials’ view this, coupled with a requirement to “look back” to prior pay periods, effectively excludes any pay periods for which payment is not owed to an employee. Accordingly, we do not think further legislative amendment is required, but agree that guidance on this issue would be helpful. b. Situations where there are not two prior paid pay periods available: Officials agree this matter should be addressed through guidance (if the proposal should be enacted). Officials intend to continue to work with payroll providers to ensure that an appropriate solution is provided for these. Point of difference The absence of prior pay periods is an existing problem. However, creating a specific rule within the legislation is likely to create unwarranted complexity within payroll software. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application date should be extended Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte)  The application date of 1 April 2024 should be pushed back to 1 April 2025 because the current year is an election year, and the Bill is unlikely to be enacted until early 2024. This does not provide sufficient certainty and time for payroll service providers to make the required changes to their systems once the legislation is enacted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  If this amendment is to proceed, the application date of 1 April 2024 would seem to leave an inadequate period of time for software providers to update systems for the new calculation methodology and limited time to educate the many employers who prepare their own PAYE calculations. (Deloitte) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 205 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Following a further discussion with payroll providers in September 2023 (see Issue: Proposal may not reduce inaccurate taxation b elow), officials agree that allowing additional time for the payroll providers to develop the proposed new rule would be appropriate given the current time constraints. Accordingly, officials recommend that application of the new rule be extended until the 2026 tax year (ie, 1 April 2025–31 March 2026). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Proposal may not reduce inaccurate taxation Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte)  It is not clear that the proposal will help reduce the inaccurate taxation of extra pays received when employment is terminated. Determining the correct PAYE rate is difficult and a person’s tax liability for the year is determined by a number of factors (such as the amount of salary or wages paid by the new employer, whether the person starts a new job immediately or takes a break, whether the person is retiring, etc). (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand)  Although the change is intended to make the taxation of extra pay on termination more accurate, this change does not fully address any inaccuracy. It is not clear this change is necessary given the systems changes that will be required, along with their associated costs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group)  The proposed change will only replace one inaccuracy with another, making it doubtful that this change will result in more accurate tax returns. There is likely to be wide- spread confusion and errors in calculating extra pay tax rates. This change is not limited to extra pays following the termination of employment, but all extra pays (eg, bonuses, gratuities, profit shares, etc). (Deloitte)  Although this may be more accurate in some situations, there are others where this will be inaccurate. For example, when a person is on parental leave and receives a bonus but will continue to be on extended leave. In this situation, the person will be taxed based on the last two paid pay periods, which will be before they were on paid parental leave (PPL), which is unfair. (Deloitte) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 206 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Officials held a further discussion with payroll software providers (the Providers) in early September 2023. During this conversation, the Providers affirmed that the taxation of extra pay arising on the termination of employment creates challenges for both employers and providers. Additionally, the Providers:  Agreed that the proposed solution would likely be more accurate in the taxation of extra pay on termination than the existing rule (which focuses on amounts received over the preceding, arbitrary four-week period).  Noted that applying the proposed solution to all extra pay could create temporary over-taxation in some situations that presently undergo temporary under-taxation but also acknowledged that the tax treatment of such amounts will vary and be heavily fact dependent. An example is the situation given by Deloitte (above), where a bonus is paid while a person is on PPL. The tax treatment would depend on when the bonus is received in relation to the point at which the person ceases working and embarks on PPL. For instance:  Where the person is paid fortnightly and the bonus is received at exactly the point the person embarks on PPL, then the result under the proposed and current rules is likely to be essentially the same.  However, at the other end of the spectrum, where the person has received only PPL payments in the last four weeks, the application of the current rules is likely to result in the bonus being taxed at 10.5%, which (unless the person’s top marginal tax rate is 10.5%) is likely to result in temporary under-taxation, until Inland Revenue provides them with a bill for the amount owing at the end of the current tax year as part of the annual square up. Conversely, the result under the proposed rules could produce temporary over-taxation until the taxpayer receives a refund as part of the annual square up at the end of the tax year. Point of difference Because the proposed change is intended to address the inaccurate taxation of extra pay upon termination of employment, officials recommend that the proposal be applied as a “special rule” to the specific situation of termination of employment, with the current rules to remain in force for other instances of extra pay until solutions are developed that improve accuracy in those cases, too. This means the application of the proposal would be confined to the specific situation where extra pay arises on termination of employment, with the current rules remaining in force for all other situations where extra pay arises. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 207 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ALLOWING DEATH INFORMATION TO BE SHARED WITH KIWISAVER SCHEME PROVIDERS Clause 86 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposal is sensible, because currently a KiwiSaver provider may be unaware of a member’s death and the account can become dormant. Alternatively, executors or administrators may not know the KiwiSaver account exists. The sharing of information will allow KiwiSaver providers to contact executors or administrators of the deceased member’s estate and arrange for the account balance to be paid to the estate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Clause 86 Issue: Consultation with Privacy Commissioner on provision of personal information Submission (Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives) The Committee should ask officials why the Privacy Commissioner was not consulted on clause 86 of the Bill, which allows the sharing of death information with KiwiSaver providers. Comment The Bill proposes allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to communicate information about deceased KiwiSaver members’ estates to KiwiSaver providers so the providers can contact the executors of the deceased member’s estate. This is intended to help with the distribution of assets from the deceased member’s estate to their intended recipients. Generally speaking, the Privacy Act 2020 does not apply to deceased people because the Act protects the rights of “individuals”, defined as a “natural person, other than a deceased natural person”. However, the Act does allow a person’s personal representative to access information about the deceased person. The proposed reform would align with the scheme Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 208 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of the Privacy Act and is not inconsistent with the requirements of that Act, so consultation with the Privacy Commissioner was not required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 209 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] GIFT-EXEMPT BODIES Clause 66(4) Issue: Feedback on proposal Submission (A Muir, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Simpson Grierson, Sue Barker Charities Law) a. Two submitters recommend deleting the proposed amendment in clause 66(4) from the Bill. (A Muir, Sue Barker Charities Law) Sue Barker Charities Law submitted that the proposed amendment to include registered charities within the “gift-exempt body” definition is a duplication of the reporting and monitoring requirements for charities registered under the Charities Act 2005. The “gift-exempt body” definition should be focused on not-for-profit entities that are not registered charities. b. Support for the proposal. (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) c. Generally supportive, accept that updating the definition would be appropriate but suggest that the “gift-exempt body” definition should instead be amended to refer to donee organisations. Given the link between the gift-exempt body provisions in sections 18K, 32 and 58 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) and the donation tax incentive provisions for gifts of money to donee organisations, it is not clear why tax- exempt status or RWT-exempt status should trigger the application of the gift-exempt body provisions in the TAA. (Simpson Grierson) d. The gift-exempt body provisions in the TAA should be clearer in regard to timing issues, such as how long records must be kept under section 32 of the TAA and the timeframe within which the Commissioner may require any return under section 58 of the TAA. (Simpson Grierson) Comment Officials recommend withdrawing this proposal from the Bill to allow any unintended consequences to be worked through. We agree with Simpson Grierson that given the link between the gift-exempt body provisions and the donation tax incentive provisions, the gift- exempt body definition should be linked to donee organisations rather than RWT-exempt status. However, to avoid introducing unintended consequences in relation to record- keeping requirements for gift-exempt bodies, officials will consider this matter over a longer timeframe and for inclusion in a later Bill. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 210 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Simpson Grierson have suggested clarifying how long records should be kept for gift- exempt bodies. We consider that this is addressed by Inland Revenue’s Operational Statement OS 22/04: Charities and Donee Organisations – Part 2 Donee Organisations . The Operational Statement notes that donee organisations must keep records for a minimum of seven years, even if the donee organisation ceases operating (refer to paras 153 to 159). Recommendation a. That the submission be accepted. b. That the submission be noted. c. That the submission be noted. d. That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 211 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DEREGISTRATION TAX Clause 46 Issue: Opposition to proposal Submission (A Muir, Simpson Grierson, Sue Barker Charities Law) Three submitters recommend deleting clause 46 from the Bill. a. It is unreasonable to impose further piecemeal amendments on the charities sector. Any changes should be delayed to conduct a first principles post-implementation review of the Charities Act 2005, including reviewing the definition of charitable purpose. (Sue Barker Charities Law) b. Deregistered charities should not be restricted to transferring assets to a “tax charity” for assets to be excluded from its deregistration tax calculation under section HR 12(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposal would give rise to inappropriate and inequitable outcomes, including: o Precluding a deregistered entity from utilising section HR 12(3)(a) in relation to the transfer of assets to charitable entities that are not registered charities, such as the following types of entities: a charitable entity that is not a registered charity because Charities Act registration is voluntary and the entity may already have tax-exempt status (eg, an amateur sport promotion body), a charitable entity that is not a registered charity because it does not derive material income, or it is a trust that distributes its income to other entities for charitable purposes. (Simpson Grierson) o Requiring charities to transfer assets to a tax charity rather than to individuals distorts the rules, because individuals may be deserving beneficiaries of a charity’s funds, but they cannot be “tax charities”. (Sue Barker Charities Law) c. The current drafting of section HR 12(3)(a) does not raise issues regarding matters falling outside the jurisdiction of any New Zealand authority, unless the transferee is outside New Zealand, as a New Zealand transferee will be within Inland Revenue’s jurisdiction (and potentially the Attorney-General’s jurisdiction, in the case of a transfer for charitable purposes). (Simpson Grierson) d. The existing requirement under section HR 12(3)(a) to transfer assets to another person for charitable purposes, or in accordance with the deregistered entity’s Charities Act registered rules, is sufficient and appropriate. If the clause is not deleted, it should be amended to address the alleged “integrity risk” under the current drafting of section HR 12(3)(a) in a more targeted way, such as by requiring a transfer of assets to a Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 212 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] person in New Zealand and requiring notification of the transfer to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. (Simpson Grierson) e. All tax charities must, by definition, have purposes that are exclusively charitable. This means that the proposed amendment requiring deregistered charities to transfer assets to a tax charity, rather than to “another person”, will render the requirement to transfer assets in accordance with the charity’s rules redundant. (Sue Barker Charities Law) f. If a charity has been deregistered on the basis that its purposes are no longer considered charitable (because Charities Services has taken exception to a particular activity that the charity has undertaken), the charity will not be able to transfer its assets to a “tax charity” in accordance with its rules, because the charitable purposes set out in its rules will suddenly have been found not to be charitable. (Sue Barker Charities Law) Comment a. If an entity has claimed income tax exemptions as a charity and has accumulated assets and income, those assets and income should always be destined for a charitable purpose, even if the entity is deregistered by the New Zealand charity regulator. The deregistration tax is designed to be a disincentive to transfer net assets out of the charitable base once they are settled there. This is achieved by clawing-back tax benefits in certain circumstances when a charity is deregistered. These rules protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring the tax concessions that apply to charities are well-targeted and policy intentions are met. The imposition of tax also ensures deregistered charities are held to account for the assets and income they built up while they enjoyed the benefit of the charitable tax concessions. The current rules provide a carve out from the deregistration tax for assets that, within one year of deregistration, are disposed of or transferred for charitable purposes or in accordance with the entity’s rules contained on the Charities Register. This means that assets can be transferred out of the regulated charitable sector after deregistration. If assets are transferred to an entity with no regulatory oversight, the assets and their accumulated tax benefits may be used for non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes that do not benefit New Zealanders. The ability for assets to be transferred out of the regulated charitable sector undermines the policy intent that assets and income accumulated with the benefit of the charitable income tax exemptions should always remain destined for a charitable purpose. Officials have referred the submitters comments in relation to a review of the Charities Act to the Department of Internal Affairs for its consideration. b. We agree with submitters that the proposal would be an overreach for some deregistered charities that distribute to entities that are not registered charities, but Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 213 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] qualify for an income tax exemption. Officials recommend expanding the proposal to also provide relief from the deregistration tax rules when transfers are made within 12 months of the date of deregistration to registered charities and to New Zealand tax- exempt entities (eg community housing entities and amateur sporting bodies), where the assets will continue to be used for charitable purposes. While this change will mean not all tax benefits are clawed back when assets leave the registered charity sector, it will address the most significant integrity concerns where assets are transferred to overseas entities or to New Zealand entities that do not qualify for a tax exemption. This change will reduce compliance costs for many deregistered charities that transfer their assets to tax-exempt entities. Officials do not agree that assets disposed of in accordance with the entity’s rules (eg by paying employees or funding activities) within 12 months of deregistration should be excluded from the deregistration tax. If the deregistered entity is subject to income tax after deregistration, and it is not subject to regulatory oversight or public reporting, it is appropriate to claw-back tax benefits that had accumulated at the date of deregistration. Officials recommend that the exclusion for the disposal of assets in accordance with the charity’s rules is removed. c. Deregistered charities being able to transfer assets accumulated with the benefit of charitable tax exemptions out of the charitable sector is an issue within the scope of the deregistration tax, not an issue of limited jurisdiction of New Zealand authorities. The proposed amendment is necessary to ensure that the policy intent of the rules is not undermined. d. Amending the proposal to allow the transfer of assets to be to a person in New Zealand (not just to a tax charity) and requiring notification of the transfer to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would not address the integrity risk. Once assets have been transferred to a person, even within New Zealand, that is not subject to the deregistration tax or regulatory oversight, the same risk applies. That is, the transferred assets and their accumulated tax benefits once transferred may be used for non- charitable purposes or charitable purposes that do not benefit New Zealanders, undermining the policy intent of the rules. e. As noted in (b) above, we recommend removing the exclusion for assets to be disposed of in accordance with the deregistered charity’s rules to ensure the assets are not applied for non-charitable purposes. f. Due to the recommended changes in (b) above, a deregistered charity will no longer be required to dispose or transfer its net assets in accordance with its rules in order to be excluded from the deregistration tax. This ensures that a deregistered charity will not be subject to the deregistration tax if it transfers its assets to another tax charity or New Zealand tax-exempt entity for charitable purposes. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 214 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b.

That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter supports the proposal and notes that it will ensure deregistered charities do not benefit from the tax concessions afforded to them while they were a charity. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparenting provision Submission (Simpson Grierson) A grandparenting provision should be introduced. It would not be fair or equitable for an unnecessary and inappropriate substantive change, introduced following no consultation, to apply to arrangements that an entity has already legally committed to or obtained a binding ruling from Inland Revenue regarding such arrangements. (Simpson Grierson) Comment Officials acknowledge that the application date of the proposed amendment could unfairly impact charities that are already in the process of deregistering from the Charities Register. We disagree that a grandparenting provision should be introduced for entities that have obtained a binding ruling from Inland Revenue. Generally, binding rulings are subject to any future legislative changes. Instead, we recommend amending the application date to ensure that the proposal only applies to charities that deregister on or after 1 April 2024. This would remove the retrospective impact of the proposals and ensure that charities that have taken a tax position (ie, deregistered from the Charities Register) before the enactment of the Bill are not affected. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 215 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Point of difference The application date of the proposal should be amended to apply to charities that deregister on or after 1 April 2024. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comment above. Issue: Tax charities Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendment would require the transfer of assets from deregistered charities to be a transfer to a “tax charity” to qualify for the carve out from the deregistration tax. “Tax charity” is defined in section CW 41(5) and includes: a. entities that are registered under the Charities Act 2005 b. entities that have taken reasonable steps towards registering as a charitable entity under the Charities Act or have not been notified by the Commissioner that they are not a tax charity c. non-resident organisations that carry out their charitable purposes outside New Zealand and are an approved tax charity by the Commissioner in situations where registration under the Charities Act is unavailable d. entities that have been removed from the Charities Register until the day on which the entity exhausts all disputes and appeals in relation to its charitable status. Entities that are tax charities under section CW 41(5)(c) should be excluded from the carve out from the deregistration tax to ensure that deregistered charities cannot transfer assets to overseas charities to escape the deregistration tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 216 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] CHARITABLE TRUST DEFINITION Clauses 34, 37, 38, 40, 59(7) and 60 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Simpson Grierson) Simpson Grierson supports the simplification intent of the proposed amendments to the charitable trust definition but submit that the proposal may result in substantive changes.  The changes do not appear to address the position that the definition of a charitable trust in section HC 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) applies in respect of an income year, not a particular point in time.  Further, the changes would remove the standalone requirement under section HC 13(a) for all derived and accumulated income of the trust to be held for charitable purposes, and would remove the requirement under section HC 13(b) that all other applicable prerequisites for exemption under sections CW 41 and CW 42 (not just “tax charity” status) must be met. The submitter suggests that a simpler way of addressing the stated concern that the term “charitable trust” in the ITA is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the term would be to retain and amend section HC 13 to define the term as “tax exempt charitable trust” or “tax charity trust”. Comment The term “charitable trust”, as defined in section HC 13, is used in only a few situations in the ITA. These can be summarised as ensuring that:  settlors of these trusts are not liable as agent of the trustee for income tax payable by the trust (section HC 29)  the deregistration tax applies appropriately (section HC 31(1B)), and  the settlor of the charitable trust and the trust are not associated persons (section YB 8). Officials consider that there should not be any unintended consequences of moving from a definition based on an income year to one based on a point time in time. This is because:  The charitable trust term is used to exclude such trusts from section HC 29. Other exclusions from this section are based on a point in time, not an income year.  The use of the charitable trust term in section HC 31(1B) is based on whether the trust has had a change in circumstances due to failing to meet the requirements to derive Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 217 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] exempt income under section CW 41 or CW 42. This is something that occurs at a point in time rather than an income year.  The associated persons test between a settlor and trustee is also not based on an income year. The charitable trust definition in section HC 13 currently requires all income derived or accumulated to be held for charitable purposes, and it applies on an income year basis. Replacing the charitable trust definition with the tax charity definition will remove the requirement in section HC 13 for all income derived or accumulated to be held for charitable purposes. This change is not expected to have any unintended consequences since all tax charities are required to have charitable purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) Support for the proposal to amend the charitable trust definition. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 218 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] CHARITABLE ENTITIES AND RWT-EXEMPT STATUS Clause 67 Issue: Support for proposal Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Simpson Grierson, Sue Barker Charities Law) The submitters support the proposed amendment to ensure that all charities registered under the Charities Act 2005 are automatically exempt from resident withholding tax for the duration of their registration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 219 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT SOURCE RULE Clause 61 Issue: Support proposed changes to section YD 4(17D) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Support for the proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Section YD 4(17D) should be repealed Submission (PwC) Section YD 4(17D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be repealed because it:  remains unclear what income is captured that is not covered as part of the source rules  will continue to deem income to have a source in New Zealand in unintended circumstances, requiring further remedial changes  is not consistent across New Zealand’s treaty network due to differences in treaty coverage, and  potentially puts residents from treaty jurisdictions within a wider scope of New Zealand tax than residents from non-treaty jurisdictions. Comment Section YD 4(17D) serves a useful general purpose by ensuring that all items of income that New Zealand is entitled to tax under a double tax agreement (DTA) will have a domestic source and therefore be taxable under domestic law (unless excluded or exempt under another domestic provision). This also reduces the risk of double non-taxation. Without the provision, a two-stage inquiry is required to determine if an item of income is taxable in New Zealand. Stage one requires finding a New Zealand source under domestic law, which can be an intensely fact-specific inquiry involving high compliance costs. Stage two requires checking the DTA to determine if New Zealand has taxing rights over the income. The provision simplifies this inquiry by only requiring the second stage. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 220 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] While it’s true that section YD 4(17D) may apply inconsistently across New Zealand’s treaty network due to differences in treaty coverage, most of New Zealand’s DTAs largely conform to New Zealand’s negotiating model. Some degree of difference is inherent in bilateral tax agreements and is therefore unavoidable. However, this inconsistency is not expected to pose a problem for taxpayers in general because they would only need to consult the DTA relevant to their circumstances (not New Zealand’s entire treaty network) to apply section YD 4(17D). Officials acknowledge that section YD 4(17D) has applied in unintended situations (which have necessitated the proposed amendment). Officials are not currently aware of any further unintended situations. However, if they emerge, officials can further consider whether the section should be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section YD 4(17D) should be further narrowed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) Section YD 4(17D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be further narrowed: a. Non-resident directors’ fees should also be carved out of section YD 4(17D). (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) b. The scope of section YD 4(17D) should be narrowed to only include income connected with a permanent establishment (PE) in New Zealand. This will align the DTA source rule with its original problem definition of PE avoidance. (KPMG) Comment Officials do not agree that section YD 4(17D) should be further narrowed in the ways that submitters have suggested. a. It is true that a New Zealand source may exist under section YD 4(17D) when directors’ fees are paid by a New Zealand company to a non-resident in respect of directorship services performed abroad. However, officials do not consider this to be an overreach. Fees paid for being a director of a New Zealand company do have a connection to New Zealand. Even without section YD 4(17D), directors’ fees in such circumstances will often be taxed under section YD 4(4) or (18), because there are special factors for directorship services that diminish the importance normally given to the place of performance (see IS 19/01: Income tax – application of schedular payment rules to non-resident directors’ fees at \[29\]–\[31\]). Whether a New Zealand source exists under Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 221 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] section YD 4(4) and (18) is a question of fact that will turn on the specific factors of each case. In such cases, section YD 4(17D) serves a useful function by clarifying the position and reducing compliance costs, because it removes the need for an intense factual inquiry. b. Officials disagree with the submitter’s suggestion that section YD 4(17D) was intended to address PE avoidance only. The original Bill commentary stated that the intention of section YD 4(17D) was to: ... deem an item of income to have a source in New Zealand if we have a right to tax the item of income under a DTA. Subsection (17D) is intended to ensure that if a DTA applies in respect of an item of income, that item of income will automatically have a New Zealand source. Problems related to PE avoidance are separately addressed by sections GB 54 and YD 4(17C), which were introduced in the same Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. Officials further disagree with the submitters’ suggestion that section YD 4(17C) is limited to “business income” only. As such, officials consider that narrowing section YD 4(17D) to apply only to income connected to a PE would render it redundant and would be akin to repealing the provision altogether. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Definition of “technical services fees” should be clarified Submission (KPMG) The description of “technical services fees” in section YD 4(17D) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is insufficient to cover the breadth of transactions that could be deemed to have a source in New Zealand and therefore subject to overreach. For example, New Zealand’s DTA with Malaysia does not refer to “technical services fees”, but to payments made as consideration for the management, control or supervision of a business or other activity. Comment Officials agree that it is not clear under the current drafting whether the payments referred to under the Malaysia DTA would be included as “technical services fees”. The same issue arises in respect of the Fiji DTA, which includes as royalties “the supply by a resident of a Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 222 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Contracting State of management services in the other Contracting State”. The intention is for such payments to be included in the proposed exception to section YD 4(17D). Officials agree that this should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reference to a “PE outside New Zealand” is not sufficiently clear Submission (KPMG) The definition of a “PE outside New Zealand” is not clear. The domestic PE definition is likely to be different to the definition of a PE in terms of an applicable DTA that is being considered. The PE definition in most of New Zealand’s DTAs is only agreed between Contracting States that are parties to the DTA and not for the purposes of defining when a PE is in a third State. If the intention is that the relevant principles of a PE definition in a particular DTA are to be used to determine when a PE is outside New Zealand and the other contracting State for the purposes of section YD 4(17D) of the Income Tax Act 2007, then this should be made clear in the legislation. Comment In determining whether there is a “PE outside New Zealand”, the principles of the relevant DTA should apply. Officials agree that this could be made clearer in the legislation.

The submitter suggests that the proposed amendment should be used as a case study for examining the Select Committee’s processes, which would allow it to consider what changes if any should be made to its processes. Comment We have no view to express on this matter. It would be something for the legislative branch to consider, for example as part of the Review of Standing Orders process.

Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consistency with income interest calculation Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Additional wording should be added to section EX 46(3)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that, for the purposes of the section EX 50(4) income interest calculation, it is clear the relevant period is the period during which the person has rights in the foreign investment fund (FIF), rather than the entire accounting period. Comment The proposed amendment to section EX 46(3)(a) mirrors an earlier remedial amendment to section EX 35(a) to address the same concern around access to the 10% income interest test. Section EX 35(a) also refers to the section EX 50(4) income interest calculation, without the additional language proposed by submitters. While we are not aware of any concerns arising from this in practice, and the policy intent is clear from the earlier remedial and this one, we agree that it would provide additional certainty if both sections EX 46(3)(a)(ii) and EX 35(a) were amended.

Comment The sections raised by the submitters relate to the entrance test – whether income is attributed under the FIF rules or the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules. Officials acknowledge that there are good reasons for amending this test where an interest is only held for part of an accounting period. However, this is an established test that has been consistently applied across decades and multiple tax Acts (eg, section 245F(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976). There are also other tests that rely on a similar calculation (eg, the foreign investment PIE requirements in section HM 55D(3)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007). Officials think it would be preferable for this to be considered for introduction in a future Bill. This would provide more exposure to the potential change as well as the possibility for further consultation than is possible at this stage of the current Bill. This project is not currently on the Government’s tax and social policy work programme and would need to be considered alongside the Government’s other priorities.

It is an administrative nightmare having a multitude of depreciation rates for every asset. Comment Depreciation is a measure of the reduction in the value of an asset over time.

Comment Sections CB 6AB, CB 6AC and CB 6AE, which provide rollover relief for the purposes of the bright-line test in relation to certain transfers of residential land, only apply if the land in question was acquired by the person disposing of it on or after 27 March 2021. Officials agree that the restriction of rollover relief to situations where the land was acquired by the transferor on or after 27 March 2021 is an error that should be corrected. Remediating this mistake would provide the intended policy outcome that rollover relief applies to all qualifying transfers made on or after 1 April 2022, consistent with the Commissioner’s statements in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34, No 5 (June 2022). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfers from a trust following death of settlor Submission (nsaTax Ltd) Section CB 6AB(2)(b) does not allow rollover relief when a property that was transferred into a family trust by the settlors is subsequently transferred back to the surviving settlor(s) following the death of a settlor. Consideration should be given to allowing rollover relief in this situation. Comment Section CB 6AB(2) applies in the scenario where the trustee of a family trust transfers land to a settlor (or a group of settlors). One of the tests for rollover relief under the section (which applies if the receiving settlor or “transferee” had previously transferred the land to the trust) Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 233 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] will only apply in a “multiple transferees” situation if the land each transferee receives from the trustee is in proportion to what they had originally transferred to the trust. The submitter has pointed out that this proportionality requirement does not allow rollover relief to apply in the scenario where one of the settlors dies and, following their death, all the land (including the deceased’s share) is transferred out of the trust to the surviving settlors. This outcome is contrary to what was intended, and officials therefore recommend relaxing the proportionality requirement in the situation where one of the settlors has died. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

Comment Officials disagree with the submitter. While the main home exclusion from the 10-year bright-line test treats construction days as main home days, the 10-year test operates on an apportionment basis. In other words, under the 10-year test, a person pays tax for periods where the property is not used as a main home. The main home exclusion from the 5-year bright-line test operates as an all-or-nothing test – if the property is used for most of the bright-line period as a main home then the bright-line test will not apply at all, including to periods where the property is not used as a main home. It would not be appropriate to treat the period that the property is under construction as ”main home days” under this test (especially given the shorter bright-line period) because it could mean a property is exempt from tax under the bright-line test despite only being used as a main home for a much shorter period of time than the period the property was not used as a main home (ie, rented out). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Design of construction period rule in relation to off- the-plan sales Submission (KPMG) Consideration should be given to whether any construction days need to be adjacent to days the person occupied the property as their main home. It is unclear how the main home Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 235 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] exclusion applies where a person purchases land off the plan (intending to move in once completed) but then disposes of their interest in the land prior to settlement. Comment Officials disagree with the submitter that the application of the main home exclusion from the 5-year bright-line test is unclear where a person purchases land off the plans intending to move in but sells the property prior to settlement. For the main home exclusion to apply, the land needs to be used as a main home for most of the bright-line period. In this case, the property has not been used as a main home at all, and therefore the main home exclusion does not apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Supportive of proposal to ignore construction period Submission (KPMG) We are generally supportive of the changes. Comment Officials welcome the support. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Time bar and the main home exclusion Submission (KPMG) We submit that:  An amendment is required to permit the Commissioner to re-assess time-barred periods where the retrospective law change reduces the amount of tax the person owes in the time-barred income year.  There should be a legal obligation to the Commissioner to re-assess prior periods that have not been time-barred, rather than it being up to the Commissioner’s discretion. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 236 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Public guidance should be issued on this matter to ensure taxpayers understand the process for applying for a refund. Comment The submitter is correct that ignoring the construction period for the purposes of the main home exclusion from the 5-year bright-line test may retrospectively reduce the amount of tax that taxpayers were liable for in periods that have already been assessed. For periods that have not yet been time barred, section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) is sufficient to enable these refunds to occur. An amendment is not necessary because the Commissioner will not exercise their discretion to decline a refund in these circumstances. In terms of whether an amendment is necessary to re-assess time-barred periods, officials consider it highly unlikely that any taxpayer would have had their refund time barred in these circumstances, as follows:  Section RM 2(1) provides that the Commissioner must refund an amount of overpaid tax if the Commissioner is satisfied that the person is entitled to the refund before the end of the 4-year period under section 108(1) of the TAA.  Section 108(1) prevents the Commissioner amending an assessment if 4 years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return.  The 5-year bright-line test applies to land acquired on or after 29 March 2018. For a refund to be time barred, the taxpayer would have had to acquire land on or after 29 March 2018, construct a dwelling and live in it for a period and then sell it before 31 March 2018. Given the time it takes to obtain resource and building consent and construct a dwelling, officials do not consider this timeline to be feasible. The 2019 and later tax years would not be time barred by March 2024, which is when the Bill is expected to be enacted. For example, the return for the 2019 tax year is not due until July 2019 or March 2020 (depending on if the taxpayer has a tax agent or not), and 4 years from the end of the 2020 tax year is 31 March 2024.

Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Capturing of income Submission (A Bramley) Child support assessments need to capture all income diverted by a liable parent to another entity. The income used in child support assessments needs to be the same as the income used for Working for Families purposes. Comment The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 included amendments that more closely align the definition of “income” used for child support purposes with other wider definitions of income used for Working for Families and student loans. Interest and dividend income are now included as income for child support assessments and losses from earlier years are no longer offset. These amendments mean that the definition of “income” used better reflects a parent’s financial capacity to pay child support. Interest and dividend information is now reported to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. Inland Revenue can include these amounts as income for child support assessments. Widening the definition further to include, for example, non-locked-in PIE income (which is not provided to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis), would mean that parents would need to provide this information each year. To keep compliance costs to a minimum, these other factors are not included as income for child support formula assessment purposes.

Issue: Child support formula Submission (A Bramley) The child support formula is needlessly complicated. It does not provide significant funds for supporting children.

Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Three-month meal allowance tax exemption time limit should be reconsidered Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The three-month meal allowance tax exemption should be reconsidered in the context of the Cyclone response on the East Coast. Comment Officials do not consider that the three-month meal allowance should be extended. The provision of meals is inherently private expenditure that is incurred by every worker regardless of their location. Accommodation allowances differ because the provision of accommodation is an extra cost for an employee, particularly when they continue to maintain a home in another location. Meal allowances do not follow this profile and consequently we see these as quite distinct. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

The submissions do not directly relate to proposed changes in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill and are outside the scope of the Government’s current tax policy work programme. Issue: Overreach of the associated persons rules Submission (Financial Services Federation, Australian Securitisation Forum) A person should not be associated with a securitisation trust (or treated as holding related- party debt) simply because the person (or an associate of the person) is a settlor of the securitisation trust, has the power to appoint or remove the trustee, or is a beneficiary, settlor or person with a power of appointment or removal of a security trust.

Issue: Notes issued by a securitisation trust should be excluded from the restricted transfer pricing rules Submission (Financial Services Federation, Australian Securitisation Forum) Notes issued by a securitisation trust should be excluded from section GC 18 (Loan features disregarded by rules for transfer pricing arrangements). When an originator holds junior notes, the restricted transfer pricing rules require the junior notes to be priced for tax purposes as if they ranked equally with the senior notes under the transfer pricing rules (as the originator and securitisation SPV will be associated parties). This means part of the interest paid by the securitisation SPV will not be deductible. This is because section GC 18 requires subordination to be disregarded. However, subordination is fundamental to the structure and purpose of a securitisation, and it should not be disregarded in this case. Comment Officials recognise the matter raised by the submitter and confirm they are actively assessing the need for remedial amendments to address this. However, this work is still in progress and will not be included in the current Bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted.

Comment GST is designed to be a tax on all consumption in New Zealand, which helps to ensure the tax is as efficient and fair as possible. Local authority rates fund services provided by local authorities to ratepayers and therefore represent consumption that should be subject to GST. Not applying GST to rates would create market distortions by giving price advantages to local authorities at the expense of private sector competitors (such as private rubbish collection services). Giving rates a concessionary GST treatment could also lead to greater compliance and administration costs. Finally, removing GST from rates would have a fiscal cost that may necessitate a reduction in spending on public services provided by central government, or an increase in other taxes to make up the funding shortfall. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remove GST on fresh fruit and vegetables Submission (Phillip Coghini) The Government should remove GST on all fresh fruit and vegetables. The submitter considers this policy would have the following advantages. The policy:  is administratively easy to implement  does not impose high compliance costs on businesses  promotes an affordable and healthier diet for low-income families Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 245 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  will have a deflationary impact and will see a drop in the Consumer Price Index for the first quarter after implementation, and  has been implemented in Australia. Comment New Zealand’s GST system is often regarded internationally as the model consumption tax because it applies so comprehensively (with very few exceptions) to most goods and services at a single standard rate of 15%. This broad application allows the government to efficiently raise revenue and minimise compliance costs for businesses that charge and collect GST. Providing concessionary treatment for fresh fruit and vegetables would reduce the efficiency of the GST system and would increase affected businesses’ compliance costs because they would be required to determine which products are zero rated or standard rated. As a result, businesses may not pass on the full savings, reducing the benefits to individuals. Additionally, removing GST on fresh fruit and vegetables is an inefficient way to support low- income families. This is because higher-income households would benefit more from the policy in absolute terms than the lower-income households the policy is intended to assist. Providing targeted assistance to lower-income households in the form of transfer payments would be a more efficient and effective way to support those households. Finally, the removal of GST on fresh fruit and vegetables would have a fiscal cost that may necessitate a reduction in spending on public services or an increase in other taxes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 83 Issue: Incorrect terminology Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The proposed amendments to section 25(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 do not make sense. Comment The Bill proposes to replace some incorrect terminology with the correct terminology. Section 25(4) was replaced by No 10 of 2022, section 31(7), effective 30 March 2022. However, in the amendment, the reference to “the credit note or debit note” referred to the Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 246 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] wrong concept, it should have referred to “the tax invoice". The Bill proposes inserting the correct term into the amendment with effect from 30 March 2022. Section 25(4) was amended again by No 10 of 2022, section 31(8)(a)(iii), effective 1 April 2023. The phrase “the credit note or debit note” was replaced with “the supply correction information”. The Bill proposes to replace the reference to “the supply correction information” in the amendment with the correct term, “the taxable supply information” with effect from 1 April 2023. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 247 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Operation of the financial arrangements entry rules where the borrower is insolvent Submission (Bell Gully) When two offshore-incorporated subsidiaries of a New Zealand wholly-owned group become New Zealand tax resident so that a loan between them becomes subject to the financial arrangements rules, the parties are required to apply the entry rules in sections EW 37 and EW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007 respectively. Those rules require the parties to calculate the market value of their obligations and entitlements under the loan. However, if the borrower happens to be insolvent at the time, it is possible the two companies will have different acquisition prices under those entry rules. In particular:  For the borrower, the market value that it would be required to pay to a third party to assume its obligations under the loan can be assumed to be the face value amount that it currently owes.  For the lender, the market value may be less, due to the insolvent position of the borrower, so a third party may be prepared to pay significantly less than the face value of the loan. If that loan is subsequently remitted, section EW 46C (which is intended to ensure that no adverse tax consequences occur when debt owned within a wholly-owned group is remitted), will treat the loan as being repaid in full. For the borrower, this will result in the amount it is treated as repaying being equal to its face value so there are no further tax consequences. For the lender, they are also treated as receiving the full face value of the loan; however this will be higher than the “consideration provided” at the time the loan entered the tax base, so that could give rise to financial arrangements income to the lender. That outcome is inconsistent with the intended operation of section EW 46C. The submitter recommends either:  section EW 46C is amended so the lender is treated as receiving only the amount deemed to have been paid upon entry to the financial arrangements rules, or  an amendment to the deemed acquisition under section EW 41 to change the acquisition cost to match the deemed or actual repayment. Comment The purpose of section EW 46C is to recognise that a remission of debt between two members of a wholly-owned group (or to the extent it is proportional with ownership) places the overall group in the same economic position before and after the remission. When this Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 248 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] debt is always between two New Zealand tax residents any impairment prior to an eventual remission will not result in a tax impost because there is symmetry across the amount lent and the amount deemed to be repaid. Officials agree this is not the case where the two sides of the loan have entered the New Zealand tax base at different values for the reasons outlined by the submitter. In this instance, a remission of some or all of the debt outstanding would still leave the group in the same economic position, and it would be inappropriate to effectively tax the lender on a loss incurred prior to them becoming a New Zealand tax resident. Point of difference Officials have discussed this submission with the submitter and have agreed that the case for preventing taxable income to the lender is clearer if the debt is remitted than if the debt was repaid in full. If the debt is actually repaid, the lender has only received back their original principal (plus potentially any interest), they have not made an overall gain on a worldwide basis; however, they have made a gain since the arrangement entered the New Zealand tax base, which is the purpose of the deemed acquisition. Therefore, officials recommend that the amendment relates only to a deemed repayment under section EW 46C rather than actual repayments. Officials would not expect a taxpayer in this situation to remit a debt that could or would otherwise be repaid to prevent financial arrangements income arising. Unlike the full value of the debt, the market value of a debt, even on an unimpaired loan, will be reduced to reflect that time will need to pass before the lender receives repayment. Reducing the deemed repayment under section EW 46C to the market value would result in the deemed repayment being smaller than it should be. Instead, the amount of repayment should be reduced by the amount of impairment included in the deemed acquisition calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Section EW 46D should be repealed or amended Submission (Mayne Wetherell) Section EW 46D of the Income Tax Act 2007, which was enacted in the Taxation (Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023, imposes a tax liability in certain circumstances when a company repays debt using the proceeds of issuing shares to the lender. The Officials’ Report on the Bill, at p 325, included “It would not apply to a solvent borrower that issues a convertible note, even if the note is later converted when the borrower is Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 249 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] insolvent”. However, the section as enacted does apply to convertible notes and other arrangements entered into by solvent debtors. Section EW 46D alters the long-standing treatment of certain financial arrangements and is inconsistent with assurances officials gave to the Select Committee. Section EW 46D should therefore be either: a. repealed and an appropriately targeted provision developed for inclusion in a future Bill, or b. amended to be consistent with the scope provided in the Officials’ Report. Comment a. The purpose of section EW 46D is to require shares issued by an insolvent debtor to be valued at their market value when the proceeds of that share issue are used to repay outstanding debt. Because the market value of shares in an insolvent company will often be low, this can result in debt remission income when the debt is repaid using the proceeds of these low value shares. Most shares issued that would be covered by section EW 46D will not be issued as part of a convertible note, and officials consider it is important the section continues to apply to this situation. In general, officials have no reason to consider the section is not working as intended and do not support it being repealed. b. Another way shares can be issued is as part of a convertible note, which is issued as debt but subsequently converts into shares at a later date. It is possible that a company can issue a convertible note when it is solvent but has become insolvent by the time the conversion occurs. Officials consider there are arguments that a convertible note issued by a solvent borrower but converted to shares after that borrower becomes insolvent should be covered by section EW 46D. However, we acknowledge there are also arguments against this position and officials’ advice in the previous Officials’ Report was that the section would not apply in this circumstance. We recommend that the section is amended to clarify that it does not apply when the conversion of debt into shares occurs pursuant to the conversion of a convertible note issued by a borrower who is solvent when the note is issued. Officials will consider whether a further amendment to cover this situation should be recommended for a future Bill and, if so, provide opportunity for affected parties to consult on such a proposal at that time. Recommendation a. That the submission be declined. b. That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 250 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Clause 28 Issue: Cross-references in section FC 2(3) Submission (Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand) The submitter has queried whether the proposed expansion of sections cross-referenced in section FC 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should include section FC 9D. Comment Section FC 2(3) lists several exceptions to the general valuation rule that applies to certain transfers of property. The list of exceptions in section FC 2(3) is proposed to be updated to reflect the recent addition of provisions that override the general rule, as well as several relatively longstanding exceptions that were previously omitted from being listed in section FC 2(3) (in each case as either a simple oversight or an inadvertent consequence of the 2007 rewrite of the Income Tax Act). Section FC 9D applies when residential land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and is part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi) is transferred to a trust that is either a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority. Given there is no overlap between section FC 9D and the general valuation rule, 8 section FC 9D is not included in the exceptions proposed to be added to section FC 2(3). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Platform economy – allow any GST-registered underlying supplier to remain responsible for their own GST obligations Submission (Oral submission raised by Deloitte) The submitter considers: 8 The general valuation rule (in section FC 2(1)) applies mostly to the transfer of property in gift, trust resettlement or inheritance scenarios, or in certain cases where property is distributed by a trustee of a trust to a beneficiary or by a company to a shareholder. Transfers of residential land to trusts pursuant to te Tiriti settlements are not in scope of the general valuation rule in section FC 2(1). Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 251 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a. Changes that will require large information and technological investments by various people should have a longer implementation timeframe by default of 24 months. This would have been useful for the platform economy GST changes because now affected platform operators have compressed timeframes to implement the necessary changes ahead of the rules taking effect on 1 April 2024. b. Taxpayers that sell affected services through electronic marketplaces and that are already registered for GST should be able to choose to remain responsible for their own GST obligations. This process should be made easy. Allowing this would also reduce issues associated with implementation for affected sellers and platform operators. Inland Revenue should be empowered to allow this. Such changes would still ensure that GST was collected from sellers that are not registered for GST. c. Inland Revenue should be given the tools to share information on who is GST registered and who is not with platform operators. Comment a. Lead-in time for tax changes is usually determined by the Government following advice from a range of different sources including tax policy officials and affected parties. This advice is developed during the policy development process. In this particular case, officials note the platform economy rules that come into force on 1 April 2024 were enacted as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023, which passed into law in March 2023. The rules are based on the GST rules for remote services. This means the rules use the same tests to determine whether a marketplace operator is treated as the supplier and therefore has a GST obligation on a supply that is actually made by another person (a seller). Officials note that affected platform operators have been given a longer implementation timeframe for the platform economy rules than they were given to comply with the remote services rules, which platforms have been successfully complying with since 1 October 2016. Inland Revenue is committed to assisting platform operators to comply with the new rules and encourages platforms to reach out with any questions they may have. b. The platform economy rules were intended to capture GST at a marketplace level from the broadest possible range of sellers, including GST-registered sellers. There are existing opt-out provisions that apply for specific sellers, but these provisions were deliberately limited to more significant enterprises, such as multinational hotel chains. The policy rationale for allowing these sorts of sellers to continue being responsible for their own GST obligations is these sellers are large enough to have sophisticated accounting systems and practices in place for managing their GST compliance, and it would be burdensome and result in no additional GST revenue for them to be subjected to marketplace rules where the marketplace operator is responsible for accounting for GST. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 252 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Officials consider that allowing GST-registered sellers more generally to opt-out of the platform economy rules could undermine the effectiveness of the rules and could result in less tax being collected. This is because any seller that is motivated to avoid GST could register for GST to opt out of the rules, and then be non-compliant with their own GST obligations. c. Officials agree that providing platform operators with the ability to verify the GST registration status of an underlying supplier would be a helpful addition that would support the implementation of the platform economy rules. This is currently being explored further by Inland Revenue. While such a service is explored, officials note the legislation already affords platform operators with protection if they rely on information provided to them by a seller on their GST registration status.

This remedial was made to remove significant compliance costs that served no benefit. Similarly, section 69B of the TAA requires a Māori authority to file an annual IR8J return for their Māori authority credit account (MACA). IR8J’s were omitted from the original amendment. Section 69B should be amended so a Māori authority that is a member of a Māori authority consolidated group is not required to file an IR8J return if the account has no balance at all times during the relevant tax year. This change should apply from the 2020–21 and later income years to align with the ICA remedial item. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Information sharing with Te Whatu Ora for COVID-19 response purposes Submission (Matter raised by officials) “Government agency” as defined under clause 23B, schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to include Te Whatu Ora (legal name Health New Zealand). Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 258 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment In 2020, clause 23B was introduced to schedule 7 to allow information sharing between Inland Revenue and other government agencies for COVID-19 response purposes. This facilitated information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Health for contact tracing. However, this clause no longer reflects operational realities because contact tracing has been assumed by Te Whatu Ora, which is not a “government agency” as defined in this clause. This means that Inland Revenue is unable to directly disclose information to Te Whatu Ora for COVID-19 response purposes. This does not align with the policy intent of facilitating operational efficiency for an effective COVID-19 response. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying that individuals earning “non-reportable income” can change balance dates Submission (Matter raised by officials) It is not clear under current legislation whether an individual earning income that is not reportable income (income that is not taxed at source, such as income from operating a business as a sole trader) can return income to a non-standard balance date. That is, a balance date that is earlier or later than the standard 31 March balance date. Taxpayers can make a request to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to change their balance date under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). However, a restriction in section 38(1C) prevents individuals whose “final account” for a tax year is treated as an assessment from being able to request a balance date change. Both individuals only earning “reportable income” (income that is taxed at source by a payer, such as salary or wages or dividends) and individuals also earning non-reportable income (income that is not taxed at source, such as business income), will have a final account under the individuals’ income information reporting rules in subpart 3B of Part 3 of the TAA. In addition, section 22H(4) of the TAA requires that individuals provide income information as part of the process of finalising their account for a tax year to the Commissioner by 7 July in the following tax year (this is consistent with the standard due date for income tax returns). An individual wanting to return income to a late balance date may be unable to comply with this 7 July due date because it would be very close to or before the end of the income year they would be providing the information in relation to. This issue does not arise for non-individuals with a late balance date because under section 37(1)(b) of the TAA their income tax return will Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 259 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] be due by the seventh of the month that is the fourth month after the end of their income year. The effect of the current legislation is an unintended consequence of 1 April 2019 amendments simplifying individuals’ end-of-year income tax obligations. Prior to the 2019 amendments, the law did not allow individuals only earning income taxed at source by a payer to request a balance date change. However, individuals also earning income that was not taxed at source were able to request a change of balance date and return income to a late balance date. Officials recommend amendments are made to reverse the unintended effects of the 2019 amendments. The amendments would clarify that individuals earning income that is not reportable income (ie, income not taxed at source) can request a change of balance date under section 38. The amendments would also adjust the due date for the provision of information under section 22H(4) for individuals with a late balance date so that it aligns with the due date in section 37(1)(b). The proposed amendments should apply on and from 1 April 2019, this being the date that the legislative changes with the unintended effects discussed above apply from. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Platform economy Information reporting and exchange – penalties Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 142K(2)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies from 1 January 2024 and provides that sellers operating through digital platforms are liable for a penalty if they do not provide information that they are required to provide to a platform operator under the OECD model reporting standard for digital platforms. It is noted that the OECD reporting rules do not explicitly require sellers to provide information to platform operators, the rules merely require the operator to provide information in respect of sellers to the tax authority. Although it is implied that a seller would be required to provide this information to the operator, it is not explicit. There are no explicit obligations on sellers under the OECD reporting rules, so section 142K(2)(c) may not work as intended and should be clarified. A remedial amendment should be introduced to ensure that a seller is liable for a penalty if they do not provide information to a platform operator that the operator requires to fulfil their reporting obligations under the OECD reporting rules. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 260 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Record-keeping requirements for platform operators Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 22(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out record-keeping requirements for various taxes and provides that these records shall be retained for a period of at least seven years after the end of the relevant tax year to which they relate. New paragraphs (fe) and (lf) were added to section 22(2) as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 to extend these record-keeping requirements to platform operators in the platform economy. The OECD information reporting rules that platform operators are required to adhere to under the platform economy changes operate on a calendar year basis, rather than a tax year. A remedial amendment should be introduced to make it clear that platform operators with obligations to provide Inland Revenue with information under the OECD’s information reporting rules are required to retain records for seven years following the end of the relevant calendar year instead of tax year (which ends 31 March). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: 12-month limit on emergency event payments for Working for Families purposes Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) should be amended to remove the 12-month limitation that applies to the treatment of emergency relief payments for Working for Families (WFF) purposes. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 261 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Comment Under current law, payments aimed at relieving the adverse effects of an event are exempt from family scheme income, provided the event is declared an emergency event by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. However, to be exempt income for the purposes of WFF, the period of the Commissioner’s emergency event determination must be 12 months, or less, since the first day of the event. This creates inflexibility that impacts the Government’s ability to distribute payments aimed at emergency event relief. Additionally, it impacts the WFF entitlements of emergency relief payment recipients. This issue has arisen most recently in relation to payments and support being developed as part of the Kaupapa Māori pathway, which has been established for Māori land and communities following the January floods and Cyclone Gabrielle. Although these events have been declared emergency events by the Commissioner, that declaration cannot be extended beyond late January 2024, and many of these payments may not have been paid out by then. To ensure that legislation is suited to current and future contexts, and to give the Government flexibility in the way it responds to emergency events, officials propose that section 91AAS(2) and (3) of the TAA be amended to remove references to a 12-month maximum period. These changes will ensure that payments for emergency event relief do not constitute family scheme income for the period set by the Commissioner in an emergency event Determination. This will be the case even if the period set by the Commissioner is greater than 12 months since the occurrence of the emergency event. It is proposed that these amendments apply on and from 1 September 2023, which is the date following the end of the last Determination (DET EE 23/01 ). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Cross-border workers: Nominated taxpayer Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 24HB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables a non-resident contractor to enter into an arrangement with a person resident in New Zealand in relation to their tax affairs or social policy entitlements, or both. The section has not yet come into force. Concerns have been raised regarding the implementation of section 24HB. In particular, that the joint and several liability condition may overreach and cause unintended consequences. In addition, existing provisions already enable non-resident contractors to enter into an arrangement with a nominated person, agent or intermediary making this provision somewhat redundant. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 262 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, the provision does confirm operational practice with regards to accepting the reporting and payment of employment-related taxes (pay-as-you-earn, fringe benefit tax and employer’s superannuation contribution tax) in some circumstances. These circumstances arise where a New Zealand resident undertakes employment-related tax compliance activities on behalf of a non-resident contractor. Given this, officials recommend that section 24HB be amended to narrow its application to employment-related taxes only, and the joint and several liability condition should be removed. The proposed amendment would then reflect operational practice. The proposed amendment would apply on and from 1 April 2024, the date section 24HB comes into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 263 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 2007 Issue: Disability support payments, reference to Ministry for Disabled People Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CW 52B of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that where a person receives a direct funding disability support payment, the payment is not subject to income tax. This section previously referred to payments made by the Ministry of Health or District Health Boards. It was updated in July 2022 as a consequential change under health reform legislation to refer to payments made by Health New Zealand or the Māori Health Authority. However, due to a legislative oversight, the July 2022 updates failed to reflect that the Ministry for Disabled People was established in July 2022 and began administering some of the direct funding disability support payments. Section CW 52B needs to be amended to refer to direct funding disability support payments made by the Ministry for Disabled People or the Ministry of Health, with application from July 2022, to ensure the income tax exemption continues to apply as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deducting expenditure related to mitigating environmental hazards Submission (Matter raised by officials) The policy intent of section DB 46 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is to allow deductions for expenditure that involves avoiding, remedying, or mitigating environmental contaminants or the making of noise. Depending on the type of expenditure, it is either fully deductible (eg, expenditure related to monitoring the discharge of a contaminant) in the year it is incurred or gradually deductible on an amortised basis over the resulting asset’s expected life (eg, expenditure on riparian planting). In the latter case, the expenditure can either be amortised on the equivalent of a straight-line or diminishing value basis. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 264 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Errors in the drafting of the current provision emerged during a ruling application, which then relied on the savings provisions in the preceding version of the Income Tax Act to achieve the ruling. The errors relate to the use of terms used in the depreciation provisions within section DB 46. Expenditure to mitigate environmental hazards is not depreciable property so the use of terms defined in relation to depreciable property is not correct in the context of section DB 46. Terms used include “adjusted tax value”, “diminishing value method”, “diminishing value rate”, “straight-line method”, and “straight-line rate. In the case of the definition of “diminished value”, also used in the section, errors arose during the rewrite of the Income Tax Act in 2007. As a result, section DB 46 should be amended to replace the references to terms used in the depreciation provisions with equivalent terms for the section and the errors in the “diminished value” definition should be rectified to ensure that expenditure to avoid, remedy, or mitigate environmental hazards is deductible as intended. The amendments to section DB 46 should apply retrospectively from the date the provision was first introduced into the Income Tax Act 2004. The amendments to the definition of “diminished value” should apply from 1 April 2008. A savings provision should be included to ensure that positions on deductions already taken are not able to be re-opened. It is important that section DB 46 works as intended because it is likely to be increasingly applied in the future. This is due to recent law changes requiring a large amount of expenditure to be incurred to remove asbestos from non-residential buildings. More generally, there will be a greater focus on mitigating environmental hazards as part of responding to climate change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Time to make a look-through company election Submission (Matter raised by officials) A new company can become a look-through company by making an election to the Commissioner before the last day for filing the return of income of the company per section HB 13(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This creates confusion for taxpayers because this does not align with the general rules for other elections, which permit elections to be filed on the last day to file a tax return. Despite this, Inland Revenue has been permitting elections to be filled on the last day for the tax return to be filed. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 265 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Section HB 13(3) should be amended so the last election date for a new company to become a look-through company is the last day to file the company’s tax return. This change should apply for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2011 to provide certainty to taxpayers who have relied on Inland Revenue’s practice since the inception of the look-through company election process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Setting the early payment discount rate Submission (Matter raised by officials) The early payment discount (EPD) should be amended so one rate is applicable throughout a tax year. Currently, the EPD rate changes according to the Commissioner’s paying rate. The recent economic environment has resulted in the paying rate changing more often than was envisaged. This creates uncertainty for taxpayers about which EPD rate will apply to their total tax payable for the year. This uncertainty, and the risks of overpaying or underpaying the tax payable, does not align with the policy intent of incentivising voluntary payment of taxes by businesses in their first year of paying tax. To provide clarity, section RC 38(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended so the EPD is pegged to the Commissioner’s paying rate as at 31 March of the previous tax year from the 2024–25 and later income years. Furthermore, a separate amendment to section RC 38 should be made to use the highest Commissioner’s paying rate during the income year to calculate the EPD rate for the 2022–23 and 2023–24 income years. This will ensure that taxpayers were not disadvantaged when interest rates increased during years that were completed prior to the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 266 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] HOUSING R EMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Unintended land tainting on a partition of land Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CB 10(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure it does not apply to a disposal of land subject to section CW 3C. Comment Section CB 10(2) taxes land owned by a person associated with a land developer, if it is acquired at the time the developer is in business, and is disposed of within 10 years of acquisition. Section CW 3C is intended to ensure that there is no income tax on a partition of land between co-owners, to the extent to which there is no substantive change in ownership. A taxpayer who is exempt under section CW 3C on a partition of land may be subject to the land tainting rule in section CB 10(2), contrary to what was intended. This will occur where part of the land is developed and sold. For example, consider a taxpayer who has held land on capital account for many years, but decides to subdivide the land into townhouses and keep one for themself. The taxpayer incorporates a company to carry out the subdivision. The land is to be subdivided into five lots, with the taxpayer owning one and the company owning the remainder. The company therefore acquires 80% of the land, with the taxpayer holding the remaining 20%. Upon subdivision, the taxpayer ends up owning a 20% interest in five lots of land, and the company ends up owning an 80% interest in five lots of land. To achieve what the parties intended, the company needs to transfer an 80% interest in one lot to the taxpayer, and the taxpayer needs to transfer a 20% interest in four lots to the company. These transfers will be exempt under section CW 3C. However, the taxpayer would also be treated as acquiring the 80% interest in the land while associated with a developer (ie, the company that they established to develop the land). As a result, the land intended to be retained by the taxpayer is tainted and will be subject to income tax if disposed of within 10 years. This is contrary to the policy’s intent. Officials recommend that section CB 10(2) is amended with effect on and from 27 March 2021 (the date that section CW 3C originally applied from) to ensure that the policy intent of section CW 3C is not defeated by an unintended tainting. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 267 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Partitioning of land among co-owners Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CW 3C of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that disposals between co-owners on a subdivision of land are not taxed to the extent that the post- subdivision allocation aligns with the original co-ownership shares. Comment Prior to the introduction of section CW 3C, co-owners who subdivided land and kept one parcel each were considered to have a 50% share in each parcel, and therefore to have disposed of their share in the parcel they didn’t keep to the other co-owner. Section CW 3C was intended to ensure that there is no income tax where there is no substantive change in ownership following a subdivision. If there is an effective change in ownership proportions, only the difference should be subject to tax. It was intended that the exemption in new section CW 3C would apply to the extent that post-subdivision allocation aligns with original co-ownership shares, with an exception for instances where there is a small difference in the allocations of up to 5% of the smallest co-owner’s original holding. If the difference is greater than 5% of the smallest co-owner’s original holding, the base rule should apply (ie to the extent the post-subdivision allocation aligns with the original co- ownership shares). The 5% rule is to ensure minor differences are ignored (these could arise due to topography for example). The current provision is ineffective in achieving this as follows:  The provision does not apply on a “to the extent” basis, which means if there is no proportionality, the exemption does not apply.  The 5% rule as drafted only applies to the co-owner who owns the smallest proportion of the land, not all co-owners.  The provision does not apply if any of the land is disposed of to a third party. For example, if two siblings purchase land, subdivide and build two houses and one sibling buys one of the houses with their partner, the entire provision wouldn’t apply and both siblings would be taxed on a disposal. Instead, only the disposal to the partner should be taxed. Officials recommend that section CW 3C is amended with effect on and from 27 March 2021 (the date the provision originally applied from) to ensure that only disposals that constitute an effective change in ownership are taxed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 268 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Error in trust provisions Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CB 6AB(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains two tests for rollover relief which are mutually exclusive (that is, it is not possible to get rollover relief under both tests). The first of these tests applies when the transferees had previously transferred the land in question to the trust, whereas the other test applies when the transferees had not previously transferred the land to the trust. The problem is that there is an “and” after the first test, which essentially requires both tests to be met for rollover relief to apply (even though this is clearly not possible and is not what was intended). Officials recommend that the drafting be clarified so the two tests are clearly separate from one another, and a taxpayer only needs to meet one of these tests for rollover relief to apply (provided that all other applicable requirements for rollover relief are met). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rollover relief and the main home exclusion Submission (Matter raised by officials) The main home exclusions from the bright-line test should be amended to ensure that, where rollover relief under section CB 6AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies, the use of the property by the transferor (for example, as a main home) is attributed to the transferee. Comment The bright-line test taxes residential land acquired and sold within a specified timeframe. Rollover relief ensures that the bright-line test is not triggered in certain common situations where there is a legal transfer of residential land, but no change in economic ownership. Section CB 6AB provides rollover relief for transfers to or from family trusts and certain other capacities from the bright-line test. The rollover provisions are ineffective in ensuring the bright-line test does not apply in certain circumstances where the main home exclusion also applies. For example, consider a family home that was acquired between 29 March 2018 and 27 March 2021 (therefore subject to a 5-year bright-line period), used as a family home for three years while under the ownership of Trust A, then transferred to Trust B and rented for a year before being sold. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 269 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Absent an amendment, Trust B will be taxed on the sale of the property under the bright-line test. This is because the main home exclusion will not apply as the property has not been used as a main home for most of the time it was owned by Trust B. However, if the actions of Trust A were attributed to Trust B, Trust B would be able to apply the main home exclusion because the beneficiaries of Trust B will be deemed to have occupied the property as their main home for three out of four years (ie, more than 50% of the time). Officials recommend that the main home exclusions in sections CB 16A and CZ 40 are amended with effect from 27 March 2021 (the date the rollover relief rules apply from) to reflect the rollover relief provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Land used for transitional housing Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section DH 4(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to include land used for transitional housing. Comment Section DH 4(4) provides that the interest limitation rules do not apply to interest incurred by a person for land, to the extent the land is used by either a registered community housing provider, a government department or Kāinga Ora and its wholly owned subsidiaries for social housing, temporary accommodation or other accommodation for people in need. It was always intended that this provision would also apply to land used by a transitional housing provider for one of the housing purposes listed in section DH 4(4). However, due to a drafting error, transitional housing providers were not included. Officials recommend that section DH 4(4) is amended with effect on and from 27 March 2021 (the date section DH 4 applied from) to include land rented to a person contracted by a government department to provide land for social or transitional housing. This will enable owners of land used by a transitional housing provider to provide social or temporary housing to claim interest deductions. It will also ensure that other transitional housing arrangements are cover – for example, a person who rents their property to a charity and that charity has a contract with the Department of Corrections to provide housing to ex- convicts who are recently released from prison.

Marketplace operators should be able to correct input tax deductions for the flat-rate credit when they realise the calculation will be wrong. This could apply, for example, when the value of the supply to which the flat-rate credit relates has changed. Comment GST-registered persons are generally able to adjust input tax deductions in accordance with adjustment rules in section 25 of the GST Act. These rules are not available for input tax deductions for the flat-rate credit for listed services. Marketplace operators that are responsible for deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit should be able to make similar corrections when they discover the amount of the flat-rate credit to be wrong. In these circumstances:  where the marketplace operator discovers they have under-deducted input tax for the flat-rate credit, they should be able to deduct additional input tax for the under- deduction, and  where the marketplace operator discovers they have over-deducted input tax for the flat-rate credit, they should be able to reduce future amounts of flat-rate credit payable to the underlying supplier (for example, host or driver). Marketplace operators should be able to make these adjustments in the GST return for the taxable period in which under-deduction or over-deduction is discovered. This would reduce compliance costs for marketplace operators and administration costs for Inland Revenue because otherwise manual adjustments would be required via requests to amend original GST assessments. This also ensures that underlying suppliers who receive the flat-rate credit receive the correct amounts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 272 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Issue: Listing intermediaries Submission (Matter raised by officials) Following enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023, it was identified that the rules do not adequately cater for many circumstances where a person, who provides property management services for short-term accommodation hosts in the platform economy (and may or may not operate an electronic marketplace of its own), lists accommodation on multiple third-party electronic marketplaces on behalf of their clients. In these circumstances, the new law requires that the operator of the electronic marketplace (that the guest used to make the booking) account for output tax on the supply and deduct input tax for the flat-rate credit. The operator is then required to pass the flat-rate credit on to the (non-GST registered) underlying supplier and provide them with a statement showing the amount of flat-rate credit passed on. This is difficult in practice because the marketplace operator is not the person the underlying supplier of the accommodation has a relationship with, but an entirely unrelated third party who presently has no or very little need to collect information about the underlying supplier. Following discussions with some affected businesses and private sector GST experts, officials recommend further amendments to ensure the rules are workable in these situations. Specifically, new rules should be introduced for a person who meets a legislative definition of “listing intermediary”, which would be a person who is tax resident in New Zealand and provides property management services to underlying suppliers of short-term accommodation where those services include listing accommodation for hire on multiple third-party electronic marketplaces. A listing intermediary would be responsible for deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit for non-GST registered underlying suppliers and for providing regular statements to those underlying suppliers (at least monthly) showing the amounts passed on. Unless the listing intermediary and the marketplace operator agree otherwise, the responsibility for output tax at the standard GST rate of 15% would remain with the marketplace operator, along with the requirement to provide taxable supply information to the guest. The listing intermediary would be treated as making a zero-rated supply of the accommodation to the marketplace operator. Any related services that the listing intermediary supplies directly to guests would also be treated as having been supplied to the marketplace operator (also as a zero-rated supply), with the marketplace operator being responsible for accounting for GST on those services at the 15% rate. To provide additional flexibility, a listing intermediary would be able to agree with a marketplace operator in writing that the listing intermediary, rather than the marketplace operator, is responsible for output tax at the 15% rate on supplies of accommodation as well as any services supplied by the listing intermediary directly to guests. As with the Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 273 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] recommended default rules described above, the listing intermediary would be responsible for deducting input tax for the flat-rate credit (if applicable) and would not be responsible for providing taxable supply information to recipients of listed services. Instead, marketplace operators would provide taxable supply information to guests directly. Officials recommend that these rules apply from 1 April 2024. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Flat-rate credit – technical matters Submission (Matter raised by officials) Several amendments should be made to ensure the flat-rate credit operates as intended:  It should be clarified that the flat-rate credit is not consideration for a supply of any goods or services by the underlying supplier.  The definition of “input tax” in section 3A of the GST Act should be amended to include a reference to the “flat-rate credit” because it is deducted as input tax, but not currently included in the definition.  Section CX 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure the flat-rate credit is excluded income whether the recipient of the credit is a GST-registered person or not.  The value of the flat-rate credit should not be reduced by the amount of any discount provided by a marketplace operator. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor remedial matters Submission (Matter raised by officials) The following remedial matters should also be addressed: Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 274 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Only non-individual underlying suppliers (accommodation hosts, drivers and deliverers) should be able to unilaterally opt out of the GST marketplace rules on the basis of exceeding more than $500,000 of taxable supplies in any 12-month period. Based on Inland Revenue data, no natural person underlying supplier would exceed this threshold and limiting the opt-out criteria accordingly would mitigate an integrity risk.  A clarifying amendment should be made for when a marketplace operator collects an amount to cover its GST liability from a customer’s payment due to an underlying supplier of listed services. The amendment should provide that this amount collected is not consideration for a supply.  Several consequential amendments to include a reference to “listed services” were made to the GST Act but these have no practical effect and should be removed to prevent confusion. References to “listed services” in the following provisions should therefore be removed: o section 9(9), which contains a special time of supply rule that is only relevant to operators of loyalty programmes o section 11A(1)(y), which does not operate as intended but treats a supply of listed services between marketplace operators as a zero-rated supply o section 20(4C) and (4D), which are special input tax deduction denial rules that apply for business-to-business supplies of remote services and low value imported goods that were incorrectly zero-rated. These rules have no application for listed services (no business-to-business exclusion applies to listed services).  A non-resident principal should be able to use a New Zealand tax resident agent, and in such circumstances the New Zealand resident agent should be treated as the supplier of the listed services.  When a marketplace operator is treated as the supplier of listed services, the marketplace operator should always be required to provide taxable supply information and supply correction information (where applicable) to the recipient. This should apply without the need for the recipient to request the information, and regardless of the recipient’s GST registration status.  Recent changes to the definition of “electronic marketplace” have, arguably, subtly changed the way in which the electronic marketplace rules apply in the low-value imported goods context (and may have similar implications for the new listed services rules). Minor wording changes are required to clarify the rules.  Section 60C(2BC) enables the Commissioner to issue determinations setting out criteria a person must meet if they wish to opt out of the marketplace rules but do not meet the other statutory criteria for an opt-out. An amendment is required to bring forward the application date for this provision from 1 April 2024 to 1 April 2023. This will enable the Commissioner to issue determinations before the marketplace rules take effect. This is consistent with the policy intent as reflected in the Bill commentary. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 275 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Technical drafting changes to ensure the legislation aligns with the policy intent by ensuring the Commissioner must have regard to the factors in both paragraphs of section 60C(2BD) and ensuring only those underlying suppliers who make taxable supplies of more than $500,000 can unilaterally opt out of the marketplace rules under section 60C(2BF). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Departmental Report – Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023-24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill Page 276 of 291 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] OTHER R EMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Revoking redundant regulation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 enables Inland Revenue to collect datasets from payment service providers (PSPs) on a regular basis. The datasets consist of aggregate data of merchant sales and are used to detect non-compliance, including hidden economy activities. The datasets are used for risk analysis and to ensure compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns including investigation of high-risk cases. Macro analysis of this information is also used in research and to inform policy. When the regulations were drafted, PSPs were concerned with Inland Revenue’s ability to criminally prosecute a PSP for late information filing, even if it was due to extenuating circumstances. Regulation 13 was introduced to provide PSPs with a criminal defence if they took reasonable steps to provide the information by the due date. On 11 May 2023, the Minister of Revenue received a letter from the Regulations Review Committee (the Committee) raising concern about regulation 13. The Committee, upon review of the Regulations, identified that regulation 13 potentially provides a defence against the offences and criminal penalties outlined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Therefore, there is concern that this secondary legislation amends the application of primary legislation, when it has not been expressly empowered to do so by the legislation under which it is made. Officials subsequently reviewed regulation 13 and concluded that it is ultra vires and should be revoked. This change will apply from the day after the date of assent.

Deployment and cutover
======================

The size of the task shutting down and upgrading our systems, transferring data to the new system before re-starting the systems and going live, cannot be underestimated. Our success was critical to New Zealand given that 80% of the Government’s income is collected by Inland Revenue. It was also critical to the reputation of the agency and the transformation programme.

Deployment was a workstream within core tax and social policy, the middlemen between the delivery team and the support team. Work on deployment began as soon as the scope had been agreed. This meant our deployment team had chance to familiarise themselves with the product characteristics, the data sources and size of the load and the overall complexity of the task, right from the start.

Business Transformation deployment plan
---------------------------------------

Deployment within our transformation comprised all activities required to implement the new solution into the Production environment and to ensure that the organisation was ready for the change. The deployment plan incorporated the deployment activities prepared by separate teams:

*   Business deployment plan – the operation tasks to be completed by the organisation
*   Heritage deployment plan – activities required to transition data out of our old systems
*   FAST deployment – activities required to prepare our new service platform
*   Digital ecosystem deployment plan - impacts and activities required within our digital channels.

Third parties
-------------

Cutover tasks weren’t restricted to the organisation or our main technical partner FAST but involved between 30 and 40 partners and supplier organisations, depending on the release, who all had a critical part to play over the cutover window.

We tested, and tested, then tested some more
--------------------------------------------

We practised the cutover from our old to our new system multiple times and tested everything thoroughly. There were 3 formal mock go-lives. The first, a paper walkthrough, the second, a full system walkthrough during working hours (which could last up to 2 weeks) and finally, a full technical go-live in real time.

It didn’t stop there. Where we uncovered issues or complexity, we re-tested and ran mini mocks. Release 4, where we transitioned student loans and KiwiSaver data into our new platform, involved the most complex data. Here we ran 6 mini mock go-lives before the data reconciliation was accurate.

As a result of the groundwork and disciplines we had put in place, we were able to cut-over remotely for the April 2020 release, within 2 weeks of New Zealand going into its first COVID-19 lockdown. What made this possible, was that our deployment and cutover team were very well prepared and very clear about what was required of them.

Cutover issues resolution process
---------------------------------

During cutover, any task which deviated from the master cutover plan, which could have had an impact on go-live was escalated to the cutover control centre. From there, there was a framework and process to follow which allowed the team to get back on track or manage the issue down the line.

This generally meant a core group getting together in a room to work through the issue. An unforeseen benefit of working remotely was the ability to network in a larger group of people through online meetings, thereby working through the issue faster.

While we opted to go-live remotely for our final 2 releases, the team missed the camaraderie of a tradition cutover, and the associated mountains of pizza and junk food that entailed.

Cutover window
--------------

For most technical programmes, cutover takes no more than 2, possibly 3 days, so this activity can happen over a weekend. With the complexity of our transformation, the cutover period was by necessity much longer, so we used public holidays to minimise the business hours our people and customers were unable to access the system. Our cutover windows varied from between 2 and 7 days (for Release 3), where we took advantage of Easter and ANZAC Day which fell in the same week that year.

While we planned the target date for go-live at an early stage, we did not know the duration of the cutover outage window for certain until after our third mock go-live. So we had to decide whether to keep the dates under wraps until we could offer our partners and customers certainty, or share the dates sooner and be prepared to change the message. We opted for transparency and only once had to recommunicate the dates.

Supporting our customers
------------------------

During the outage window, all of Inland Revenue’s systems were unavailable so even minimising the number of business days we were closed (to a maximum of 3), we were conscious of putting additional pressure on our customers.

Cutover involved closing all digital and voice channels (including myIR), front-of-house and required changes to payment dates for beneficiaries. Businesses were unable to file during the outage window, so the communication effort to make sure they were aware was significant.

Any changes to the treatment of customers around compliance was decided by the organisation, with communication managed by the programme.

Full details of the cutover process can be found in the Integrated Deployment Approach and Plan.

Go-live communications
----------------------

A separate plan was put together to prepare stakeholders for go-live – both internal and external ahead of go-live. This, as with all our communications, worked on the premise of ‘no surprises’ whether for our people, our Minister, customers and stakeholders inside and outside the organisation.

This included creating briefing packs for Members of Parliament on the changes involved in each release and the duration of the cutover window, so they could answer any questions raised by their constituents.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

When a deposit is made into an income equalisation scheme, the general rule is that it is accepted for the tax year in which the deposit is received. To be deductible in any income year, the deposit must be made within the [specified period](/api/glossary/item?id={D8381F89-11B1-40C6-8027-BCA9CCA17805})
 after the end of that income year. This is the shorter of:

*   six months after the [balance date](/api/glossary/item?id={28AACCE7-DC17-4ED8-B93C-9BEEFB29DA97})
    
*   one month after the due date for filing the return.

A specified period applies to both deposits and refunds.

Deposits and myIR
-----------------

You can now manage all your deposits in myIR.

Any deposits into your income equalisation (EQU) or environmental restoration (ERA) accounts will be:

*   reflected in your income profile
*   pre-populated into the 'other income' field of your income tax return.

Restrictions on deposits
------------------------

*   The minimum income equalisation deposit is $200.
*   The minimum environmental restoration deposit is $1,000.

Deposit amounts cannot exceed your net income from your qualifying activity in the year the deposit is accepted.

#### Payment methods

Deposits to reserve schemes need to be made electronically.

Interest on deposits
--------------------

Interest of 3% per annum will apply where a deposit is left in the scheme for a period of 12 months or more. Interest paid becomes part of the deposit and is credited at 31 March each year or when the deposit is refunded.

Interest is not treated as income in the tax year it is credited, only in the tax year when the deposit is refunded.

Resident withholding tax (RWT) should be deducted from any interest paid.

#### Income equalisation deposit time limit

Income equalisation deposits expire 5 years from the end of the accounting year in which the deposit was made. Any expired deposits will be refunded.

New deposit following a refund
------------------------------

If a refund has been made in a tax year, a deposit cannot be made after that date for the same period unless we are satisfied that all of the refund was used in 1 of the following situations:

*   developing or expanding your business
*   purchasing livestock for use in your farming business to replace livestock disposed of, or lost as a result of a self-assessed adverse event.

The refund may be able to be used as a deposit for the previous tax year if an election is made in the specified period or by the required date for that tax year.

The [required date](/api/glossary/item?id={A9F476C6-7926-49EE-8526-A2ACA8C69613})
 is the earlier of:

*   one month from the date of filing the return of income for the accounting year
*   one month from the date the return of income is due to be filed.

Example: Mr Forrest's refund request

Mr Forrest's balance date was 30 June 2017 with a tax agent extension of time to file till 31 March 2018.

His return was filed on 15 January 2018, so any deposits or refunds made up until 15 February 2018 will be accepted for the 2017 tax year.

Mr Forrest requests a refund on 30 September 2018 of $5,000. He includes this income in the 2019 tax year.

We will pre-populate the deposit into his tax return if he files through myIR or gateway services.

As Mr Forrest has a tax agents' extension of time to file his 2018 return up until 31 March 2019, he makes an election that the $5,000 be deposited for the 2018 tax year.

[Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010 "Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010")

Depreciation loading grandparenting
===================================

2010 amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 covers depreciation loading and amends the grandparenting provision.

_Sections EE 31 and EE 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Depreciation loading was removed on a prospective basis as part of Budget 2010. The policy intention was that an item for which there was a commitment for its purchase or construction in place on or before 20 May 2010 would continue to be eligible for loading. However, while the legislation that gave effect to this grandparenting worked in most situations, its result could be unclear or inconsistent with the policy intention in other instances.

Accordingly, the grandparenting provision has been amended to clarify the rule and ensure it works as intended.

### Key features

*   An item of depreciable property is eligible for loading if its owner either acquired it or was committed to its purchase or construction on or before 20 May 2010 (Budget day).
*   For the purpose of the rule, "commitment" can be demonstrated by an item's owner either having entered into a binding contract for it or alternatively, after deciding to purchase the item, the owner incurred some expense in relation to it.

### Detailed analysis

#### _New rule for depreciation loading grandparenting_

Section EE 31 has been amended to clarify when depreciation loading should be grandparented. Under the amended rule, there are two circumstances in which an item of depreciable property continues to be eligible for depreciation loading after 20 May 2010.

The first circumstance is when the item was acquired on or before 20 May 2010. The second is when the item's owner had decided to purchase or construct the item and, on or before 20 May 2010, either entered into a binding contract for it or incurred expenditure in relation to it after making the decision to acquire it.

One example of the second circumstance is when a person began building an item themselves before 20 May 2010 but had not finished it as at 20 May. Another example is when a person who was in the process of acquiring an asset comprising multiple components, but had only entered into contracts to purchase some of those components as at 20 May. In both cases the finished asset is eligible for depreciation loading.

It is important to note that the amended grandparenting rule only confers potential eligibility for depreciation loading. The item must still meet the other relevant criteria, for example, it cannot be a building or an imported second-hand car and cannot have been used previously in New Zealand.

#### _Meaning of "in relation to"_

An item may be eligible for depreciation loading if expenditure is incurred "in relation to" that item, and certain other criteria are met. Expenditure should be "in relation to" an item if the expenditure is on:

*   the item itself (for example, if it is under construction);
*   services relating directly to the item, such as having a contract for purchase drawn up;
*   component pieces of the item (the item is a single depreciable asset that is made up of multiple components); or
*   another item, if that item has a reasonable connection with the item in question. An item has a reasonable connection with another item if it would not function effectively or work as intended without the other item. For example, a piece of machinery and a shed designed to house it would have a reasonable connection with each other.

It is not necessarily the case when a decision is made to acquire multiple items as part of the same decision-making process that all of those items will have a reasonable connection with each other. While this suggests that there may be such a connection, it is not sufficient.

The requirement for a decision to purchase or build the item in question must also be met. If no decision had been made, the asset itself is not eligible for loading.

#### _Administrative requirements_

The Act introduces new subsection EE 31(4), which must be met for the amended grandparenting rule to apply. This requires a person to have either documenting evidence that they had, on or before 20 May 2010, decided to purchase or construct an item, or they must send to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a statutory declaration that states the same.

In some situations, a project may have been approved involving multiple items but there may not be evidence for specific items. For the administrative requirement to be satisfied for the item, it must be clear that the item was contemplated as part of the project approved on or before 20 May 2010.

Whether a set of documents provides sufficient evidence that a person had decided to purchase or construct an item on or before 20 May is a question of fact and circumstance. However, generally the documents would need to show that the business's standard purchasing process had been followed for the type of acquisition being made and approved in accordance with delegated authority levels. For example, if a purchase would usually only require a purchase order signed by the relevant manager, that would be sufficient evidence. If more detailed documentation was usually required, this would be needed to satisfy the administrative requirements.

If a person does not have the necessary documented evidence, the administrative requirements can be satisfied by providing to the Commissioner a statutory declaration that states the date when the person decided to acquire the item. This should cover smaller businesses that may not have formal purchasing processes that involve creating various documents.

These requirements are necessary but not sufficient conditions for an item to be eligible for depreciation loading. Regardless of whether they are met, the Commissioner can challenge whether a person had in fact decided on or before 20 May 2010 to purchase or construct at item.

#### _Treatment of improvements_

The Act makes a consequential amendment to section EE 37(3) to reflect the new grandparenting rule. This section provides that, if a person makes an improvement to an asset to which loading still applies, that improvement (being treated as a separate item) is eligible for loading if it meets the criteria of the amended grandparenting rule. If it does not meet the requirements, the improvement will not qualify for loading.

**Example 1**

In 2007 Electric Co embarked on a large-scale project to build a new hydro-electric dam which was due to be completed in January 2011. The project involves the construction and purchasing of many different components that, once complete, will form a single item of depreciable property (the dam). As at 20 May 2010, $60 million in costs had been incurred out of a total budget of $75 million but contracts had not yet been entered into for all of the remaining work.

In this case, the dam is eligible for depreciation loading. While as at 20 May 2010 Electric Co had not entered into contracts for all of the remaining work, it is clear that there was a firm decision to build the dam and that Electric Co had incurred expenditure in relation to it.

**Example 2**

Widget Co uses highly specialised production lines to produce its widgets. They build the construction lines themselves as they cannot be sourced externally. On 15 February 2010, Widget Co's board decided that a new production line should be made. Work started on the new line on 25 February and was expected to finish mid-July. As the line was being built internally no contracts were entered into for its construction.

As at 20 May 2010 the line was not complete and Widget Co's staff continued to work on it and purchase additional supplies as required.

The production line is eligible for depreciation loading in this situation. It is clear that Widget Co had decided on or before 20 May that it would build that production line and that expenditure had been incurred on producing the line. The board minutes should satisfy the administrative requirements and the invoices for the various components would be evidence that expenditure had been incurred on or before 20 May 2010.

**Example 3**

In 2008 Company A embarked on a project to completely redesign and build its computer systems. The project was split into four work streams; the first three were non-discretionary while the fourth depended on the outcome of the other three. Accordingly, Company A's board decided in 2008 that the first three streams would continue and that a decision would be made regarding the fourth in mid-2010.

Work began immediately on the first three streams. On 1 July 2010, Company A's board met and confirmed that the fourth work stream would proceed.

In this situation depreciation loading would apply to the first three work streams but not to the fourth. This is because Company A did not decide that the fourth stream would proceed until after 20 May 2010.

On the other hand, if the board had decided to proceed with the fourth stream on or before 20 May 2010 but work did not begin until after 20 May, it may be eligible for loading. This would depend on how closely related the streams are. For example, if they all relate to the same software package it is likely the expenditure on the first three streams would be "in relation to" the fourth stream and it would be eligible for loading. However, if they were for completely different software packages then it is unlikely that the expenditure on one stream would be "in relation to" another.

**Example 4**

When Company A's board originally decided to upgrade its computer systems, it was informed that the new software would not run on the company's current servers. The board therefore decided to upgrade its servers and allocated funds in the project's budget for this to occur, but due to the long timeframes for the software's development, contracts for the servers were not entered into until after 20 May 2010.

The servers would be eligible for depreciation loading in this situation because the expenditure on the software is in relation to the hardware. The software would not operate effectively without the server upgrade and the decision to upgrade was made on or before 20 May 2010.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 20 May 2010.

Depreciation rates
==================

2006 legislation amends the previous tax depreciation rules. The most significant changes are to the way that economic rates are set by the Commissioner.

_Sections EE 25, EE 25B, EE 25C, EE 25D, EE 25E, EE 26B, EE 31, EE 37, EE 58, EZ 21B, GC 6, and Schedule 11B of the Income Tax Act 2004, sections 91 AAF(1) and 91 AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section EG 16 of the Income Tax Act 1994_

The Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 amends the previous tax depreciation rules. The most significant changes are to the way that economic rates are set by the Commissioner.

Economic rates are part of the process that the Commissioner must use when setting depreciation rates for items of plant or equipment and buildings. Economic rates for buildings are now worked out using a straightline method, with a diminishing value equivalent. For most items of plant or equipment, economic rates are now calculated used the double declining balance method, with a straight-line equivalent.

There has also been a change to the value at which capital purchases can be expensed. To reduce business compliance costs, the low-value asset thresholds increase from $200 to $500. The higher thresholds are intended to reduce the number of low-value purchases that must be capitalised and depreciated.

### Background

Depreciation is an allowance to take account of the fact that assets used in a business eventually wear out or become out of date, even though they are maintained and repaired. This decline in value is recognised for tax purposes by allowing a deduction against income for each income year that the asset is used in the business.

A 2004 issues paper, Repairs and maintenance of the tax depreciation rules, examined a number of issues relating to the tax depreciation rules. The issues paper concluded that while the depreciation rules were generally sound, a number of changes would make the depreciation rules more neutral. A key change was to the method used to calculate economic rates because of concerns that it created an unintended investment bias favouring investment in longer-lived assets.

### Application dates

New methods for calculating economic rates apply to depreciable assets from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. The new methods apply to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and to buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005.

### Key features

There is no change to the way depreciation rates are calculated for fixed-life intangible property or excluded depreciable property. The changes only apply to plant or equipment and buildings.

#### Plant and equipment

Economic rates for short-lived plant and equipment are now more consistent with those applying to longer-lived plant and equipment. Rates for shorter-lived equipment are calculated using the double declining balance method. The result is higher economic rates for shorter-lived plant and equipment, with no increase in rates for longer-lived assets.

The new double declining balance method does not apply to some types of aircraft, cars, taxis, and minibuses, unless the motor vehicle is used for short-term hire. The double declining balance method also does not apply to plant and equipment that is expected to have a scrap or residual value greater than 13.5% of cost. Economic rates for these assets are set under separate rules.

The new methods of calculating the economic rate applies to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and from 2005-06 onwards.

#### Buildings

Economic rates for buildings are calculated using the straight-line method. An equivalent diminishing value rate can also be used. These rules apply to buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005 and from the 2005-06 and subsequent income years.

#### Low-value asset thresholds

To reduce some of the compliance costs to business having to maintain fixed-asset registers, the low-value asset thresholds increase from $200 to $500. Purchases of capital assets that cost equal to or less than $500 will be able to be expensed in the year in that the expenditure is incurred. The idea is to reduce the number of assets that businesses must annually account for on their fixed-asset registers. The increase applies to assets acquired on or after 19 May 2005.

### Detailed analysis

The amendments alter the way that economic rates are calculated rather than changing the basic structure of the tax depreciation rules. The changes do not change the way that tax depreciation rates are calculated for fixed-life intangible property.

### Application dates - section EE 25

The changes do not alter economic rates for assets acquired before 1 April 2005, in the case of plant or equipment, and before 19 May 2005 in the case of buildings. The changes apply from 1 April 2005 for plant or equipment and after 19 May 2005 for a building and from the 2005-06 year onwards. A number of limited concessions have been provided in the legislation that affect the general application dates. These relate to an election to use the old rates for plant and equipment purchased before the 2006-07 year and to building purchases and transfers in certain circumstances.

### The methods of setting economic rates - sections EE 25B to EE 25E

There are now four methods of calculating the economic rate. The new rates apply from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. The new methods apply to plant and equipment purchased on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired after 19 May 2005. Each method and the assets to which it applies are discussed in more detail below.

#### Economic rates for plant or equipment - section EE 25B

Section EE 25B sets the economic rate for an item of plant or equipment with a residual value of less than or equal to 13.5% of cost. Taxpayers should not use this section to work out economic depreciation rates for items of depreciable property that are: aeroplanes (excluding aeroplanes used for top-dressing or spraying); fixedlife intangible property; excluded depreciable property; buildings; cars, taxis, and minibuses (unless it is not available for short-term hire of less than one month); or plant or equipment that has a residual value greater than 13.5% of cost.

The rate that the Commissioner initially calculates is a diminishing value rate, which is rounded to the nearest banded rate. The banded diminishing value rate and the equivalent straight-line rate are set out in Schedule 11B.

A taxpayer acquiring an item of plant and equipment on or after 1 April 2005 and in their 2005-06 or subsequent income year, must use the economic depreciation rate calculated by the formula in section EE 25B(5). To work out this rate a taxpayer enters the estimated useful life of the asset into the double declining balance formula. The formula is expressed as 2/estimated useful life. The Commissioner's assessment of an asset's useful life, and any residual value, should be contained in determinations on depreciable assets.

Example

The estimated useful life of a helicopter is 20 years and 4 years for a laptop computer. Both have residual values of 13.5% or less. The diminishing value economic rate for each type of asset will be 2/20 = 10% and 2/4 = 50% respectively. The corresponding straight-line equivalent rates given by Schedule 11B are 7% and 40%.

Depreciation loading is added to the economic rate to work out the annual depreciation rate for a new item of plant and equipment. Assets that do not qualify for depreciation loading are items that have previously been held or used as depreciable property in New Zealand, buildings, imported used cars and international aircraft. For these assets, the banded economic rate equals the depreciation rate. For assets with estimated useful lives of less than two years, the total depreciation deduction is limited to the assets' cost because of sections EE 14(1) and EE 15.

#### Economic rates for buildings - section EE 25C

Section EE 25C sets the economic rate for an item of depreciable property that is a building.

"Building" is not a defined term in the Income Tax Act 2004. Guidance on whether a structure is considered a building is given in Inland Revenue's depreciation guides. The Commissioner is undertaking a project to more clearly define a building.

The Commissioner initially calculates the straight-line economic rate for a building. This is rounded to the nearest banded straight-line rate for buildings and the equivalent diminishing value rate is set out in Schedule 11B.

Generally, a taxpayer acquiring a building after 19 May 2005 must in their 2005-06 and subsequent income years use the economic rate calculated by the formula in section EE 25C(4). However, there are two exceptions to this rule. These relate to contracts to purchase buildings signed before 19 May 2005 and transfers of buildings between associated persons. These are discussed in more detail below in _Exceptions to the general application dates_.

The formula for the straight-line economic rate is 1/estimated useful life. The Commissioner has worked out an estimate of the useful life for each type of building. Again, these are contained in Determination DEP 1.

Example

The estimated useful life of a rental property is 50 years. The straight-line economic rate for this building will be 1/50 = 2%. Schedule 11B provides the corresponding diminishing value equivalent rate of 3%.

#### Economic rates for certain aircraft and types of motor vehicle - section EE 25D

Section EE 25D sets the economic rate for items of depreciable property that are types of aircraft or types of motor vehicle. This section arose out of concerns that applying the double declining balance method to these types of assets would result in overly generous economic rates.

This section sets the economic rate for fixed-wing aircraft used in New Zealand, excluding aircraft used for topdressing or spraying, gliders (as aircraft must be selfpropelled), international aircraft and helicopters. It also applies to motor vehicles designed exclusively or mainly to carry 12 or fewer people. This includes cars, minibuses and taxis. It does not include motor vehicles used for short-term hire (less than one month) which have their economic rates worked out under section EE 25B.

The economic rates for domestic aircraft are 10% diminishing value and 7% straight-line. For passengercarrying motor vehicles, the rates are 30% diminishing value and 21% straight-line.

Since the legislation was passed, the Minister of Revenue has announced that amendments will be made to the section EE 25D to clarify those assets that have their economic rates set under this section. These changes are proposed to apply from the 2005-06 year.

#### Economic rates for plant or equipment with residual values greater than 13.5% of cost - section EE 25E

Section EE 25E sets the diminishing value economic rate for items of plant or equipment that are estimated to have residual values greater than 13.5% of cost. This section allows the Commissioner to avoid setting overly generous economic rates for such plant or equipment.

Example

The Commissioner estimates that international oceangoing yachts have an estimated useful life of six years. They are typically sold at the end of six years for an amount equal to 40% of original cost. Applying this formula in section EE 25E (1 - (40/100)1/6 = 14%) the economic rate is 15% when rounded to the nearest banded diminishing value rate in Schedule 11. The straight-line equivalent rate is 10%.

If the section EE 25B formula had been applied, the diminishing value economic rate would have been 30%, which is out of line with the reduction in value suffered by the business.

### Exceptions to the general application dates

There are a number of exceptions to the general application dates. Each of these exceptions is discussed below.

#### Election to calculate economic rates in accordance with the old rules - section EE 26B

The legislation was not enacted until April 2006. This section allows a taxpayer to elect to apply the old depreciation rates to plant or equipment purchased on or after 1 April 2005 and before the beginning of their 2006-07 income year. Under this section, a taxpayer can avoid the cost of having to adjust tax depreciation rates for these assets if they have used the earlier method of setting the economic rate to calculate tax depreciation deductions for the 2005-06 income year. Requiring all taxpayers to go back and adjust depreciation rates on these assets could impose a significant compliance cost.

Therefore, section EE 26B allows a taxpayer to elect in their 2005-06 return the old method of calculating the economic rates for plant or equipment purchased on or after 1 April 2005 and before the beginning of their 2006-07 income year. Using this election results in economic rates for these assets being calculated in accordance with section EZ 21B and not sections EE 25B, EE 25D, or EE 25E. If such an election has been made, these assets must continue to be depreciated according to the old economic rates until they are sold, scrapped or are no longer used by the business.

Example

A standard balance taxpayer purchases $1 million worth of plant and equipment during the 2005-06 income year. At the end of each month, new purchases are entered into the firm's asset register and the then current law applied to work out depreciation deductions. To avoid the cost of having to go back and re-calculate economic rates for all the plant and equipment purchased during the 2005-06 year, the taxpayer elects to continue to use the old method of calculating economic rates for these assets and must continue to depreciate these assets on this basis for subsequent income years.

Purchases of plant or equipment made on or after the start of a taxpayer's 2006-07 income year must have their economic rate worked out under either sections EE 25B, EE 25D or EE 25E.

#### Binding contracts to purchase a building signed before 19 May 2005 - section EE 25C

The old economic rate method in section EZ 21B is used if a binding contract to purchase or construct a building was entered into before 19 May 2005. However, if the building or the ownership interest in a building yet to be built is subsequently on-sold, section EE 25C applies because the building would be a new acquisition.

Example

As at 18 May 2005, Bravo Limited has a binding contract with Building Co Limited to build a new 10,000 sq metre head office. The building is scheduled to be finished in May 2006. Because the contract was entered into before 19 May 2005, the earlier method of working out the economic rate applies once the building is available for use. In April 2006, Bravo Limited sells the nearly completed building. The new building owner must calculate the building's economic rate according to the formula in section EE 25C.

#### Transfer of buildings and limited concessions - section EZ 21B

Section EZ 21B saves the old method for calculating an asset's economic rate for assets purchased before these changes were made. It also provides a number of concessions that preserve the old higher economic rates in certain limited circumstances for building transfers.

The transfer of a building to another person that takes place on or after 19 May 2005 will generally mean that the new owner has a lower economic rate for the building that the previous owner. However, the law provides for two exceptions to this general principle.

The first is in the case of transfers between companies where there is 100% common ownership. In the case of a building that is transferred from one company within a wholly-owned group to another company within the same group, the economic rate is worked out in accordance with section EZ 21B. The result is no change in the building depreciation rate.

Example

Bravo Limited wholly owns four other companies, Alpha, Charlie, Delta, and Echo. They are planning to re-organise the group and create a new company, Foxtrot Limited, to manage and administer the group's properties. The restructuring is set to occur at the beginning of the 2008 income year. Because section EZ 21B applies to buildings transferred within a wholly owned group of companies, the previous method of calculating economic rates applies. The result is no change to the building's depreciation rate.

The savings provision also applies to individuals when the building transferred is relationship property. This means that the economic rate for a building transferred between wives and husbands, de facto partners or same-sex partners is worked out according to EZ 21B.

Example

In 2004, Ben and Jen purchased a one-bedroom apartment and rented this out. Ben is killed in an accident in early 2006. Jen receives Ben's interest in the rental property. Under the savings provision, Jen can still use the earlier economic rate, meaning no change to the building depreciation rate for the one-bedroom apartment.

### Deductions for low-value assets - section EE 31 and section EG 16(1)

New sections EE 31(1) and (1B) have been inserted to give effect to the increase in the low-value asset threshold from $200 to $500. The new $500 threshold applies for the cost of assets acquired on or after 19 May 2005. There are no other changes to the previous low-value asset rules.

Taxpayers can claim a deduction for the cost of assets purchased for $500 or less provided that:

*   they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies, unless the entire purchase costs is equal to or less than $500; and
*   the assets will not become part of a larger item of depreciable property - for example, expenditure on material to build a new wall in the taxpayer's factory; and
*   the costs of those assets are not deductible under another provision of the Act.

Section EG 16 in the Income Tax Act 1994 has also been amended so that late-balance date taxpayers can take advantage of the increased thresholds.

### Commissioner's power to deny a deduction - section GC 6

Section GC 6 denies a depreciation deduction if the Commissioner is of the opinion that certain arrangements have been entered into to allow a taxpayer to obtain a depreciation deduction contrary to the intent of the Act. This section could be applied when taxpayers sell and reacquire assets in order to obtain the benefit of the higher depreciation rates.

### Other changes

Sections 91 AAF and 91 AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to reflect the changes to the methods used to calculate economic rates. These changes allow the Commissioner to consider and select the most appropriate method of calculating an asset's economic rate when making a determination about an asset's depreciation rate.

Section EE 38 has been amended so that nil or negative consideration is allowed for the purpose of sections EE 41 to EE 44. Inserting subsection (1B) in section EE 38 means that all asset disposal costs are deductible in full. These costs can be significant if an asset has no scrap value. For example, Resource Management Act consents sometimes require demolition costs to be incurred when the asset is no longer used. Allowing a deduction for the cost of demolition and disposal is the economically correct outcome. This change may remove an artificial impediment to more environmentally friendly asset disposal practices. This change applies to asset disposals from the 2005-06 income year.

Section EE 58 is amended to include references to the new sections EE 25B to EE 25E in the definition of "economic rate".

An error in section EE 41(3), which excluded buildings from the depreciation claw-back provisions in section EE 41(1), has been corrected by replacing the reference to "section" in EE 41(3) to "subsection (2)". This has effect from the 2005-06 and later tax years.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

This adjustment applies to if you have sold a building you claimed depreciation on in the income years before 2004.

If you sold a building you had claimed depreciation on or before 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You may need to adjust your income for Working for Families or student loan if you sell a building that was used for a business or rental, and have included the depreciation recovered in your taxable income.

For 2003 and earlier years, you were:

*   not allowed to claim depreciation on buildings as a deduction in your income for Working for Families
*   not required to include any depreciation recovered on the sale of a building as Working for Families income.

If you recovered any depreciation from the sale of a building that you claimed depreciation on in 2003 and earlier years, then leave this out of your income for calculating your Working for Families entitlements or your student loan repayment obligation.

If your business was running at a loss before 2004
--------------------------------------------------

You will need to make an adjustment unless the business income was in a loss (for example, not included in the income for Working for Families) in the year the depreciation was claimed.

If you claimed depreciation on a building between 2004 and 2011
---------------------------------------------------------------

Depreciation on buildings was allowed as a deduction from income for Working for Families purposes from 2004 to 2011. This means you include the recovery of the depreciation claimed as income.

In the examples we have only shown 2 years to demonstrate the overall affect.

Example 1 - Building sold in 2015

#### Income in 2003

*   business income $27,300
*   less depreciation claimed on a building $2,300
*   business income on IR3 (after $2,300 deduction for depreciation) $25,000

#### Income in 2004

*   business income $25,000
*   less depreciation claimed on a building $2,100
*   business income on IR3 (after $2,100 deduction for depreciation) $25,000

#### Income in 2015 - when adjustments for depreciation were made in 2003 and earlier years

| Year | Depreciation  <br>claimed | Adjustment  <br>made in year |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2003 | $2,300 | $2,300 |
| 2004 | $2,100 | $0  |
| business income from IR3 return (includes $4,400 depreciation recovered when building sold) |     | $29,400 |
| less depreciation recovery (claimed in 2003). The $2,100 claimed in 2004 is not deducted here, because it was not added back in 2004. |     | $2,300 |
| Income for Working for Families |     | $27,100 |

Example 2

Ben has a commercial rental property that he decides to sell. His taxable income for the 2015 year is $250,000. The total depreciation recovered from the sale is $100,000.

Ben claimed depreciation of $60,000 in the 2003 and earlier tax years and $40,000 in the 2004 to 2011 tax years.

He should reduce his income for Working for Families for the year ending 31 March 2015 by $60,000.

**Business Basics - Depreciation** [More information](#)

#### Visual

The video title Business Basics Depreciation slides in from the left.

The title slides to the right of the screen and is replaced by a person sitting at a desk with a laptop. File folders, a desk lamp and a mug also appear on the table. A clock ticks on the wall. 3 lights hang from the roof and there is a potted plant on both sides of the desk.

Two circles appear above the person’s head, 1 has a dollar symbol in the middle of it, the other a calculator.

#### Audio

**Music**

Easy listening style music plays throughout the entire video.

**Narrator**

Depreciation is one of those things you’ll become familiar with once you’re in business.

In this video, we explain what it is and how you calculate it.

* * *

#### Visual

A computer screen is sitting on a desk, a forklift with 2 boxes on the forks and van also appear suggesting assets a business may own. A circle with a dollar symbol inside it appears above each asset.

A downward arrow appears next to each dollar symbol showing depreciation is a loss on the assets value.

A big circle appears with an income tax return in the middle. Two circles with dollar symbols appear on the tax return, 1 is smooth and represents gross income, the other is spikey and represents expenses. The expenses are removed from the gross income.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Assets, otherwise known as substantial things businesses own, mostly lose value over time as they get older.

This loss of value is called depreciation.

Businesses claim depreciation loss as a deduction expense each tax year.

You treat depreciation like an expense and deduct it from your gross income when you do your income tax return.

* * *

#### Visual

Andie is waving to the camera. A sign “Andie’s plastic moulding” appears at the top left of the screen.

A plastic moulding machine slides in from the right. A horizontal timeline appears above the machine with “12 months” displayed above that showing it will last longer than 12 months. $5,000+ appears on the machine showing it cost more than this so is not a low-value asset.

The timeline is replaced by a circle with a dollar symbol and downward arrow in it. A calendar appears showing the month of March and 31 is highlighted.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Meet Andie.

Andie’s got a plastic moulding business with assets.

Let’s talk about depreciation with Andie’s new machine, new computer, and old truck.

Andie has just bought a new moulding machine for her factory.

As it is likely to last longer than 12 months and cost over 5,000 dollars, she knows she can depreciate the machine at the end of the tax year, that’s the thirty-first of March.

* * *

#### Visual

Two circles appear, 1 has “Diminishing value” inside it, the other has “Straight line method”. Graphs appear next to each circle.

The diminishing value graph curves downward from left to right. Dollar symbols appear on the graph, starting big at the left and decreasing in size to the right. This shows depreciation starts out big but reduces each year.

The straight line method graph is a straight line from left to right. Dollar symbols appear on the graph, and remain the same size from left to right. This shows depreciation is the same each year it is claimed.

A laptop appears showing the Diminishing value depreciation rate is 13%, and the Straight line method depreciation rate is 8.5%.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Depreciation rates are based on the expected life of the asset.

In most cases, you can choose either a diminishing value or straight line method to calculate depreciation.

If Andie chooses diminishing value, she can claim a bigger deduction in the first year, but the deductions will get smaller in later years, and it will take longer to fully depreciate the machine.

If she chooses straight line, she’ll claim the same amount each year and the machine will be depreciated much quicker.

Andie uses our online depreciation rate resource and finds plastic moulding machines have a diminishing value rate of 13% and a straight line rate of 8.5%.

It’s up to Andie which option she prefers.

* * *

#### Visual

Back at Andie’s business a computer is shown on a deck with “$800” above it. The income tax return circle appears indicating Andie is claiming the full value of the computer as an expense in the year she bought it as it’s a low-value asset.

A van slides in from the left with a dollar symbol and downward arrow above it showing depreciation can be claimed on private assets introduced to the business. A circle appears with an independent valuation report inside it.

A computer screen appears. A circle with a dollar symbol in it appears next to the screen. The screen turns into a circle with a dollar symbol in it. Then the 2 circles merge comparing the sale price to the adjusted book value. An upward arrow shows a gain is taxable, a downward arrow shows a loss is a deductible expense.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Andie also bought a computer, it was only 800 dollars.

Since it’s classed as a low-value asset, Andie can deduct the full cost of it in the year she purchases it, instead of having to spread the cost over the life of the computer.

If you already own an asset and introduce it into your business, you can claim depreciation on the market value of the asset.

The best way to determine market value of assets you want to depreciate is to get an independent valuation.

Make sure you keep a record of any valuation you obtain.

If you then sell the asset, you compare the sales price to the asset's adjusted book value in your fixed asset register.

Any gain is taxable, and any loss is deductible.

* * *

#### Visual

A valuation of “$500” appears in a circle for Andie’s truck. A newspaper clipping with $600 appears in a circle next to the valuation showing Andie is selling her truck.

The circles merge and an income tax return appear in the new circle. “+$100” appears over the gross income showing Andie includes the profit as taxable income. “-$200” then appears over the expenses to show this as a deduction claimed if the truck sold for only $300.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Back to Andie.

Andie received a valuation of 500 dollars for her truck from a local dealership.

Andie then decides to sell her truck.

She puts an ad in the paper and sells it for 600 dollars.

The truck had an adjusted tax value of 500 dollars, so Andie includes the 100 dollar gain as income in her tax return.

If the truck had sold for 300 dollars, that would have been a loss of 200 dollars that Andie could have claimed in her tax return.

Deputy Commissioner for business transformation
===============================================

Our Business Transformation Deputy Commissioner Greg James shares his insights on the transformation journey.

Transformation vs change
------------------------

Transformational change is not a single change event. Nor is it incremental.

It is a set of major changes for customers and employees where the impact is both wide and deep.

Transformational change is more than just technology and digital disruption, it can be a once-in-a generation opportunity to reinvent and to grow.

The key differences between change and transformation are:

| Change | Transformation |
| --- | --- |
| Shorter term | Multi year |
| Limited number of systems | All systems – policy, process, people and customers |
| Narrow and shallow | All of organisation |
| Policy or process or people | Fundamental rethink |
| Driver for change generally comes from within the organisation | Driver for change generally comes from within the organisation |
| Incremental improvement with small gap between current and future states | Wide and deep |
|     | Catch up or leap forward with a large gap between current and future states |

Business models must be underpinned by:

*   modern technologies
*   systemic process improvements
*   new, flexible, and agile ways of working
*   scaling of digital customer channels inherent in digital transformation.

But these things alone do not define a transformation.

Although transformations take a long time from start to finish, they need to run at pace, with clear deliverables along the way to show progress and build confidence. To avoid failing or being downsized, spend time understanding why the good transformations do not fail and look to repeat that success.

If you are a government agency, get multi-year funding – this is non-negotiable!

Coexistence as you transform
----------------------------

Transformational change is multi-year and must co-exist alongside business-as-usual activity. The need to coexist with the old world as you build the new world is immediate.

If you are a government agency you will have the added challenge of coexisting with the Government of the day. Ministers will want, or may need, to make changes to your transformation. You must work closely with your Minister to build the change into your programme, to reduce risk around delivery and avoid confusion over changes to previously published outcomes. Coexistence is not just about technology, it is also about people, processes, and the organisational change. All of this creates complexity and adds to oversight, governance, and management. This is by far one of, if not the most difficult challenge faced by many transformations.

Our people
----------

Transformative changes are disruptive and at times emotionally tough on your people – the soft stuff is the hard stuff.

Tensions between wide-ranging stakeholders means you will inevitably disappoint some along the way. It’s not going to be a popularity contest.

The culture of the organisation can be a block. Use less jargon and be pragmatic but expect that it’s going to be hard to win the trust of your people.

Change management 101 tells us that you need to repeat the same messages 100s of times and even then, do not expect that everyone will see it in the same way.

Some people may never buy in, and it can often be the ones that have given undivided loyalty in the past.

Understand and respect the past but focus on the future.

Greg's insights for delivery
============================

Show all

Pre-delivery

### Leadership

You must have a CEO that understands the size of transformational change and is prepared to lead from the top.

The CEO must lead, and success will require the strength of leaders to hold their nerve through constant resistance and the high-risk demands before them.

Start with the assumption that most executives have experienced change, but they have not experienced 'transformational change'.

You need to consider if you have the right team at the top as these are not easy journeys.

The executive team must be on the same page. If they are not, then you may need to let some go gracefully.

Executive teams will need to devote significant time to the transformation journey. It is not something that can be delegated.

Bring transformational experience to the top table. It requires specific experience, and whilst good executives can and will learn on the way, asking them to lead from the start increases the risk of failure.

You also need to bring transformational change expertise into your wider programme. Hire a team of experts to augment the internal teams - this is essential as you need experience on your side of the table.

You can and will partner up with external consultancies, but you must understand that they are working for their company, not yours!

### Planning

The right methods, plans, foundations and skills

Establish clear methods - a 'one-size-fits-all' will not work in most instances. Be prepared to adapt and mix things up to get the right blend.

Make sure your plans are at the right level and make them fit for purpose. No one understands multi-thousand-line plans so spend time on getting this right.

Be clear about what you need to do and when you need to do it. Plan, plan, plan and then plan some more.

Establish very strong programme foundations. You will need a strong Programme Management Office (PMO) and the right foundation framework and method, such as the 10 keys for reporting.

Build stakeholder trust. Be transparent and invest time in understanding each of your stakeholder groups. Build relationships and be clear about outcomes even if at times it is not what they want to hear.

Invest time in bringing the executive along on the journey - do not underestimate the size of the education process.

### Key decisions

Find the key decisions that need to be made, for example:

*   What is your overarching strategy?
*   What is the target operating model you are looking to establish?
*   What significant changes do you wish to see in the new organisation?
*   Build or buy?
*   System integration if needed. Who will do this, you or a partner?
*   What do you want out of your transformation partners?
*   How are you going to measure their performance?
*   How are you going to measure your own performance?

Establish an early view of the transformational stages or phase that you will need to get to the end. You will not or cannot know everything up front given that you are embarking on a multiyear programme. So make sure your stages are broad enough in definition to allow you to adjust when you are on the journey.

Establish blueprints and plans for each area of transformation.

Make sure you have good commercial skills in your core transformation team and make sure that you create robust commercial practices and processes.

You need to build the story as you go, and linking your delivery, to your strategy and blueprints that will help people understand how the transformation activities fit together.

Delivery

### The right people

Make sure you have the best and brightest of your people embedded in the transformational programme. They should be your future leaders.

Make sure that your programme is set up to educate these people as you go, they will be the ones there at the end to take the organisation forward.

### Plan at each stage of delivery

At the start of each phase of delivery, spend time working out the scope and the cost to deliver. Scope needs to be built together with the business groups affected by that phase of delivery.

Once you have the scope and cost worked out, lock the plans. Only allow change through a formal change control process.

Drive a programme culture of transparency, so that when things go wrong (which they will) you have not established a blame culture. You want people to come forward with problems when they see them, not after they have spent a lot of time trying to resolve them.

### Risk and issues management

Risk and issues management is critical during delivery. You need to ensure that:

*   your process for managing risk and issues is visible
*   your people are accountable to mitigate any risks and issues
*   activities are measured
*   action dates are meet.

Too often risk and issue management becomes a shelfware exercise.

### Review and improve along the way

Lessons learned need to be reviewed at the start of each phase and put into practice, with a formal lesson-learned process to be completed at the end of each phase. Be prepared to learn and adjust and continue to get better.

Be clear about how you are going to measure the success of each phase.

No matter how good your design process is, be prepared for surprises.

Make sure your governance is fit for purpose and adaptive to the changing nature of your programme.

Having independent people on your governance board helps to make sure you are not captured by internal groupthink.

Plan to be successful. Practice your cut-over as much as you can and test, test, and test.

Expose your solution designs early and test them with your wider business.

### Organisational design

Organisational design and work on the operating model needs to be started early with your executive team.

Organisational design will impact leaders at all levels – understand what’s top of mind at all levels. Provide clarity on the impacts as soon as possible - its people’s lives you are dealing with.

As you go through your delivery phases make sure you start planning for how your organisation will manage life after transformation. You will most likely have had a big reliance on your transformational programme team so you will need to build a transition path to future change.

Enterprise Level 1 Mega Process (Process Grouping) Thislevel definesdifferent views of how processes are structured to deliverthe business focus at Level 1. Processes may be structured from an end-to-end perspective in a given function (e.g. Collection & Revenue Management)or as an end-to-end value chain across organisational boundaries. Business Group (E.g. PF&F, or Service Delivery) Level 2 Major Process (Core Process) Comprises of process groups that are defined in detail in the business process flows at Level 3. These are normally carried out within a business unit or line of business & defines those activities that deliver desired outcomes to the business. Business Unit (E.g. Customer Services, or Collections) Level 3 Process (Business Process Flow) Contains process flows & describes the sequence or flow between sub processes. Each process at this level must add value to the business or be an essential requirement. Wherever possible, these processes will be product, customer & channel agnostic. Business Unit Team (E.g. Call Centre) Level 4 Sub Process (Operational Process Flow) This level defines in more detail the business process flows defined at Level 3. It includes detailed sub-process design with links to written procedures, business rules, application functions & technology. This level includes product variants & exception/error handling activities. Team (E.g. CSR team 1) Level 5 Activity (Detailed Process Flow) This provides further detail for the operational process flows & is specific to an individual operational role.

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Design Review Workshop Child Support 26 – 28 January 2021 Executive Summary \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Background - 2 - The Business Transformation Design Review Workshop ran between 26-28 January 2021, with 31 end users from the CCS-I Families segment, two Technical Specialists, two Community Compliance officers and two representatives from II&S.The purpose of the workshop was to seek their input into the design for START Stage 4 release 2. Over the three days, attendees were broken into groups of 12to participate in three separate deep- dives.These were structured around the systems and processes associated with: oRegistration and Assessment oInternational Collections oCollection and Payment In these sessions, attendees received an overview of the technical design, a walk through of the associated business process and were given the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in START. During each session we captured feedback, questions and thoughts on the following: oDesign(Confirmation, change, enhancements or gaps) oTesting(Areas identified for key focus) oBusiness Processes oChange Appendices 1-3 summarise the key themes and findings from each deep-dive. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] oGeneral approval of the changes across all three areas oGenuine excitement around the increase in automation quicker processing enabling swifter outcomes, specifically payments to receiving carers allowing more time to focus on the customer including chasing up themore difficult to collect debt particularly pleased to no longer interact with spreadsheets Most frequent comments: “simpler” “easier” “faster” for CSOs oSome concerns that automation would make the collections process too rigid to the detriment of customers oAppreciate the benefits of having one database showing all actions on a customer's account, giving greater accuracy with fewer inadvertent errors or impacts down the line oThe processes are seen as straightforward and based on common sense e.g. teams outside International felt they would be able to pick up the work quite easily oImprovements to myIR will make it an easier/faster process for customers to complete forms and paperwork correctly - leading to fewer phone calls o“Common sense” also applied to V12’s layout and user-friendly interface Key Takeaway Points – in summary - 3 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Soundbites: (The voice of the attendees.....captured during the days). o"Largescale transactional process being automated – this is a big win for us, it allows for moreengagement with our customers.” (Registration and Assessment) o“Thatthere is one database for all actions taken on a customer's account, will prevent officersmissing crucial information on changes to a customer's account that can have aroll-oneffectto othertaxtype s.” (Registration and Assessment) oDue to large amount of manual processing, we receive a lot of calls from Receiving Carers asking if theirpayment is on the schedule received from Australia because we receive the schedule some time before we make payment. In future we will be making the payment as soon as the schedule arrives so these calls will eventually disappear, and everyone was happy with that. (International Collections) oWith automatic arrears collections the payments to receiving carers will be processed promptly meaning less telephone contacts. (Collections and Payments) Feedback:(The voice of the attendee.....capturedpost workshop). o“I am so proud of the way everyone has pulled together and contributed to this incredible project. Each person presenting the information in the workshops was genuinely excited. I have already enthusiastically told my team about START R12's common sense layout and user-friendly interface.We're all really looking forward to seeing the changes rolled out. I was particularly impressed by the balanced way that ideas were openly considered but with the utmost care around risk management. Everyone was approachable and I was very grateful for a chance to be included in the discussions that will help to shape the future. Thank you!” o“I am excited to see the changes come into effect and ironing out the teething issues to provide our customers with consistent, concise information. Well done to the team who have managed to get such a complex tax type to fit the constraints of the "off the shelf" product and their willingness to take our suggestions on board to get it as close to right from the start that we can. I found this workshop very beneficial and wish all of our colleagues could have attended in some way, shape or form to experience our future as well.” Soundbites ”Absolutely taken aback by the awesome and exciting things ahead” - 4 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] APPENDIX - 5 - \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix 1 –Registration and Assessment - 6 - Design: oConfirmation – The attendees validate our confidence and ability to deliver and realise the benefits of what we are going to achieve. Key areas: oSimplification of processes, e.g. large scale transactional process being automated. oThe Oranga Tamariki portal (online) will have a number of functions that will help Oranga Tamariki staff who will have the ability to manage their clients: •Search for a specific children using the OT unique identifier. •Register for Child Support. •Ability to submit all requests that a Child Support receiving carer can e.g. change of circumstances •Extract reports e.g. overpayment report. oRecommended Changes - There were no specific call outs here. oGaps – There were no specific call outs here. Testing: oThe attendees were interested in the testing phases and how we test. Business Process: oIntegration of Child Support into START will result in Data conversion, e.g. what will be converted across from FIRST to START. Change: oAttendees were interested in how we implement any legislative changes. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix 2 –International Collections - 7 - Design: oConfirmation- Currently the International Collection work is undertaken by a specialist team in Hamilton and we had 6 staff attend from that team. The solution in START largely automates tasks which are currently performed manually using spreadsheets. The International people were extremely positive about the proposed solution.Happy to see the increased automation, they were particularly pleased to no longer interact with spreadsheets.Each of the three sessions was very interactive and the enthusiasm of the attendees was appreciated by the SMEs. oRecommended Changes- Valid feedback on how information is displayed in some of the cases demonstrated. This has been taken onboard and is being worked through by the SMEs oGaps -Indicator for customer living in Australia but Services Australia (SA) is not collecting CS, the customer is paying us directly (we had only designed indicator for when SA is collecting). oWe were advised that CS are unable to use the Section 17 work item in START and asked if it's being fixed. Action point taken to understand the issue and find a solution – we were not aware of any issues. o10 other minor suggestions regarding the case functionality that the SMEs noted to work through. Testing: Outlined the testing process to each session and no one seemed surprised. Business Process:Discussion about how much data we will convert – Agreed to take away and discuss with the business as we have not finalised the converted data discussion. Change: oCCS people not currently doing International Collections (in each session) felt they would be able to pick up this work.This is not just down to the automation but the way it’s been designed in START.A lot of complexity has been removed and instead, the process is straight forward and based on common sense. oIntercepts and resolution of a pain point: issue of customers going into myIR and changing from services Australia’s bank account to their own bank account and then receiving payments incorrectly. With intercepts being used for services Australia the customers bank account will not be changed to services australia’s bank account so this issue will be completely resolved. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Appendix 3 –Collections and Payments - 8 - Design: oConfirmation– Attendees were generally enthusiastic about the design presented to them. Most comment was around the benefits they would see as a result of automation of wage deductions for both ongoing and arrears and the impact that more timely payments to receiving carers would have on both customers and staff. Pain points associated to system limitations in FIRST (write offs of assessment debt) are removed meaning that staff have more options for giving relief to customers. oRecommended Changes– changing field and decode descriptions to make them more relevant to users and more consistent with the language use in letters and the website. Providing users with a view of the value of debt owed by a liable parent per receiving carer. oGaps –there were suggestions that we need to be careful that in automating collection actions we don’t become too rigid and deny customers flexibility in line with their circumstances. Testing: oAttendees reinforced the need to pre-test the next Annual Assessment run due for February 2022 as it will be first one we run in START. Business Process: oData conversion, this mainly centred around the level of conversion of notes information from FIRST which staff see as vital for many collections processes. Change: oTraining was of some concern to staff who felt that it could take some time to adjust to the new financials posted by START, particularly in liable parent accounts.

This Determination sets out the diminishing value amortisation rates (depreciation like deductions) that the Commissioner has determined for each horticultural plant that is listed in the schedule to this Determination.

A 10% amortisation rate, which does not include the 20% loading, applies to most other horticultural plants that are not included in the schedule to this Determination.

For those horticultural plants listed in the schedule to this Determination, taxpayers who have furnished their 2005 income returns on or before 30 June 2005 may elect to apply either the amortisation rate of 10% (plus a 20% loading) or the amortisation rate(s) as set out in column 2 of the schedule to this Determination. This option is also available to all affected taxpayers for the 2004 income year.

**Estimated useful life**  
The main element the Commissioner has taken into account to establish the amortisation rate for each listed horticultural plant is its estimated useful life. Where appropriate, the following have been taken into account in arriving at the amortisation rates of listed horticultural plants.

*   The main purpose for which a listed horticultural plant has been cultivated; and
*   The manner in which a listed horticultural plant is cultivated and managed.

The estimated useful life of a listed horticultural plant commences on the day of planting and continues until the plant might reasonably be expected to cease to be useful to a person in deriving income or carrying on a horticultural business.

The main factor that has been taken into account in calculating the estimated useful life of a listed horticultural plant is that it has passed its commercial "use-by" date. This, in essence, is due to the plant's age and the fact that it can no longer deliver an economic crop.

Other factors that have a significant impact on the estimated useful life of a listed horticultural plant have been taken into account. This includes such things as natural and incidental damage, decay, disease and exhaustion.

Inland Revenue has not taken into account any element where a specific deduction is provided for in the legislation. This includes replacement plantings, or where a listed horticultural plant has ceased to exist or be used to derive income.

Crop management techniques, such as regeneration, topworking and reworking where trees are potentially cut back to their stumps, have also been taken into account in determining the estimated useful life of listed horticultural plants. Where the process of topworking or reworking involves grafting a new variety on to the old root system, it is considered that a new plant has been established.

The estimated useful life of each listed horticultural plant has been established by Inland Revenue following extensive consultation with grower organisations and industry experts.

**Amortisation rates**  
The process adopted in arriving at the amortisation rates of listed horticultural plants commenced with the establishment of an appropriate level of estimated useful life for each listed plant. This data is then translated into an established straight line equivalent rate as set out in column 2 of Schedule 11 _Banded rate of depreciation_ of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004 (_Schedule 11_). The straight line equivalent rate in column 2 is further translated into an appropriate diminishing value depreciation rate as set out in column 1 of _Schedule 11_.

Where a listed horticultural plant's established straight line equivalent rate falls between two rates in column 2 of _Schedule 11_, a rounding process has been adopted whereby the rate is either rounded up or down. Where such a rate falls equally between two straight line equivalents, the rate is rounded up.

The amortisation rates listed in the schedule to this Determination have been established for the widest possible application. Where the estimated useful lives of the various species of a plant variety do not materially differ, only one amortisation rate has been established for that variety.

**Please note** that 20% is to be added to the rates shown for each listed horticultural plant in column 2 of the schedule to the Determination to arrive at the diminishing value amortisation rate available each income year.

**Application of this Determination to the 2004 and 2005 income years**

This Determination applies from the 2004 income year.

Most growers of horticultural plants included in this Determination should have already furnished their 2004 income returns when this Determination is promulgated. A few with early balance dates may also have filed their 2005 income returns.

Amortisation rates and replacement planting deductions claimed in those income returns furnished prior to the issue of this Determination should have been based on the previous rules that applied. Consequently, deductions for these items may be over or understated. The level of any adjustment depends on a number of factors. Some adjustments may not result in material changes to deductions already claimed. Whether any adjustment is material is to be based on the judgement of each grower.

Any requests to amend assessments are to be:

*   requested in writing; and
*   made for the income year where the adjustment arises; and
*   made at the **earlier** of when the next income return is furnished or the last day for furnishing that next return.

Growers will not be expected to follow the disputes resolution process to request these specific adjustments for the 2004 and early balance date 2005 income returns furnished on or before 30 June 2005.

Inland Revenue acknowledges that:

*   it may take some time for growers, their associations and advisers to familiarise themselves with this Determination and its effect on the deductions available to them; and
*   many of the adjustments may not be material and would not provide the most efficient use of Inland Revenue's resources; and
*   the reduction of growers' compliance costs is a primary consideration.

**To that end, for the 2004 (and 2005 income returns that have been furnished on or before 30 June 2005), it is possible to use the "old" amortisation rate at the taxpayer's election.** The Department will regard an election as having been made by a grower at the **later** of:

*   when their 2004 and/or 2005 income return(s) are furnished; or
*   when an amended assessment is requested for those income years. This date will be the **earlier** of:
    1.  when the next income return is furnished; or
    2.  the last day for furnishing that next income return.

**Additions of new amortisation rates/amendments to existing amortisation rates**

Where a horticultural plant has not been determined by the Commissioner as a listed horticultural plant, taxpayers may apply in writing to the Commissioner for a specific horticultural plant or category of horticultural plants to be so determined.

Changes may be made to the Determination from time to time by the Commissioner on receipt of written applications from grower organisations. Amendments may include adding further horticultural plants to those already listed, adjusting the estimated useful life of a horticultural plant or removing a plant that is no longer commercially grown. Amendments may be effective for the current or future income years. They will not apply to retrospective income years.

Amendments to this Determination will be made by the Commissioner issuing supplementary Determinations pursuant to subsection 91AAB(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Applications for changes must include the following information.

*   The nature of the amendment to the Determination being sought. This may be a new amortisation rate, amend an existing amortisation rate or remove an existing amortisation rate.
*   Applicant's details. This includes full name, IRD number (if applicable), address, land line telephone number, fax number, cell phone number and the contact person for enquiries.
*   Horticultural plant information. This includes:
    1.  describing the horticultural plant;
    2.  the income year the change is requested to apply from (amendments may be effective for the current or future income years), they will not be made to retrospective income years;
    3.  the reasons for requesting to amend the Determination (adding further horticultural plants to those already listed, adjusting the estimated useful life of a horticultural plant due to a change or removing a plant that is no longer commercially grown);
    4.  the organisation's detailed assessment of the plant's estimated useful life (this is to include any evidence to support that assessment);
    5.  A detailed assessment by an independent industry expert of the plant's estimated useful life (this is to include any evidence to support that assessment).

The application process for a horticultural plant to be determined as a listed horticultural plant or to amend the amortisation rate for an existing listed horticultural plant is summarised in the flowchart attached as appendix "A".

Applications for changes to the Determination are to be sent to:

### COMMENTARY ON DETERMINATION DET 05/02

### AMORTISATION RATES FOR LANDFILL CELL CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURE

**Introduction**

This commentary does not form part of the Determination. It is intended to provide assistance in the understanding and application of the Determination.

This Determination sets out the amortisation rates (depreciation-like deductions) that the Commissioner has determined for each of the types of landfill cell construction expenditure that is listed in the schedule to this Determination (referred to in this commentary as "listed landfill cell construction expenditure").

Taxpayers who meet the criteria under section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and have incurred the listed landfill cell construction expenditure in an income year starting on or after 10 June 2005, are required to elect to apply either the amortisation rate of 63.5% (diminishing value depreciation rate) or 63.5% (straight-line equivalent).

This Determination does not apply to types of expenditure that are not listed in the schedule to this Determination.

This Determination and this commentary also appear in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005).

**Criteria under section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004**

A taxpayer meets the criteria under section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 if:

*   the taxpayer carries on a business in New Zealand ; and
*   the taxpayer incurs, in the business, expenditure:
    *   that is of a type listed in schedule 6B of the Income Tax Act 2004, other than expenditure listed in part C of the schedule,
    *   that is not incurred in relation to revenue account property (other than land that is subject to section CB 6B of the Income Tax Act 2004), and
    *   that is not deductible under any other legislative provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 but for section DB 37.

**Estimated useful life**

The amortisation rate for listed landfill cell construction expenditure is based on:

*   the average planned filling time for commercial landfill cells in New Zealand, and
*   the average estimated economic life of commercial landfill cells in New Zealand.

Commercial landfill cells refer to landfill cells that are constructed by taxpayers in the waste management industry who meet the above criteria under section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004.

For the listed landfill cell construction expenditure, the estimated useful life begins once construction of the commercial landfill cell to which the expenditure relates has been completed and continues until the relevant landfill cell is filled and capped.

The average planned filling time of commercial landfill cells in New Zealand is approximately one year. However, there are operational factors, such as intermediate filling, which mean a commercial landfill cell can be open for more than one year.

The practice of intermediate filling affects the estimated economic life of commercial landfill cells. Intermediate filling refers to situations where a commercial landfill cell can only be filled to a certain level of the cell's capacity in the first year of operation. Intermediate filling may occur due to the size and/or depth of the landfill cell, topographical or other operational factors. Where intermediate filling is involved, the commercial landfill cell will have an estimated economic life longer than the planned filling time of one year.

Inland Revenue has taken into account the fact that even if intermediate filling is involved, most revenues will be derived from a commercial landfill cell in its first year of operation. Using a weighted-average, Inland Revenue has generally applied more weight to the first year of a commercial landfill cell's operation as opposed to the later year(s) before the cell is fully filled and capped.

During the process of making this Determination, Inland Revenue has also taken into account the following matters, but decided that these matters do not significantly impact on the estimated useful life of a commercial landfill cell in New Zealand:

*   future development in waste management technologies and initiatives
*   landfill gas revenues derived from commercial landfill cells
*   the likelihood of reopening commercial landfill cells after they have been capped
*   non-commercial landfills, and
*   commercial landfills in overseas jurisdictions.

The estimated useful life of commercial landfill cells in this Determination has been established by Inland Revenue following extensive consultation with taxpayers in the waste management industry and industry experts.

**Amortisation rates**

The process adopted in arriving at the amortisation rates for listed landfill cell construction expenditure began with the establishment of an estimated useful life for the commercial landfill cells. This data was then translated into an established straight-line equivalent rate as set out in column 2 of schedule 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The straight-line equivalent rate in column 2 is further translated into an appropriate diminishing value depreciation rate as set out in column 1 of s chedule 11.

Although the estimated useful life of commercial landfill cells may vary in New Zealand, the amortisation rates for the listed landfill cell construction expenditure in this Determination are average rates for the waste management industry.

**Application of this Determination to expenditure incurred in an income year starting on or after 10 June 2005**

This Determination applies to taxpayers who meet the criteria under section DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and incur the listed landfill cell construction expenditure in an income year starting on or after 10 June 2005.

For example, taxpayers with the standard balance date of 31 March may apply this Determination from 1 April 2006 onwards. They shall not apply this Determination to their 2005-2006 income year or prior income years.

Where taxpayers have an approved non-standard balance date, the Determination applies to the listed landfill cell construction expenditure incurred in income years beginning on or after 10 June 2005. For example, for a taxpayer with a 30 June balance date, the Determination would apply from 1 July 2005.

Tax deductions for landfill cell construction expenditure incurred in those income returns furnished in respect of income years starting before 10 June 2005 should be based on the previous rules that applied. These previous rules will continue to apply to this expenditure, notwithstanding the issue of this Determination.

**Additions of new amortisation rates/amendments to existing amortisation rates**

Amendments to this Determination will be made by the Commissioner issuing supplementary Determinations pursuant to subsection 91AAN(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Amendments may include adding further expenditure to those already listed in column 1 of the schedule to this Determination or adjusting the estimated useful life of commercial landfill cells due to operational changes in the waste management industry in New Zealand. Such amendments will be effective for the current or future income years. They will not apply to previous income years.

Changes may also be made to the Determination from time to time by Inland Revenue on receipt of written applications from taxpayers in the waste management industry.

Applications for changes must include the following information:

*   applicant's details - this includes full name, IRD number (if applicable), address, telephone number, fax number and contact person for enquiries,
*   the nature of the amendment to the Determination being sought, and
*   information to support the change requested.

Applications for changes to the Determination are to be sent to:

The National Manager  
Technical Standards  
National Office  
Inland Revenue  
PO Box 2198  
WELLINGTON

In considering applications for amendments to this Determination, Inland Revenue will continue to consult with relevant taxpayers in the waste management industry and industry experts.

Inland Revenue will discuss any amendment to this Determination with the applicant before it is finalised.

Determination DET 05/03 Standard-Cost Household Service for Boarding Service Providers - change to fixed standard-cost formula to reflect the removal of depreciation on buildings
==================================================================================================================================================================================

Determination changes the fixed standard-cost formula in DET 05/03 to reflect the removal of depreciation on buildings. Applies 2012 onwards.

[Read the 2012 CPI adjustments figures](/determinations/standard-cost-household-service/boarding-service-providers/cpi-1202-cpi-adjustment-cpi-for-determination-det-0503-standard-cost-household-service-for-boarding-)

The current fixed standard-cost formula for calculating the notional costs of using a domestic dwelling for a home based boarding service activity allows 5% of the purchase price to represent the expenditure normally incurred in owning a domestic property.

There have been changes to depreciation on buildings since the issue of DET 05/03 that impact on the fixed standard-cost component for use of a domestic dwelling. _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 7 (August 2010), provided comment on the changes to building depreciation enacted in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010. The changes were intended to make New Zealand's tax rules more neutral by recognising that allowing depreciation on long-lived buildings provides tax depreciation rates in excess of true economic depreciation rates. The depreciation rate of buildings (including domestic dwellings) with long estimated useful lives of 50 years or more, has been changed to 0%, with effect to the 2012 income year (for most taxpayers this will apply from 1 April 2011).

DET 05/03 provides for depreciation as a notional cost as a component of the fixed standard-cost in applying a domestic dwelling to a home based boarding service activity. As a consequence of the May 2010 Budget change it is no longer appropriate to provide for depreciation on buildings in the standard-costs.

With the removal of depreciation on buildings in Budget 2010, some adjustment is required to the fixed standard-cost. The adjustment should have regard to increased property ownership costs that include maintenance of the land and related service costs. As the fixed cost amount is 5% of the purchase price of the property which includes the cost of land and improvements, the effect of removal of the depreciation element is a reduction to 4%.

The fixed cost percentage of the purchase price of the property used to calculate the ownership costs is reduced from 5% to 4% to reflect the change for depreciation on buildings.

This change has effect from 1 April 2011 and applies to the 2012 and subsequent income years.

Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers (Nov 05)
=======================================================================

DET 05/03 (Nov 2005) establishes allowable standard-costs for private boarding services provided from domestic accommodation.

This Determination, made pursuant to section 91AA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, may be cited as "Determination DET 05/03: Standard-Cost Household Service for Boarding Service Providers."

1.  **Explanation** (which does not form part of the Determination)
    1.  This Determination establishes allowable standard-costs for a household service that has been provided as private boarding services, by providers, who are natural persons, in their domestic accommodation. The standard-costs have been determined based on current tax law and are to be used for the calculation of a boarding service provider's income tax liability, if any. They cannot and should not be used for any other purpose.
    2.  It also describes the components of expenditure recognised as generally incurred in providing boarding services.
    3.  This Determination establishes a figure for a cost or costs for the purpose of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004 that may be treated as being incurred by a boarding service provider in deriving:
        1.  exempt income and
        2.  assessable income.
    4.  This Determination also prescribes a method of calculating such a figure, as set out in paragraph (c).
2.  **Reference**  
      
    This Determination is made pursuant to section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
3.  **Scope of Determination**  
      
    Except where its application is specifically excluded in another Determination or a fresh Determination, this Determination may be used by all natural persons who provide private boarding services in their domestic accommodation.  
      
    This Determination shall not apply to situations which are the subject of any other Determination made under section 91AA, such as where persons are accommodated in domestic accommodation as an extension of any specialised health care or institutional half-way house to facilitate rehabilitation. It also does not apply where the boarding service is provided as part of a GST taxable activity of a registered person or to cases where the boarding service provider has on average five or more boarders in residence during the income year.  
      
    Subject to any adjustment based on the annual movement of the Consumers Price Index as at the end of March each year, this Determination, unless specifically withdrawn, shall apply from the 2007 income year.
4.  **Interpretation**  
      
    In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   expressions used have the same meanings as those in sections CW 49 and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994
    *   "boarding service provider" means a natural person (which term shall include one or more natural persons living together in the same residence) who carries on an activity of providing a private boarding service in their domestic accommodation
    *   "private boarding service" means all activities in respect of accommodation and associated care including meals, laundry and utilities typically provided by a boarding service provider to other persons (boarders) in the boarding service provider's domestic accommodation, in return for payment
    *   "Consumers Price Index" means the application of the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index to the weekly standard-cost per boarder
    *   "domestic accommodation" means the dwelling which is the principal residence of any boarding service provider
    *   "standard-cost" in relation to any private boarding service, means the standard-cost that has been determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the purpose of this Determination, as referred to in section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
5.  **Standard-cost for boarding service providers: general notes**  
      
    A boarding service provider who derives income from such services in an income year, may:
    
    *   elect to use the standard-cost as set out in this Determination, and
    *   to that extent payments received from private boarding services will be exempt income.
    
      
      
    Boarding service providers may elect to use the standard-cost method by not including the amount of income derived from providing boarding services, up to but not exceeding the determined standard-costs in aggregate in any tax return otherwise required to be furnished.  
      
    A boarding service provider who makes such an election will not be eligible to claim any net tax loss. Losses may only be claimed where the taxpayer furnishes a full return of income (showing all payments received) and claims actual expenditure, with sufficient records available to support their tax position.  
      
    That is, where a boarding service provider elects to use the determined standard-costs, they may not deduct any additional cost of providing the boarding services, if the additional cost relates to an item of standard-cost expenditure represented in this Determination.
6.  **Determination**  
      
    A private boarding service shall be a standard-cost household service for the purposes of section 91AA where:
    
    *   the private boarding service involves the use of the boarding service provider's domestic accommodation, and
    *   the private boarding service involves activities and benefits that usually or commonly occur in or are derived from a domestic ("family") household.
    
      
      
    The standard-cost which the taxpayer may treat as incurred in deriving exempt income for the purposes of section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act 2004 consists of two elements - the weekly standard-cost per boarder and the annual capital standard-cost. It is expected however that many boarding service providers will be able to determine their tax position by referring to the weekly standard-cost, and will not need to additionally calculate the annual capital standard-cost.  
      
    _**(a) Weekly standard-cost per boarder**_  
      
    The weekly standard-cost per boarder represents the direct cost of providing private boarding services to each boarder on a weekly basis.  
     
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | _**Weekly standard-cost for one to two boarders**_ | **$200 each** |
    | _**Weekly standard-cost for third and subsequent boarders**_ | **$162 each** |
    
      
      
    This component covers expenditure on items and services typically provided to boarders, such as food, laundry, cleaning, heating, power, transport, telephone rental, use of bedroom chattels, general household furniture, linen and incidentals.  
      
    Where a taxpayer elects to use this method and the weekly payments for the relevant number of boarders in any week do not exceed the standard-cost amount, the income is exempt.  
      
    _**(b) Annual capital standard-cost**_  
      
    The annual capital standard-cost element represents the cost for the use of the domestic accommodation in providing the private boarding service and includes financing and depreciation costs. This is an annual calculation for the use of the domestic accommodation, based on:
    
    *   The actual cost to the boarding service provider of acquiring and making capital improvements to the domestic accommodation or renting the domestic accommodation in which the boarding services are provided
    *   the proportion of boarders who reside in the accommodation in relation to the overall average number of occupants, and
    *   the proportion of the actual period during which private boarding services are provided in an income year.
    
      
      
    The calculation depends on whether a boarding service provider owns or rents their domestic accommodation. Additionally, the annual capital cost calculated must be reduced by the amount of any accommodation supplement received by a boarding service provider.  
      
    (i) _**Boarding service provider who owns their domestic accommodation**_  
      
    Where a boarding service provider owns their domestic accommodation, the annual capital standard-cost for any income year must be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
     \[(a x 5%) - b\] x c x d  
      
    where-
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |     | a   | is the purchase price of the domestic accommodation plus the cost of all capital additions, and |
    |     | b   | is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the boarding service provider (weekly amount received multiplied by 52 weeks), and |
    |     | 5%  | represents the typical expenditure incurred in owning a domestic property, including depreciation of the building and outgoings such as rates, insurance, mortgage interest cost, repairs and maintenance, and |
    |     | c   | is the average percentage of boarders in relation to the overall average number of occupants living in the domestic accommodation during the income year, and |
    |     | d   | is the number of full weeks during which private boarding services were provided in an income year, divided by 52. |
    
      
      
    _**(ii) Boarding service provider who rents their domestic accommodation**_  
      
    Where the boarding service provider rents their domestic accommodation, the annual capital standard-cost for any income year must be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
     (a - b) x c x d  
      
    where-  
     
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    |     | a   | is the annualised rental payment (weekly rent paid x 52 weeks), and |
    |     | b   | is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the boarding service provider (weekly amount received x 52 weeks), and |
    |     | c   | is the average percentage of boarders in relation to the overall average number of occupants living in the domestic accommodation during the income year, and |
    |     | d   | is the number of full weeks during which private boarding services were provided in an income year, divided by 52. |
    
      
      
    The standard-cost for boarding service providers is calculated inclusive of GST, if any.  
      
    This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.  
     

This Determination is signed on the 14th day of November 2005.

Commentary on Determination DET 05/03
----------------------------------------

This commentary and its appendices do not form part of the Determination. They are intended to provide assistance in the understanding and application of the Determination.

This Determination and this commentary also appear in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17 No 10 (December 2005).

**Standard-cost basis and actual-cost basis**

1.  In accordance with section 91AA(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a boarding service provider may use the standard-cost basis to calculate their income tax liability for the elected income year.
2.  A boarding service provider elects to use the standard-cost basis by treating income from private boarding services as exempt income, either in a tax return or by electing not to file a tax return, up to but not exceeding the sum of standard-cost set in this Determination, for the relevant income year.
3.  The boarding service provider in any one income year, must adopt either the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis.
4.  In electing to use the actual-cost basis, a boarding service provider must keep sufficient records to support their tax position.

**Income tax implications and filing of tax returns**

The following income tax implications apply to a boarding service provider who provides a private boarding service and elects to use the standard-cost basis set out in the Determination.

1.  Section DA 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 prohibits any actual tax losses above the level of the standard-cost from being utilised against other income for any income year or carried forward to future income years.
2.  In accordance with section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act 2004, a boarding service provider would not be required to file a tax return for that income year if:
    1.  after applying the amount of standard-cost under the Determination, and treating boarding income up to that level as exempt, the boarding service provider has zero income tax liability, and
    2.  the boarding service provider does not have any other income where tax has not been deducted at source.

**Standard-cost election**

_Form of election_ -  
A boarding service provider may elect to use the standard-cost basis in calculating their income for an income year. An election is merely a decision to use either the standard-cost basis or actual-cost basis for calculating assessable income, if any, for an income year. An election does not require notice to be given to Inland Revenue of which method is used to calculate a boarding service provider's income for an income year.

_Timing of election_ -  
It is envisaged that many boarding service providers will make their election to use either the standard-cost or actual-cost basis at the beginning of an income year, as those who decide to use the actual-cost basis should prepare themselves to keep adequate records to support expenditure claimed at the end of the income year when filing a return. An election can be made at any time prior to filing a return. Should boarding service providers not provide a return of income by the due date for filing, it will be assumed they have elected to use the standard-cost option.

**Consumers Price Index**

To assist boarding service providers, Inland Revenue will publish the effect of the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index, as at the end of March each year, on the weekly standard-cost per boarder. The revised standard-cost component will be published in the _New Zealand Gazette_ and in Inland Revenue's _Tax Information Bulletin_ . This Determination uses information current as at March 2005.

The changes in the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index will not be applied to the annual capital standard-cost. This is because the basis for this component is either historical (where a boarding service provider owns their domestic accommodation) or market-related (where a boarding service provider rents their domestic accommodation).

An annual adjustment will be made as at March 2006 to the weekly standard-cost per boarder applicable for the 2007 income year.

**Goods and services tax (GST)**

As private boarding services are an exempt activity for GST purposes, boarding service providers will not be eligible to register for GST for this activity or claim back GST charged on goods and services consumed. Accordingly, the standard-cost components determined by the Commissioner have been prepared on a GST-inclusive basis.

**Purchase price of domestic accommodation**

The purchase price of a domestic accommodation will include any subsequent cost of capital improvement such as building an extension, but does not include the cost of general repairs and maintenance. Boarding service providers will be required to provide verification of capital improvements. The cost of improvements should be supported by receipts but may also be evidenced by local authority building consent applications detailing related costs, if applicable.

Current tax law allows deductions for expenditure to the extent such expenditure is incurred. Accordingly, boarding service providers are only permitted to use the purchase price and cost of capital improvements to a property; you cannot use current market or local body rateable values for the annual capital-cost calculation

**Family trusts**

Where a domestic property is in a family trust occupied by the beneficiaries who provide boarding services, they may only calculate the standard-cost for the annual capital component based on any rent paid. Any rent claimed will be proportional to the period of boarding services provided and further limited to the proportion of boarders compared to the average number of household occupants. The rent claim will be calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | **annual rent paid** |     | **service period** |     | **number of boarders** |
| **Rent claimable** | **\=** | \--------------- | **x** | \--------------- | **x** | \---------------- |
|     |     | **1** |     | **52 weeks** |     | **average household number** |

**International students and the code of practice**

Inland Revenue has used the code of practice for the Pastoral Care of International Students as the standard to ensure a sizable group of service providers are not denied the compliance cost reduction opportunities available under the standard-cost option.

Where five or more international students are accommodated as boarders, the domestic accommodation is a boarding establishment for the purposes and relevant standards of Code of Practice. The domestic accommodation may be viewed by Inland Revenue as a commercial dwelling. For example, a building required to be registered with local authorities under sec 636 of the Local Government Act 1974 as a residential institution will be considered a commercial dwelling by Inland Revenue.

**Receipt of accommodation supplement by a boarding service provider**

A boarding service provider may be entitled to an accommodation supplement. The Ministry of Social Development assesses each applicant's entitlement based on a set of guidelines. The assessment of entitlement takes into account such factors as accommodation costs, income, assets, family status, employment status and residential location. Where a boarding service provider is entitled to an accommodation supplement, the annual capital standard-cost will be reduced by the annual amount of the accommodation supplement received. The examples in Appendix C illustrate how the receipt of an accommodation supplement affects the calculation of the annual capital standard-cost for the use of domestic accommodation.

**Number of occupants and number of boarders**

Boarding service providers will need to record the period(s) during the year when they provide boarding services and the number of occupants in their household during those periods. This will allow them to correctly apply the rules relating to the annual capital standard-cost component. The calculation will involve a degree of rounding of the number of weeks for which boarding services were provided and (where family members come and go during the year) a fair estimate of the average number of occupants during that time.

Where a child (under 18 years) accompanies a parent or guardian in a private boarding service arrangement and there is no separate charge for keep of the child, they should not be counted as an occupant for the purpose of the annual capital standard-cost calculation.

Where a boarding service provider has a shared custody arrangement for a child over five years of age, the child should not be counted as an occupant for the purpose of the annual capital standard-cost calculation if they reside with the boarding service provider for less than half of the year. The same will apply where a dependent child is absent from the household while attending boarding school or living elsewhere for more than half of the year.

Children under five years of age should not to be counted as occupants (for the purpose of the annual capital standard-cost calculation) or as boarders (for the purpose of the weekly standard-cost calculations), where they are accompanying a parent or guardian boarding in a private boarding service arrangement. Similarly, any child under five years of age of the boarding service provider should not be counted.

Family visitors and guests accommodated without charge on a short-term stay are not counted as occupants for the purpose of the standard-cost calculation or as boarders for the weekly standard-cost calculations.

**Reimbursements**

Reimbursements for specific additional costs are not viewed as income nor are these costs viewed as an expense incurred by the boarding service provider, eg, payment received from the boarder for telephone toll calls.

**Impact on previously accepted practice**

Prior to the issue of Determination DET 05/03, boarding service providers may have applied the practice as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 5 No 9 (February 1994).

Determination DET 05/03 supersedes any previously accepted practice, which is now withdrawn. Boarding service providers, in calculating their income tax liability, must now elect to use either the standard-cost basis (as detailed in DET 05/03) or the actual-cost basis. In adopting the actual-cost basis, boarding service providers must also ensure sufficient records are kept to support their claimed tax position.

**Returning income**

The standard-cost components will assist the majority of boarding service providers to readily identify if they are required to return assessable income. The flowchart and table below outline the use of the standard-cost basis. They also show the key stages when boarding service providers should give consideration to an election on whether to use the standard-cost or actual-cost basis.

| **Do I have to return income?** |     |
| --- | --- |
| Step 1: | Is the average weekly charge for each boarder more than the standard-cost? $200 each for 1st or 2nd boarder, and $162 each for 3rd and subsequent boarder. |
| **If yes:** Part of the amounts received may be taxable income. Go to step 2. |
| **If no:** Income not taxable, not required to show in a return. Losses cannot be claimed. |
|     |     |
| Step 2: | Calculate the annual capital standard-cost amount - refer to Appendix C. |
|     |     |
| Step 3: | Are total payments received more than the sum of annualised weekly and capital standard-costs? |
| **If yes:** Excess amount is assessable income to be shown in return. **Note:** Your election to use either the standards-cost or actual-cost basis can be made at any time prior to filing a return |
| **If no:** Income not taxable, not required to show in a return. Losses cannot be claimed. |

When total payments received exceed the aggregate annualised value of weekly and capital standard-cost for the income year, boarding service providers are required to return the excess as assessable income.

Inland Revenue will accept, where there is more than one host providing boarding services, the returning of assessable income by the boarding service provider who is most directly involved on a day-to-day basis. This is to minimise compliance costs by only requiring one householder to file the return.

Where boarding service providers elect to claim expenditure on the actual-cost basis, they will be required to show all payments received as income and claim actual expenditure incurred in a return of income. In addition, they are required to keep sufficient records to support their tax position.

**Standard-costs as determined**

Determination DET 05/03 sets out the components of standard-costs that are likely to be incurred by boarding service providers. The standard-costs are determined based on special tax rules as provided for under current tax law. They are to be used for tax purposes only and cannot be used for any other purpose. The determined weekly standard-costs are not intended as any guide to the amounts which taxpayers can or should charge on a weekly basis, but rather reflect the maximum expenditure recognised by Inland Revenue as likely incurred by boarding service providers. Uniform weekly standard-cost rates are applied nationally to maintain simplicity and minimise tax compliance costs but it is accepted that there may be significant variations in the circumstances and amounts charged.

Should boarding service providers consider that the standard-cost components do not reflect the higher costs incurred in their situation, they may elect to use the actual-cost basis. They must keep sufficient records to support their tax position.

The variance in weekly standard-cost rates for smaller households with one to two boarders versus households with three or more boarders, acknowledge that larger households are more economical to operate when looking at costs incurred on average for each person. The weekly standard-cost rates are based on average costs, which are set on the higher end in favour of boarding service providers.

**Explanation of the weekly standard-cost expenditure items**

With the exception of bedroom and general household chattels, the weekly standard-cost items have been calculated based on statistical data from Statistics New Zealand. The level of costs arrived at takes into account the operation of economies of scale in relation to the size of a household.

_Food_ - This covers the cost of food and includes such items as fruit, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, farm products, fats, oils, cereals, sweet products, spreads, beverages, meals away from home, ready-to-eat meals and other foodstuffs.

_General household items_ - These cover household supplies for general cleaning and laundry products, toilet paper and other similar items.

_Heating and power_ - These cover the use of all appliances including the cost of heating, lighting, cooking and hot water. It includes other heating fuels such as gas, wood and coal.

_Transport costs_ - These cover the costs of providing transportation to boarders using public transport and road vehicles, and include vehicle ownership expenses.

_Telephone rental_ - This covers a 50% claim for a primary telephone rental, consistent with business use of a home phone, as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 5 No 12 (May 1994).

_Bedroom chattels and linen_ - These cover the straight line depreciation of a bed, student desk and chair, carpet, drapes, portable heater, electric blanket, bed linen, bathroom linen provided for a boarder's personal use. Further details are provided in Part II of this appendix.

_General household chattels_ - These cover the straight-line depreciation of a lounge suite, television, dining suite, dishwasher, washing machine, stove, microwave, crockery and cutlery items in general living areas used by boarders. This is further explained in Part II of this appendix.

_Incidentals_ - These cover miscellaneous expenditure such as gifts, leisure and entertainment activities provided by service providers to boarders.

**Part II STANDARD-COST FOR THE USE OF CHATTELS**

Provision for wear and tear of bedroom and general household chattels is included as part of the weekly standard-cost per boarder, as detailed in Part I of this appendix.

Chattels listed are those likely to be subject to greater wear and tear due to additional use by boarders. The values of the chattels reflect product ranges likely to be found in the average home, based on their current market purchase prices.

| Category/item | Standard value | Straight-line depreciation rate | Approx. annual cost | Standard-cost Calculation |     |
| Bed (single) | 500 | 12.5% | 62.50 | $634.75 divided by 52 weeks = $12.20 pw each boarder. |     |
| Dresser/drawer unit | 400 | 12.5% | 50.00 |
| Student desk and chair | 250 | 12.5% | 31.25 |

| Bed linen, blankets, covers | 500 | 40% | 200.00 |
|     |     |     | $634.75 |

The weekly standard-cost for the use of general household chattels has been apportioned to 50% ($12.50 weekly for each boarder, up to two boarders) for situations where only one or two boarders are hosted, whereas the apportionment for the third and subsequent number of boarders is reduced to 25% ($6.25 weekly for the third and subsequent number of boarders). The apportioned weekly amounts are relative to the average household of three persons (2001 census).

**APPENDIX B**

**EXAMPLES OF THE APPLICATION OF WEEKLY STANDARD-COST FOR BOARDING SERVICE PROVIDERS**

**_Example B1_**  
A boarding service provider owns a domestic property, which costs $200,000. The boarding service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances. One boarder pays $180 per week for accommodation over a full year. There are no other private boarders.

The boarding service provider elected to use the standard-cost basis in accordance with this Determination. As the weekly service payment received is less than the determined weekly standard-cost per boarder of $200, they are not required to return the income.

**_Example B2_**  
A boarding service provider rents a domestic property for $300 per week. The boarding service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week based on the location of the domestic accommodation and their individual circumstances. One boarder pays $180 per week for accommodation over a full year. There are no other private boarders.

The boarding service provider elected to use the standard-cost basis in accordance with this Determination. As the weekly service payment received is less than the determined weekly standard-cost per boarder of $200, they are not required to return the income.

**_Example B3_**  
Sharon lives at home and pays her parents $120 per week for board. There are no other private boarders. As the payment for board is less than the weekly standard-cost per boarder of $200, it will be exempt income and no tax liability arises for her mother for boarding service provided.

**APPENDIX C**

**EXAMPLES OF THE APPLICATION OF THE WEEKLY STANDARD-COST AND ANNUAL CAPITAL STANDARD-COST FOR BOARDING SERVICE PROVIDERS**

**(Note: All the calculations are rounded to the nearest dollar)**

**_Example C1_**  
A boarding service provider owns a domestic property. The purchase price of the domestic property is $200,000. The boarding service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances. One boarder is accommodated for $250 per week for a full year, in a household of four occupants (including the boarder). As the weekly rental exceeds the standard-cost, it is necessary to also calculate the annual capital cost component. The annual capital standard-cost per annum is:

\[($200,000 x 5%) - ($10 x 52)\] x 25% x 52/52 = $2,370

**_Example C2_**  
A boarding service provider rents a domestic property. The rent is $200 per week. The boarding service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week based on the location of the domestic accommodation and their individual circumstances. One boarder is accommodated for a full year for $250 per week, in a household of four occupants (including the boarder). The annual capital standard-cost per annum is:

\[($200 x 52) - ($20 x 52)\] x 25% x 52/52 = $2,340

**_Example C3_**  
A boarding service provider owns a domestic property that was purchased 20 years ago for $120,000. They do not receive an accommodation supplement. Two boarders are accommodated for the same period of six months (26 weeks) during the year, in a household of four occupants (including the two boarders). Both boarders each pay $250 weekly for the services provided.

The boarding service provider elected to use the standard-cost basis. As the weekly service payments received are greater than the weekly standard-cost figure of $200 for each boarder, it is necessary to calculate the annual capital standard-cost component to establish if assessable income should be returned.

The boarding service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Income ($250 x 26 x 2) | $13,000 |
| _Less:_ Weekly standard-cost<br><br>($200 x 26 x 2) | $10,400 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | $2,600 |
| _Less:_ Annual capital standard-cost<br><br>\[($120,000 x 5%) - $0\] x 50%; x 26/52 | $1,500 |
|     | \---------------- |
| Income to be returned | $1,100 |
|     |     |

**_Example C4_**  
A boarding service provider owns a domestic property, which cost $275,000. They do not receive an accommodation supplement. Three boarders live in the household at different periods of the year. One permanent boarder pays $200 per week over 12 months and two boarders each pay $250 per week for six months (26 weeks) in the second half of the year. The overall household of three occupants (including the permanent boarder) increases to five occupants in the latter half of the year.

The boarding service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Income ($250 x 26 x 2) = $13,000<br><br>($200 x 52 x 1) = 10,400 | $23,400.00 |
| _Less:_ Weekly standard-cost<br><br>($200 x 52) permanent boarder $10,400<br><br>($200 x 26) second boarder 5,200<br><br>($162 x 26) for third boarder 4,212 | $19,812.00 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | $3,588.00 |
| _Less:_ Annual capital standard-cost<br><br>\[($275,000 x 5%) - 0\] x 33% x 26/52 = $2,268.75<br><br>\[($275,000 x 5%) - 0\] x 60% x 26/52 = $4,125.00 | $6,393.75 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | ($2,805.75) |
|     | \---------------- |
| Income to be returned | Nil |
| Note that the apparent tax loss based on this calculation is not deductible against other income of the taxpayer or carried forward to future years. |     |

**_Example C5_**  
John provides boarding services to Joan and her four-year old son. John's partner and their two children each under five years old also occupy the household. As the three children are under five years, they are not counted as occupants for the purpose of the standard-cost calculation. John and his partner purchased their home for $150,000 ten years ago. No accommodation supplement is received.

In this situation, one boarder pays $240 per week for accommodation over a full year, in an overall household treated as consisting of three occupants (including the boarder). As the weekly service payment received is greater than the determined weekly standard-cost figure of $200, John will need to calculate the annual capital standard-cost component to establish if he or his partner is required to return income.

The boarding service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Income ($240 x 52) | $12,480 |
| _Less:_ Weekly standard-cost<br><br>($200 x 52) | $10,400 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | $2,080 |
| _Less:_ Annual capital standard-cost<br><br>\[($150,000 x 5%) - 0\] x 33% x 52/52 | $2,475 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | ($395) |
|     | \---------------- |
| Income to be returned | Nil |
| Note that the apparent tax loss based on this calculation is not deductible against other income of the taxpayer or carried forward to future years. |     |

**_Example C6_**  
Rosanne purchased a home for $400,000 and had two groups of four students boarding with her between January to June (23 weeks), and July to December (23 weeks). Each boarder was charged $280 weekly during their stay.

The boarding service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Income ($280 x 23 x 4 x 2) | $51,520 |
| _Less:_ Weekly standard-cost<br><br>($200 x 23 x 2 x 2) = $18,400<br><br>($162 x 23 x 2 x 2) = $14,904 | $33,304 |
|     | \---------------- |
|     | $18,216 |
| _Less:_ Annual capital standard-cost<br><br>\[($400,000 x 5%) - 0\] x 80% x 46/52 | $14,154 |
|     | \---------------- |
| Income to be returned | $4,062 |
| **Note:** If Rosanne's tax to pay is $2,500 or more, she will also have to pay provisional tax for the following year. |     |

**Example C7**  
A not-for-profit organisation purchases a motel and employs a manager to provide care for forty students, occupying the motel units as boarders. The manager lives on site and arranges for meals to be delivered to the students in his care. The use of the motel to provide boarding services for the students has been approved by the local council as a residential institution. The manager enquires whether the Determination can be applied to the above situation.

The Determination is not available to the boarding service provider, for the reasons below:

*   The not-for-profit organisation is not a natural person
*   The residential establishment does not fit within the scope of a domestic dwelling.

The activity run by the not-for-profit organisation will likely be viewed by Inland Revenue as a commercial boarding house. All payments should be returned as income and allowable expenditure claimed, with sufficient records to support the tax position. If total payments received for the boarding services exceed $40,000 for any twelve month period, the service provider will also be required to register for GST purposes.

Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers - preliminary consumers price index adjustments 06/02 (April 2006)
=================================================================================================================================

Preliminary CPI Adjustment 06/02 (2006) for Determination DET 05/03: Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers.

In accordance with the provisions of Determination _DET-05/03_, as published in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005), Inland Revenue advises that, for the 2007 income year, the preliminary _weekly standard-cost_ component is to be adjusted as follows:

*   The _weekly standard-cos_t for one to two boarders will increase from $200 each to $207 each.
*   The _weekly standard-cost_ for third and subsequent number of boarders will increase from $162 each to $168 each.

The above amounts have been adjusted in accordance with the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index for the twelve months to March 2006, which showed an increase of 3.3 percent. For boarding service providers who have a standard 31 March balance date, the new amounts apply for the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 . These adjusted amounts are intended as a preliminary indication of the likely levels of weekly standard-costs. These figures will be further adjusted, to apply retrospectively to the 2007 income year, based on the All Groups Consumers Price Index movement for the twelve months ending March 2007, when available.

Standard-cost household service for home share care providers
=============================================================

Determination DET 09/01 (2009) sets out the standard-cost household service for home share care providers.

This determination may be cited as "Determination DET 09/01: _Standard-cost household service for home share care providers_".

This determination also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009).

### Introduction

This determination is made pursuant to section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

1.  This determination sets out the standard-cost household service that has been provided as homeshare care services by taxpayers, who are natural persons, in the service providers (‘taxpayers') own domestic accommodation.
    
2.  It also sets out the components of expenditure that are generally incurred in the provision of the standard-cost household service by these taxpayers.
    
3.  This determination determines a figure for a cost or costs that for the purpose of the Tax Administration Act 1994 may be treated as being incurred by a taxpayer in deriving:  
      
    
    1.  exempt income; and
    2.  gross income.
    
4.  This determination also prescribes a method of calculating such a figure, as set out in paragraph c.
    

### Application

This determination only applies to services provided by homeshare providers via the Presbyterian Support (Upper South Island) Homeshare programme operating in the Mid Canterbury area.

The determination applies only to natural persons, being homeshare care providers, who provide the service in their own domestic accommodation.

The standard costs contained in this determination are inclusive of goods and services tax ("GST"). Persons who are registered for GST may be required to make an adjustment to their GST return to the extent that they have claimed GST back on goods and services which are subsequently used in providing homeshare services, ie as these costs would not have been incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity.

This determination, unless specifically withdrawn, shall apply from the 2009 and subsequent income years.

### Definitions

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

Expressions used have the same meanings as those in sections CW 61 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

"Homeshare care" means the provision of a day activity programme for older people, aimed particularly at those in rural areas who have difficulty accessing centralised services, using local people as hosts. Service providers are contracted to provide a daytime base in their own accommodation, hosting activities, companionship and meals. Note: This service is not to be confused with a homeshare partnership between a householder, usually an older person with a spare room, and a homesharer, a younger person who in return for accommodation provides help around the home or companionship and/or security.

"Standard-cost household service for homeshare care providers", in relation to any homeshare care service, means the standard-cost that has been determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the purpose of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Determination

#### Provision of homeshare care service

A homeshare care service shall be a standard-cost household service where:

1.  the service provider is a natural person; and
2.  the homeshare care service requires the use of the service provider's domestic accommodation; and
3.  the homeshare care service involves activities that commonly occur in a family household; and
4.  the homeshare care service provided is in accordance with the Home and Community Support Sector Standard (NZS 8158:2003); and
5.  The service is provided on as part of the Presbyterian Support (Upper South Island) Homeshare programme.

#### Standard-cost for homeshare care providers

A service provider who in an income year derives gross income from providing a homeshare care service may elect to deduct the expenditure as set out in this determination.

Where a service provider makes such an election, they shall not deduct any additional cost of providing the homeshare care service, if the additional cost relates to a type of expenditure that is covered in this determination.

1.  _Variable standard-cost_  
    Variable standard-cost shall be:  
      
    
    1.  $16.20 each day, for the first guest, and
    2.  $12.85 each day, for the second and subsequent number of guests.
    
      
    This shall cover expenditure on items such as electricity/fuel, food, wear and tear, outings and associated transport costs, laundry, educational resources, equipment and first aid.
    
2.  _Fixed standard-cost_  
    Fixed standard-cost shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall not vary in relation to the number of guests under care. Fixed standard-cost shall comprise two categories, namely administration and record keeping, and domestic accommodation.  
      
    Administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost shall be $260.00 per annum and shall include such items as the use of telephone, postage and stationery, the use of computers and other incidental administration costs.  
      
    The domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost is to be calculated using the formula relevant to the service provider circumstances, ie whether they own or rent their domestic accommodation.  
      
    Additionally, where the service provider is entitled to an accommodation supplement, the annual deduction calculated shall be reduced by the amount of the accommodation supplement received.  
      
    
    1.  _Homeshare care provider who owns their domestic property_  
          
        Where the service provider owns their domestic property, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
          
        
        \[(a x 5%) \- b\] x 50% x 8%
        
          
        Where:  
          
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | a   | is the purchase price of the domestic property; and |
        | b   | is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the service provider (ie weekly amount received x 52 weeks); and |
        | 5%  | represents the expenditure normally incurred in owning a domestic property, including depreciation of the building and outgoings such as rates, insurance, mortgage interest cost; and |
        | 50% | represents the usage factor that is based on usage by area such as bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, toilet/bathroom, other living areas and the use of outdoor areas; and |
        | 8%  | represents the availability factor that is based on a five and a half hour day for an average of two and a third days each week, averaging 12 and two third hours per week. |
        
    
    2.  _Homeshare care provider who rents their domestic property_  
          
        Where the service provider rents their domestic property, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
          
        
        (a \- b) x 50% x 8%
        
          
        Where:  
          
        
        |     |     |
        | --- | --- |
        | a   | is the annualised rental payment (ie weekly rent paid x 52 weeks); and |
        | b   | is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the service provider (ie weekly amount received x 52 weeks); and |
        | 50% | represents the usage factor that is based on usage by area such as bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, toilet/bathroom, other living areas and the use of outdoor areas; and |
        | 8%  | represents the availability factor that is based on a five and a half hour day for an average of two and a third days each week, averaging 12 and two third hours per week. |
        
    
3.  _Exempt income_  
      
    The sum of the variable standard cost and the fixed standard cost calculated in accordance with this determination, relevant to the homeshare care provider's circumstances, shall be treated as exempt income or expenditure incurred in providing the services.
    

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 15th day of April 2009.

### Commentary on determination DET 09/01

This commentary and its appendices do not form part of the determination. They are intended to provide assistance in the understanding and application of the determination.

#### Standard-cost basis and actual-cost basis

1.  In accordance with section 91AA(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a homeshare care service provider who uses the standard-cost basis set by the Commissioner in determining their income tax liability has elected this basis to be appropriate for their circumstances.
2.  A service provider who elects to use the standard-cost basis determined by the Commissioner must use this basis to calculate their income tax liability for the elected income year.
3.  The service provider must adopt either the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis, but not both, for an income year with the exception of one-off costs actually incurred (refer to the commentary on additional costs).
4.  As the use of the standard-cost basis is optional, service providers will not be precluded from adopting the actual-cost basis or from opting in and out of the standard-cost basis for any subsequent income year.
5.  A service provider who does not elect to use the standard-cost basis set by the Commissioner in determining their income tax liability must use the actual-cost basis. In electing to use the actual-cost basis, the service provider must ensure that they have adhered to all the record keeping requirements for verifying the costs.

#### Income tax implications and filing of tax returns

The following income tax implications apply to a service provider who elects to use the standard-cost basis set out in the determination.

1.  Standard-cost expenditure that exceeds payments received is not available as expenditure against other income for any income year, nor can it be carried forward to future income years.
2.  In accordance with section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a service provider would not be required to file a tax return for that income year if:  
      
    1.  after deducting the amount of standard-cost under the determination, the service provider has zero income tax liability; and
    2.  the service provider did not have any other income where tax has not been deducted at source.

#### Goods and services tax (GST)

As the annual turnover from homeshare care services is expected to be well below the registration threshold for GST and it is presumed that service providers will not be registered for GST for the homeshare care service activity. Therefore, the standard-cost components determined by the Commissioner have been prepared on a GST inclusive basis.

#### Purchase price of domestic property

The purchase price of a domestic property will include any subsequent cost of improvement to the domestic property. Service providers will be required to provide verification of such additional costs incurred, if applicable.

#### Receipt of accommodation supplement by a service provider

A service provider may be entitled to an accommodation supplement. The Ministry of Social Development assesses each applicant's entitlement based on a set of guidelines. The assessment of entitlement takes into account such factors as accommodation costs, income and assets, family status, employment status and residential location. Where a service provider is entitled to an accommodation supplement, the amount of annual domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost calculated will be reduced by the annual amount of the accommodation supplement received. The examples in Appendix B illustrate how the receipt of an accommodation supplement affects the calculation of the annual domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost.

#### Additional costs

Where a service provider has incurred additional one-off costs, which have not been taken into account by the Commissioner in arriving at the standard-cost in the determination, such costs will be allowed as an additional deduction. The service provider must however demonstrate to Inland Revenue that such costs have been incurred for the Homeshare care service they provide. An example may be expenses incurred to comply with the training requirements of the Home and Community Support Sector Standard (NZS 8158:2003).

#### Reimbursements

Where a funding organisation or guest reimburses a service provider for specific costs incurred, these costs are not allowed as deductions against their gross income. For example, the money received from guests for the admission fee to the cinema is not regarded as gross income. The admission fee to the cinema will not be allowed as a deduction to the service provider.

### Appendix A: Weekly variable standard-cost items

The standard-cost per guest has been based on the cost for an operation providing services to three guests on a weekly basis (average two and a third / three days) as below:

| Item of expenditure | Cost ($) |
| --- | --- |
| Electricity/fuel | 10.00 |
| Food | 21.00 |
| Wear and tear | 7.50 |
| Laundry | 5.00 |
| Equipment | 4.00 |
| First aid | 1.00 |
| **Total** (based on 5.5 hours average for 3 days) | **48.50** |
| **Average daily cost for first guest** | **16.20** |
| **Average daily cost for second and subsequent number of guests**  <br>(less adjustment for common cost of electricity/fuel) | **12.85** |

#### Explanation of weekly variable standard-cost items

_Electricity/fuel ($10.00)_  
This covers the use of all appliances including the cost of heating, lighting and hot water. It includes other heating fuels such as gas, wood and coal.

_Food ($21.00)_  
This covers the cost of food that is supplied and includes basics such as bread, milk, fruit juice and biscuits. The cost of baking involved/provided for guests is also included in this figure. It also covers incidentals such as tea and coffee consumed by service providers and guests.

_Wear and tear ($7.50)_  
These cover all related expenses and include such expenses as the cleaning of carpets, repairing/replacing furnishings (e.g. rugs, linen), repairs and maintenance of equipment and appliances.

_Laundry ($5.00)_  
This not only covers obvious cleaning and laundry products but also rubber gloves, toilet paper and other similar items.

_Equipment ($4.00)_  
This covers the cost of providing indoor and outdoor equipment such as video tapes/DVDs, puzzles and games.

_First aid ($1.00)_  
This covers the requirement to have a first aid cabinet equipped to the standard set by the Ministry of Health/District Health Boards.

### Appendix B: Application of the standard-cost basis as determined by the Commisioner for homeshare care providers

**Note:** All the calculations are rounded to the nearest dollar.

_Example 1_

A service provider owns a domestic property. The purchase price of the domestic property is $200,000. The service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances. Therefore, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost that the service provider may elect as a deduction per annum is:

\[($200,000 x 5%) \- ($10 x 52)\] x 50% x 8% = $379.00

_Example 2_

A service provider rents a domestic property. The rent is $200 per week. The service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week based on the location of the domestic accommodation and their individual circumstances. Therefore, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost that the service provider may elect as a deduction per annum is:

\[($200 x 52) \- ($20 x 52)\] x 50% x 8% = $374.00

_Example 3_

A service provider owns a domestic property, which costs $200,000. The service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances.

The service provider provided care for an average of three guests in the income year for a total of 96 days. The service provider elected to use the standard-cost basis in accordance with determination DET 09/01: _Standard-cost household service for homeshare care providers_.

The service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

| Income |     |     | **$12,960.00** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Less:** | Variable standard-cost  <br>First guest @ $16.20 x 96 days  <br>Second & subsequent guest @ 2 x $12.85 x 96 days | $1,555.20  <br>$2,467.20 | $4,022.00 |
| $8,938.00 |     |     |
| **Less:** | Fixed standard-cost  <br>Domestic accommodation as per Example 1  <br>Administration and record keeping | $379.00  <br>$260.00 | $639.00 |
| **Taxable income** |     |     | **$8,299.00** |

_Example 4_

A service provider rents a domestic property for $200 per week. The service provider receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week based on the location of the domestic accommodation and their individual circumstances.

The service provider provided care for an average of three guests in the income year for a total of 96 days. The service provider elected to use the standard-cost basis in accordance with determination DET 09/01: _Standard-cost household service for homeshare care providers_.

The service provider's income tax liability is calculated as follows:

| Income |     |     | **$12,960.00** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Less:** | Variable standard-cost |     | $4,022.00 |
| $8,938.00 |     |     |
| **Less:** | Fixed standard-cost  <br>Domestic accommodation as per Example 2  <br>Administration and record keeping | $374.00  <br>$260.00 | $634.00 |
| **Taxable income** |     |     | **$8,304.00** |

Changes/clarifications to Determination DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers ("Educators")
========================================================================================================================

Notice changes/clarifies 'DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers' including depreciation on certain buildings.

[Read the 2012 CPI adjustments figures](/determinations/standard-cost-household-service/childcare-providers/cpi-1201-cpi-adjustment-cpi-for-determination-det-0902-standard-cost-household-service-for-childcare)

### Background

Legislation enacted in November 2003 (with effect from 1 April 2003) allows the Commissioner to issue a determination of standard-costs for specified home based services to provide a consistent and legal framework for the taxation of home based service providers, including the home based childcare industry.

Standard-cost Determinations are intended to be used by service providers who are generally paid a low hourly rate and consequently their tax obligations may be disproportionate to the amount of tax involved. The availability of a standard-cost determination enables those taxpayers to meet their tax obligations with minimal compliance costs. For example, if a person who provides childcare services in their own home elects to use the standard costs in Determination 09/02 ("DET 09/02") and payments received are below the annual calculation, they will not have to pay income tax and will not be required to file an income tax return for that year, provided they do not have other income.

In accordance with the new provisions, in May 2004 Inland Revenue issued Determination DET-001 (May 2004) which set out the components of expenditure (standard costs) that are typically incurred by educators who provide childcare services in their own domestic accommodation. Those standards costs were based on the requirements for care by educators who operate in accordance with the Education (home-based Care) Order ("the Order") and/or the Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008 ("the Regulations") and Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008[1](#1)
. Determination DET-001 was replaced by DET 09/02 issued April 2009, with application to the 2009 and subsequent income years.

A person who provides private childcare in their own home and are not part of a licensed service provider network, is not able to use DET 09/02. These providers must keep full records of actual income and may claim a deduction for actual expenditure.

### Changes/Clarifications

Following feedback on DET 09/02, this notice provides advice on changes and clarifications to accepted practice and the change to depreciation on buildings (to 0%) that impact on the fixed standard-costs for ownerships costs of domestic dwellings.

#### a)   That the application of DET 09/02 include before and after school care and recreation for school aged children (Change)

*   The scope of DET 09/02 is consistent with the Order, which specifies the standard of care for children up to five years of age (or six if starting school then). At the time of the original determination (DET-001) there were no additional licensing requirements for school-aged children cared for by chartered home-based providers. Provided the home-based care organisation was eligible to received Work & Income ("WINZ") childcare subsidies, it was accepted that if they were approved for preschool care, they were automatically approved for school-aged care.

*   From the 1980's through to early 2000's, many home-based care organisations offered before and after school care to families. Child, Youth and Family produced the Standards for Out of School Care and Recreation ("OSCAR"). At the time of issuing the original determination, OSCAR services for children aged 5 - 13 years was a common feature of home based childcare activity but never considered as part of the scope of the determination.

*   As the OSCAR activities are similar in nature to the home-based childcare services for preschool-aged children, some educators have extended their childcare activity to include OSCAR care for school-aged children. For these reasons the application of DET 09/02 is extended to cover payments received by educators for OSCAR activities. The extension of DET 09/02 to include OSCAR services will only apply to educators who have expanded their activity to provide care to school-aged children before or after school, and/or for school holiday programmes. The change will assist to simplify the tax obligations of educators providing care for school-aged children as an extension of their home based childcare activity. DET 09/02 does not apply to educators who only provide OSCAR care to school-aged children as they were not the focus of the original standard-cost determination.

**b)   Retainer payments to educators (Clarification)**

1.  Payments made to educators to preserve a child's placement in a childcare programme for absent children, or paid when an educator (or a family member) is sick, are to be treated as income (being payments for lost income) related to their home-based childcare activity. In these circumstances, an educator may also claim the related variable standard-costs as if the child(ren) had attended;
2.  Retainer payments to an educator while they are on vacation are also income related to an educator's home-based childcare activity. As they are on a planned absence from the home-based childcare activity while on vacation, they are not permitted to claim the variable standard-costs in these circumstances but are able to offset the full annualised fixed standard-cost amount for the use of their domestic property.

**c)   Claiming of additional costs (Clarification)**

*   Where an educator has incurred additional costs, which have not been identified as being regularly incurred and therefore not specifically listed in the standard-cost set out in DET 09/02, such additional costs will be allowed (being income related expenditure) as an additional standard-cost of providing their home-based childcare service. Examples are expenses incurred to meet the training requirements of the Order/Regulations for First Aid courses, qualification and ongoing professional development and ACC levies (when applicable).

*   However, an educator is not permitted to claim additional expenditure for costs already provided for under DET 09/02 in the variable and fixed standard-cost categories. For example, digital cameras, printers, cell-phones and car-seat harnesses as an alternative to car seats for small children, are already covered by the variable standard-cost components for "equipment" and "outings and associated transport costs".

*   The appendix to DET 09/02 provides an explanation of the variable standard-costs that refers to what each item within the cost elements are intended to cover. The examples are indicative only and every element refers to examples as being inclusive of those items.

**d)   Apportionment of annualised fixed standard-cost for use of domestic dwelling and administration costs (Change & Clarification)**

*   A worksheet is available to assist educators to work out whether they are required to return income for an income year. The first part of these worksheets is used to tally gross payments received each month and the childcare hours provided each month. The second part has a calculation for claiming variable standard-costs for the total hours of childcare provided. These worksheets also include an apportionment of the fixed standard-cost to the number of weeks childcare provided during an income year by educators. Some organisations (whether they use this worksheet or not) may advocate an apportionment of 52 weeks whereas others use a 48 week apportionment (presumably after allowing for vacation of 4 weeks each year).

*   The fixed standard-cost is calculated on an annual basis and does not vary for the number of children in care. It is acknowledged that educators incur some static costs (storage of educational resources and ongoing administration costs) for use of their domestic dwelling regardless of whether they are providing childcare services or on vacation or sick leave.  
      
    **Change/clarification:**
    *   An apportionment should be calculated on a 52 week basis consistent with the number of weeks in an income year; not 48 weeks.
    *   That educators operating a home based childcare activity for a full year (ignoring vacation breaks and absences due to sickness) may claim the full annualised fix standard-cost amount.
    *   That educators who commence or exit a home based childcare activity part-way through an income year (1 April to 31 March) are required to apportion the fixed standard-cost amount relative to the number of weeks (or part weeks) their activity has been operated in an income year (52 week period).

**e)   Adjustment to fixed standard-cost to reflect removal of depreciation on buildings (Change)**

*   The current fixed standard-cost formula for calculating the notional costs of using a domestic dwelling for a home based childcare activity allows 5% of the purchase price to represent the expenditure normally incurred in owning a domestic property.

*   There have been changes to depreciation on buildings since the issue of DET 09/02 that impact on the fixed standard-cost component for use of a domestic dwelling. Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 22 No 7 (August 2010), provided comment on the changes to building depreciation enacted in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010. The changes were intended to make New Zealand's tax rules more neutral by recognising that allowing depreciation on long-lived buildings provides tax depreciation rates in excess of true economic depreciation rates. The depreciation rate of buildings (including domestic dwellings) with long estimated useful lives of 50 years or more, has been changed to 0%, with effect to the 2012 income year (for most taxpayers this will apply from 1 April 2011).

*   DET 09/02 provides for depreciation as a notional cost as a component of the fixed standard-cost in applying a domestic dwelling to a home based childcare activity. As a consequence of the May 2010 Budget change it is no longer appropriate to provide for depreciation on buildings in the standard-costs

*   With the removal of depreciation on buildings in the Budget 2010, some adjustment is required to the fixed standard-cost. The adjustment should have regard to increased property ownership costs that include maintenance of the land and related service costs. As the fixed cost amount is 5% of the purchase price of the property which includes the cost of land and improvements, the effect of removal of the depreciation element is a reduction to 4%.

*   The fixed costs percentage of the purchase price of the property used to calculate the ownership costs is reduced from 5% to 4% to reflect the change for depreciation on buildings.

The changes/clarifications have effect from 1 April 2011 and apply to the 2012 and subsequent income years.

* * *

1: As services are gradually being re-licensed under the 2008 Regulations and Licensing Criteria, the Order will become obsolete by 2014.

1.  This Determination sets out the standard-cost household service that has been provided as childcare services by taxpayers, who are natural persons, in their own domestic accommodation.
2.  It also sets out the components of expenditure that are generally incurred in the provision of the standard-cost household service by these taxpayers.
3.  This Determination determines a figure for a cost or costs that for the purpose of the Tax Administration Act 1994 may be treated as being incurred by a taxpayer in deriving:
    1.  exempt income; and
    2.  gross income.
4.  This Determination also prescribes a method of calculating such a figure, as set out in paragraph c.

2.  **Reference**

This Determination is made pursuant to section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

3.  **Scope of Determination**

Except where its application is specifically excluded in another Determination or a fresh Determination pursuant to section 91AA(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this Determination shall apply to all natural persons who are not registered for goods and services tax purposes and who have provided childcare services in their own domestic accommodation. In addition, this Determination will only apply to persons who provide childcare in accordance with the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008.  
This Determination replaces the Commissioner’s practice published in the former Determination DET 001 which is withdrawn with effect from 1 April 2008. This Determination shall apply to the 2009 and subsequent income years until it is replaced but will be subject to an adjustment based on the annual movement of the Consumer Price Index, as at 31 March each year.  

4.  **Interpretation**

In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meanings as those in sections CW 61 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994: “Childcare provider” means a natural person who carries on an activity of providing a standard-cost household service in their own domestic accommodation:  
  
“Childcare service” means a service that is provided by a childcare provider:  
  
“Consumers Price Index” means the application of the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index to the variable standard-cost component and the administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost component, but not the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost component, of the standard-cost household service for childcare providers:  
  
“Standard-cost household service for childcare providers”, in relation to any childcare service, means the standard-cost that has been determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the purpose of the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994:  
  
“Order” means the Education (Home-Based Care) Order 1992 and/or the Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008.  

5.  **Determination**

**Provision of childcare service**  
A childcare service shall be a standard-cost household service where:  

1.  the childcare provider is a natural person; and  
    
2.  the childcare service requires the use of the childcare provider’s domestic accommodation; and  
    
3.  the childcare service involves activities that commonly occur in a family household; and  
    
4.  the childcare service provided is a kind specified in the Order.  
    

**Standard-cost for childcare providers**  
Where applicable, the standard-cost for childcare providers shall be inclusive of goods and services tax (“GST”). Persons who are registered for GST may be required to make an adjustment to their GST return to the extent that they have claimed GST back on goods and services which are subsequently used in providing homeshare services i.e., as these costs would not have been incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity.  
  
A childcare provider who in an income year derives gross income from providing a childcare service may elect to deduct the expenditure as set out in this Determination.  
  
Where a childcare provider makes such an election, they shall not deduct any additional cost of providing the childcare service, if the additional cost relates to a type of expenditure that is covered in this Determination.  

1.  **Variable standard-cost**  
      
    Variable standard-cost shall be $3.09 per hour per child. This shall cover expenditure on items such as electricity/fuel, food, wear and tear, outings and associated transport costs, laundry, educational resources, modification costs, equipment and first aid.
2.  **Fixed standard-cost**  
      
    Fixed standard-cost shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall not vary in relation to the number of children under care. Fixed standard-cost shall comprise two categories, namely administration and record keeping, and domestic accommodation.  
    Administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost shall be $301.00 per annum and shall include such items as the use of telephone, postage and stationery, the use of computers and other incidental administration costs.  
      
    The Determination of domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost shall depend on whether the childcare provider owns or rents their domestic accommodation. Additionally, where the childcare provider is entitled to an accommodation supplement, the annual deduction calculated shall be reduced by the amount of the accommodation supplement received.
    1.  **Childcare provider who owns their domestic property**  
        Where the childcare provider owns their domestic property, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
        
        \[(a x 5%) \- b\] x 50% x 33.33%
        
          
        where-  
          
        a     is the purchase price of the domestic property; and  
          
        b     is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the childcare provider (i.e. weekly amount received x 52 weeks); and  
          
        5%     represents the expenditure normally incurred in owning a domestic property, including depreciation of the building and outgoings such as rates, insurance, mortgage interest cost; and  
          
        50%     represents the usage factor that is based on usage by area such as bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, toilet/bathroom, other living areas and the use of outdoor areas pursuant to the Order; and  
          
        33.33%     represents the availability factor that is based on a 7.30am / 5.30pm drop off/pick up for Mondays to Fridays and a 7.30am / 12.30pm. for Saturdays/Sundays, totalling 55 hours per week.  
        
    2.  **Childcare provider who rents their domestic property**  
        Where the childcare provider rents their domestic property, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:  
        
        (a \- b) x 50% x 33.33%
        
          
        where-  
          
        a     is the annualised rental payment (i.e. weekly rent paid x 52 weeks); and is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the childcare provider (i.e. weekly amount received x 52 weeks); and  
          
        b     is the annualised amount of accommodation supplement received by the childcare provider (i.e. weekly amount received x 52 weeks); and  
          
        50%     represents the usage factor that is based on usage by area such as bedrooms, kitchen, laundry, toilet/bathroom, other living areas and the use of outdoor areas pursuant to the Order; and  
          
        33.33%     represents the availability factor that is based on a 7.30am / 5.30pm drop off/pick up for Mondays to Fridays and a 7.30am / 12.30pm. for Saturdays/Sundays, totalling 55 hours per week.  
        

**Exempt income**  
  
The sum of the variable standard cost and the fixed standard cost calculated in accordance with this Determination, relevant to the childcare provider’s circumstances, shall be treated as exempt income or expenditure incurred in providing the services.  
  
This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  
  
This Determination is signed on the 21st day of April 2009.

Commentary on Determination DET 09/02
-------------------------------------

This commentary and its appendices do not form part of the Determination. They are intended to provide assistance in the understanding and application of the Determination.

**Standard-cost basis and actual-cost basis**

1.  In accordance with section 91AA(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a childcare provider who uses the standard-cost basis set by the Commissioner in determining their income tax liability has elected this basis to be appropriate for their circumstances.
2.  A childcare provider who elects to use the standard-cost basis determined by the Commissioner must use this basis to calculate their income tax liability for the elected income year.
3.  The childcare provider must adopt either the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis, but not both, for an income year with the exception of one-off costs actually incurred (refer to the commentary on additional costs).
4.  As the use of the standard-cost basis is optional, childcare providers will not be precluded from adopting the actual-cost basis or from opting in and out of the standard-cost basis for any subsequent income year.
5.  A childcare provider who does not elect to use the standard-cost basis set by the Commissioner in determining their income tax liability must use the actual-cost basis. In electing to use the actual-cost basis, the childcare provider must ensure that they have adhered to all the record keeping requirements for verifying the costs.

**Income tax implications and filing of tax returns**

1.  The following income tax implications apply to a childcare provider who provides childcare service and elects to use the standard-cost basis set out in the Determination.
2.  Section CW 61 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will treat any income received by a childcare provider as being exempt income, to the extent to which the standard cost applies to the childcare provider’s gross income.
3.  Standard-cost expenditure that exceeds payments received is not available as expenditure against other income for any income year, nor can it be carried forward to future income years.
4.  In accordance with section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, a service provider would not be required to file a tax return for that income if:
5.  after deducting the amount of standard-cost under the Determination, the service provider has zero income tax liability; and
6.  The service provider did not have any other income where tax has not been deducted at source.

**Consumers Price Index**

To assist childcare providers, Inland Revenue will publish the effect of the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index as at 3 March on the variable standard-cost component and the administration and record keeping fixed standard-cost component. The revised standard-cost components will be published in Inland Revenue’s _Tax Information Bulletin_ in May of each year.

The changes in the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index will not be applied to the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost component. This is because the basis for this component is either historical (where a childcare provider owns their domestic accommodation) or market related (where a childcare provider rents their domestic accommodation).

The first such annual adjustment will be for the income year 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010.

**Goods and services tax (GST)**

As the annual turnover from childcare services is expected to be well below the registration threshold for GST, it is presumed that few childcare providers will be registered for GST. Therefore, the standard-cost components determined by the Commissioner have been prepared on a GST inclusive basis.

**Purchase price of domestic property**

The purchase price of a domestic property will include any subsequent cost of improvement to the domestic property. Childcare providers will be required to provide verification of such additional costs incurred.

**Receipt of accommodation supplement by a childcare provider**

A childcare provider may be entitled to an accommodation supplement.; The Ministry of Social Development assesses each applicant’s entitlement based on a set of guidelines. The assessment of entitlement takes into account such factors as accommodation costs, income and assets, family status, employment status and residential location. Where a childcare provider is entitled to an accommodation supplement, the amount of annual domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost calculated will be reduced by the annual amount of the accommodation supplement received. The examples in Appendix B illustrate how the receipt of an accommodation supplement affects the calculation of the annual domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost.

**Additional costs**

Where a childcare provider has incurred additional one-off costs, which have not been taken into account by the Commissioner in arriving at the standard-cost in the Determination, such costs will be allowed as an additional deduction. The childcare provider must however demonstrate to Inland Revenue that such costs have been incurred for the childcare service they provide. An example may be expenses incurred to comply with the training requirements of the Order. 

**Reimbursements**

Where a parent or guardian reimburses a childcare provider for specific costs incurred, these costs are not allowed as deductions against their gross income. For example, the childcare provider may choose to take the children in their care to the zoo, as an outing, but asks the parents to pay the admission fee charged by the zoo. The money received from the parents for the admission fee to the zoo is not regarded as gross income. The admission fee to the zoo will not be allowed as a deduction to the childcare provider.

Weekly variable standard-cost items
-----------------------------------

The basis of $3.09 per child per hour has been calculated in relation to their operation on a weekly basis.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Item of expenditure** | Cost ($) |
| Electricity/fuel | 11.59 |
| Food | 17.38 |
| Wear and tear | 11.59 |
| Outings and associated transport costs | 20.86 |
| Laundry | 9.27 |
| Educational resources | 8.11 |
| Modification costs | 5.79 |
| Equipment | 6.95 |
| First aid | 1.16 |
| TOTAL | 92.70 |
| **Based on 30 hours per week (rounded to the nearest cent)** | $3.09 |

**Explanation of weekly variable standard-cost items**

_Electricity/fuel_ - This covers the use of all appliances including the cost of heating, lighting and hot water. It includes other heating fuels such as gas, wood and coal.

_Food_ - This covers the cost of food that is supplied and includes basics such as bread, milk, fruit juice, biscuits and special dietary needs.

Owning/hiring of car seats for small children under the age of five is also a statutory requirement and is therefore included in this component. As mentioned in paragraph 15 of the Determination, the costs covered by parent contributions are not allowed as deductions against the caregivers gross income, and the contributions from parents are not regarded as income.

_Laundry -_ This not only covers obvious cleaning and laundry products but also rubber gloves, wet wipes, toilet paper and other similar items.

_Educational resources_ - These cover all related expenses and include items such as paper, paints, crayons, books, and other stationery items.

Application of the standard-cost basis as determined by the commissioner for childcare providers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**(Note: all the calculations are rounded to the nearest dollar.)**

**Example 1**

A childcare provider owns a domestic property. The purchase price of the domestic property is $200,000.The childcare provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances. Therefore, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost that the childcare provider may elect to deduct per annum is:  
\[($200,000 x 5%) \-($10 x 52)\] x 50% x 33.33% = $1,580.00

**Example 2**

A childcare provider rents a domestic property. The rent is $200 per week. The childcare provider receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week based on the location of the domestic accommodation and their individual circumstances. Therefore, the domestic accommodation fixed standard-cost that the childcare provider may elect to deduct per annum is:  
\[($200 x 52) \- ($20 x 52)\] x 50% x 33.33% = $1,560.00

**Example 3**

A childcare provider owns a domestic property, which costs $200,000. The childcare provider receives an accommodation supplement of $10 per week based on the location of the domestic property and their individual circumstances.

Amount of honoraria paid to members of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (Inc) that shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in production of payment
==========================================================================================================================================================

Determination DET 09/03 (2009) sets out the expenditure incurred in the production of schedular payments (honoraria) paid to members of the NZ Plunket Society.

This statement may be cited as "Determination 09/03: _Determination of expenditure incurred for honoraria payments made by the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (Inc)_".

This determination also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 21, No 6 (August 2009).

### Introduction

All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act").

This determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of schedular payments (formerly withholding payments) when those payments are honoraria paid to members of the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (Inc) ("Plunket").

Section RA 5 of the Act requires anyone who makes an employment-related payment to deduct tax when making it.

Under section RD 3(1) of the Act a schedular payment is included in the definition of "PAYE income payment". Consequently, any person who makes a schedular payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies.

Honoraria paid to Plunket members come within the definition of "schedular payment" under section RD 8 of the Act. Schedule 4, Part B of the Act requires PAYE to be deducted from honoraria at the rate of 33%.

Section RD 8(3) of the Act allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any schedular payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person making the schedular payment is only required to deduct tax from the amount that exceeds the determined expenditure amount.

### Application

This determination applies to payments made to Plunket members as reimbursement of costs incurred in undertaking Plunket related matters. It applies to honoraria paid on or after 1 April 2008.

This determination will apply until it is replaced or withdrawn.

### Determination

When any Plunket member receives honoraria as reimbursement of expenditure that member had incurred in carrying out Plunket related activities that payment, up to a maximum of $700 per annum, shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. However, if the member receives any reimbursement (in addition to honoraria) for expenditure they have incurred, the amount exempted under this determination ($700) shall be reduced by that additional reimbursement.

#### Examples

**Example 1**

A Plunket member receives honoraria of $500 in respect of the Plunket related activities carried out during the year. No other reimbursement had been paid during the year. The payer does not have to deduct withholding tax because the total payment does not exceed $700.

**Example 2**

A Plunket member receives a payment of $625 at the end of February. During the year, in May and August the member had also received two smaller payments of $100 each as reimbursement of expenses incurred for Plunket related activities, making a total of $825 for the year. Because the Plunket member had received reimbursement payments of $200 earlier in the year, only $500 of the honorarium received in February could be regarded as expenditure incurred under this determination. Therefore, tax of $41.25 should be deducted from the balance ($125) of the honorarium.

### Schedule to Determination DET 09/04:

### List of eligible relocation expenses

This list sets out the types of expenditure that may be treated as exempt income when an employee is reimbursed, or the expenditure is paid on an employee's behalf, when the employee (including their immediate family) relocate their accommodation for employment purposes.

"Immediate family" includes the employee's partner, dependent children and any dependent adults that are part of the employee's household. A dependent adult might be a dependent parent of the employee or partner or a disabled relative for whom the employee or the employee's partner is the caregiver.

The costs should be reasonable in the circumstances and, where relevant, should be as if they had been calculated on an arms-length basis between third parties.

Where there is a time limit specified on an item, that limit will be assumed to have been met for payments made prior to the issue of this determination.

Furthermore, the time limit on a specific item is subject to the overall time limit set in the legislation (that is, expenditure must have been incurred by the end of the tax year following that in which the relocation occurred).

DET 19/01 21 May 2019 UNCLASSIFIED DET 19/01: Standard-cost household service for private boarding service providers (21 May 2019) Reference This Determination is made under section 91AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). All legislative references are to the TAA unless otherwise stated. Explanation This Determination rescinds and replaces Determination 05/03: Standard-Cost Household Service for Boarding Service Providers (DET 05/03) and applies from the start of the 2019-20 income year. This Determination may be relevant to taxpayers who provide private boarding services in their home, if they have no more than four boarders at any time during the income year. This Determination sets standard costs that can be treated as expenditure incurred in deriving income from providing the boarding accommodation. For any income year, a taxpayer may choose to use these standard costs instead of their actual expenses, provided the criteria in this Determination are met. The standard costs consist of three elements: A taxpayer may include some or all of these elements (if applicable). (1) Weekly standard-cost per boarder This covers direct costs such as food and household bills. This is a set weekly amount per boarder. (2) Annual housing standard-cost This covers the costs for the use of the house in providing the accommodation, such as home loan interest, rates and insurance. This amount, if added in, is calculated under a formula set out in this Determination. (3) Transport standard-cost This covers the costs for the use of a motor vehicle in providing any transport to boarders. This amount, if added in, is calculated under a formula (which uses Inland Revenue’s kilometre rates) set out in this Determination. DET 19/01 2 UNCLASSIFIED However, if this Determination is used, actual costs cannot be used for expenditure covered by any of these elements, even if the standard-costs are not used for that particular element. If a taxpayer chooses to use the standard costs, income from providing the private boarding service will be exempt up to the amount of those costs. Income from providing the private boarding service will only need to be returned to the extent it exceeds the standard costs. Any additional costs related to providing the private boarding service cannot be deducted if they relate to an item covered by any of the elements comprising the standard costs. The Commissioner makes this Determination under section 91AA, on the basis that she considers it will result in a significant reduction in compliance costs for these taxpayers, without inappropriate: risk to the revenue, demand on the Commissioner’s resources, or inaccuracy for a significant number of taxpayers. The standard costs in this Determination can only be used by natural persons. Other limitations on who can use this Determination are set out in the next section, “Scope of Determination”. Scope of Determination Subject to the limitations below, this Determination applies to natural persons who provide private boarding services in their domestic accommodation. This Determination does not apply where: (a) the host has more than four boarders at the same time at any time during the income year: (b) the taxpayer does not choose to apply it: (c) the private boarding service is provided as part of a GST taxable activity of a registered person: (d) the domestic accommodation is trust property, unless the host either: (1) paid all of the costs represented by the annual housing standard-cost element for the income year; or (2) does not include the annual housing standard-cost element in their standard-costs for the income year: (e) the domestic accommodation is used in the income year to provide both a private boarding service and a short-stay accommodation service as defined in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers (21 May 2019) or any determination that replaces DET 19/02: (f) any other Determination made under section 91AA is applied for the income year in relation to the provision of services that require the use of the domestic accommodation: DET 19/01 3 UNCLASSIFIED (g) any deductions are claimed in relation to the use of the domestic accommodation in deriving income, for any time in the income year when the private boarding service is provided. Subject to any adjustment based on the annual movement of the Consumers Price Index as at the end of March each year, this Determination, unless specifically withdrawn, shall apply from the 2019-20 income year. Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires: • expressions used have the same meanings as those in sections CW 61 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 91AA; • boarder means a person provided with boarding accommodation in return for payment, but does not include a child under five years of age who accompanies a parent or guardian who is a boarder; • boarding accommodation means residential accommodation provided to boarders (often students) in conjunction with regular meals and other associated care, activities and benefits that usually or commonly occur in or are derived from a domestic (“family”) household, and does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, flatmates or care home residents, nor emergency accommodation or short-stay accommodation; • Consumers Price Index means the application of the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index to the weekly standard-cost per boarder; • domestic accommodation means a dwelling that is, or is part of, the principal residence of any boarding service host; • host means a natural person (which includes one or more natural persons living together in the same residence) who provides a private boarding service in their domestic accommodation; • private boarding service means all activities involved in the provision of boarding accommodation and associated care (including, for example, the provision of meals, laundry and other services or utilities a host typically provides to boarders); • short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks, that is not the paying guest’s ordinary residence, and does not include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, nor student or emergency accommodation; • standard-cost in relation to any private boarding service, means the standard cost that has been determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or calculated in accordance with the method determined by the DET 19/01 4 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner of Inland Revenue, for the purposes of this Determination, as referred to in section 91AA(2). Determination A private boarding service is a “standard-cost household service” for the purposes of section 91AA where the private boarding service involves the use of the host’s domestic accommodation. If this Determination applies, the standard costs that the taxpayer may treat as incurred by them in deriving exempt income and any assessable income from providing the standard-cost household service consist of three elements: (1) Weekly standard-cost per boarder; (2) Annual housing standard-cost; and (3) Annual transport standard-cost. For any income year, the taxpayer may include some or all of these three elements, which are defined below. However, if the domestic accommodation is trust property, the taxpayer cannot include the annual housing standard-cost element unless they have paid all of the costs represented by that element for the income year. If the taxpayer uses this Determination, actual costs cannot be used for expenditure covered by any of the standard-cost elements, even if the standard-costs are not used for that particular element. The total of whichever elements the taxpayer includes will be their standard-costs for the year. Income the taxpayer derives from providing the private boarding service will be exempt income up to the amount of their standard-costs for the year. Any income in excess of that amount that the taxpayer derives from providing the private boarding service will be assessable income. Standard cost elements The standard cost elements are as follows: (1) The weekly standard-cost per boarder The weekly standard-cost per boarder is \*$186. The weekly standard-cost per boarder represents the direct cost of providing private boarding services to each boarder on a weekly basis. It covers expenditure on items and services typically provided to boarders or related to provision of the private boarding service, such as: food; linen; laundry and cleaning services; power; telephone; internet; \* The Commissioner will review this amount based on the annual movement of the CPI as at the end of March each year. Inland Revenue will publish any CPI adjustment to the weekly standard-cost figure in its Tax Information Bulletin and on its website. DET 19/01 5 UNCLASSIFIED use of bedroom chattels and general household furniture; and incidentals such as gifts, leisure and entertainment activities provided by the host. (2) The annual housing standard-cost The annual housing standard-cost is calculated using the following formula: (a – b) × c × d Where – a is: • if the host owns the domestic accommodation, 4% of the cost of the domestic accommodation (including the cost of all capital improvements); • if the host rents the domestic accommodation, the total rent paid by the host for the domestic accommodation for the income year; • if the domestic accommodation is trust property, the total amount of financing costs or rent, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance paid by the host in relation to the domestic accommodation for the income year. b is the total accommodation supplement received by the host for the income year; c is the number of boarders relative to the number of total occupants living in the domestic accommodation during the period of the year the private boarding services are provided, expressed as a percentage; and d is the number of full weeks in the income year during which private boarding services were provided in the domestic accommodation, divided by 52. The annual housing standard-cost represents the cost for the use of the domestic accommodation in providing the private boarding service and covers (as relevant) expenditure on: financing costs (eg, home loan interest), rent, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance. (3) The annual transport standard-cost The annual transport standard-cost is calculated using the following formula: kilometre rate × kilometres travelled Where – kilometre rate is the motor vehicle kilometre rate(s) for the income year, set and published by the Commissioner from time to time for the purposes of DET 19/01 6 UNCLASSIFIED section DE 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, applied firstly to business use of the motor vehicle that does not relate to the provision of the private boarding service and secondly to the “kilometres travelled” as defined in this Determination; and kilometres travelled is the total number of kilometres travelled by the host for the income year, in a motor vehicle for which the host incurs the running costs, in trips for which the dominant purpose relates to the provision of the private boarding service. The annual transport standard-cost represents the cost for the use of a motor vehicle in providing the private boarding service, and covers expenditure on fuel, insurance, registration, warrants of fitness, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. All three standard-cost elements for private boarding service hosts are calculated, or must be calculated, inclusive of GST, if any. This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This Determination is signed on the 21 st day of May 2019.

If you have a boarder in your home, the starting point is that the income you receive from them is taxable, and your expenses that relate to earning the income are deductible. 3. You can keep track of your actual costs associated with having the boarder (like your home loan interest or rent, utility bills, food etc), and use that as the basis for your deductions. However, most of your actual costs would only be partly deductible. This is because they are your private household costs and will only partly relate to earning the boarding income. Therefore, you would need to apportion those costs appropriately, and only deduct the relevant portion. 4. Alternatively, you may be able to use the Determination, which sets standard costs for your deductions. The standard costs reflect the expenses you are likely to incur in having boarders. This approach is simpler than using your actual costs and apportioning them where necessary, and for many boarding hosts this approach will mean there is no need to file a tax return (eg, if you don’t have other income you need to file a tax return for). 5. If you use the standard costs in the Determination, there are three elements that you may be able to include: Element 1: Weekly standard-cost per boarder Element 2: Annual housing standard-cost Element 3: Annual transport standard-cost 6. You can include some or all of these elements, but you may not need to include more than one or two to cover your boarding income. Note: “Boarders” are people (often students) who live with you, essentially as part of your household. They are provided with accommodation, regular meals and other associated care, activities or benefits that are typical in a family household. Flatmates, tenants, short-stay accommodation guests and the like are not considered boarders, so are not within the scope of the Determination. Note: For most people, the total of your weekly standard-costs and your annual housing costs will be more than your boarding income. In this case, you won’t need to include the boarding income in your tax return, and you won’t need to add your annual transport costs (if any). See Appendix D for help estimating whether your boarding income will likely be covered by your weekly and housing standard costs. Commentary on DET 19/01 3 UNCLASSIFIED Who can use the Determination 7. You can choose to use the standard-costs in the Determination if: • you are a natural person (eg, an individual not a company); • you did not have more than four boarders at the same time at any time during the income year; • you do not provide the private boarding service as part of a GST taxable activity; • the property is not held in a trust, or if it is, you either: (1) paid all of the financing costs, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance for the property for the income year; or (2) do not include the annual housing standard-cost element in your standard-costs for the income year; • your home isn’t used in the income year to provide both a private boarding service and a short-stay accommodation service (as defined in DET 19/02: Standard-cost household service for short-stay accommodation providers or any determination that replaces DET 19/02); • neither you nor anyone else applies any other standard-cost household service determination in relation to services provided in your home (for example, DET 09/02: Standard-Cost Household Service for Childcare Providers); and • no deductions are claimed in relation to the use of the domestic accommodation in deriving income, for any time in the income year when the private boarding service is provided. Q: Why can’t the Determination be used by people who have both boarders and short-stay accommodation guests in their home? A: The standard-costs in both the boarders Determination (DET 19/01) and the short-stay accommodation Determination (DET 19/02) include amounts for the use of common areas of the home in providing the accommodation (eg, home loan interest or rent, insurance and rates, utility costs, and depreciation of household chattels). If hosts could use one or both of the Determinations, there would be a “doubling up” of deductibility for some of the expenditure covered by the standard-costs. Therefore, if hosts have both boarders and short-stay accommodation guests in their home, they must base their deductions on their actual expenses, apportioned appropriately. For most people the income year is 1 April – 31 March Commentary on DET 19/01 4 UNCLASSIFIED Your options 8. If you meet the above criteria, you may choose to use either the “standard-cost basis” or the “actual-cost basis”. These approaches are summarised in figure 1. Figure 1: Difference between standard-cost basis and actual-cost basis 9. As noted in \[3\] and Figure 1, if you choose to use the actual-cost basis, some of your expenses will need to be apportioned, as they will not relate solely to the provision of the boarding service (for example, food, power bills, and home loan interest). You will need to apportion these sorts of expenses on a fair and reasonable basis – for example, having regard to things like the period of year during which you have boarders, the average number of boarders relative to the total number of occupants in your home, and the floor areas of different parts of your home. 10. For each income year, provided you meet the criteria in \[7\], you need to decide which approach you want to use. If you do not meet the criteria for a particular year, you will not have a choice about which approach to use for that year – you will have to use the actual-cost basis for your deductions. 11. Whether you use the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis, you need to keep sufficient records to support your tax position (see \[49\]). The standard-cost basis Use some or all of the standard- cost elements in the Determination (summarised at \[2\]) as the amount you can offset against your income from providing the private boarding service. You can’t use any of your actual expenses for items covered by any of the standard-cost elements (whether or not you’ve included that element). The actual-cost basis If you take this approach, you deduct your actual expenses related to earning the boarding income. Many expenses will need to be apportioned, because they partly relate to having boarders and are partly just your private household costs. OR Commentary on DET 19/01 5 UNCLASSIFIED Income tax implications of using the standard-cost basis 12. If you choose to use the standard-cost basis: • Income you make from providing the private boarding service will be exempt income up to the amount of the standard-costs calculated under the Determination. • Any income in excess of those costs that you make from providing the private boarding service will be assessable income, and you will need to include it in a tax return. • If your income from providing the private boarding service does not exceed the standard-costs, you will not need to file a tax return on account of providing the private boarding service, but you may need to for some other reason (for example, if you have other income or losses). • You will not be able to deduct your actual costs for items of expenditure covered by any of the elements comprising the standard-costs, even if the standard-costs are not used for that particular element (the items covered by each of the standard-cost elements are noted in the next section “Standard- cost elements and what items they cover”). • Any additional cost that does not relate to an item covered by any of the elements comprising the standard-costs in the Determination and is not a capital cost would only be deductible to the extent it has a sufficient connection to deriving income and is not private in nature. If a cost relates both to earning income and the private use of your home, an appropriate apportionment would need to be made. Standard-cost elements and the items they cover (1) The weekly standard-cost per boarder 13. The weekly standard-cost per boarder represents the direct day-to-day expenses involved in having boarders. 14. This is a set amount per boarder – for the 2019-20 income year it is $186 per boarder per week, subject to CPI adjustment. Inland Revenue will CPI adjust the weekly standard-cost amount each year for inflation and publish the updated amount in its Tax Information Bulletin and on its website. 15. As noted in the Determination, the weekly standard-cost per boarder covers expenditure on items and services typically provided to boarders or related to provision of the private boarding service such as: food; linen; laundry and cleaning services; power; telephone; internet; use of bedroom chattels and general household furniture; and incidentals such as gifts, leisure and entertainment activities provided by the host. Commentary on DET 19/01 6 UNCLASSIFIED 16. The weekly standard-cost per boarder has been calculated based on data from Statistics New Zealand, current market values of chattels typically provided for boarders’ use by private boarding service hosts, and estimates of bedroom sizes relative to average New Zealand house sizes (based on data from Quotable Valuation NZ). 17. The weekly standard-cost per boarder in the Determination is not intended as a guide to the amount hosts can or should charge for the private boarding service, but rather reflects the expenditure Inland Revenue considers likely to be incurred by hosts for the items covered by the weekly standard-cost element. 18. If your income from boarders is no more than the weekly standard-cost per boarder, you won’t have to return any boarding income, or do any calculations – the income will be treated as exempt. 19. If your boarding income is more than the weekly standard-cost element, you can choose to either: ➢ File a tax return for the year that includes the amount of boarding income over the amount of your total weekly standard-costs. or ➢ Calculate your “annual housing standard-cost” and/or your “annual transport standard-cost” and add either or both of those to your weekly standard-costs. See “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” for help with this. If you choose to do this, the total of whichever elements you include will be your total standard-costs for the income year. You will only need to return boarding income to the extent (if any) it exceeds your total standard-costs for the year. (2) The annual housing standard-cost 20. The annual housing standard-cost reflects that there is a cost involved in you using your home to provide the private boarding service. 21. As noted in the Determination, the annual housing standard-cost covers (as relevant) expenditure on financing costs (eg, home loan interest), rent, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance. 22. If you add this element, use the formula on page 5 of the Determination to calculate a figure that represents these costs. Page 4 of “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” will help you calculate these costs. 23. While there is a calculation to perform, using the Determination and calculating this element to include in your standard-costs may be a simpler approach than identifying and apportioning your actual costs – which you would have to do if you use the actual-cost basis rather than the Determination. Commentary on DET 19/01 7 UNCLASSIFIED 24. The annual housing standard-cost calculation is based on: (a) the actual cost to you of acquiring and making capital improvements to your home, or the cost of renting your home; (b) the average number of boarders relative to the number of total occupants living in your home during the period of the year you had boarders (expressed as a percentage); and (c) the proportion of the income year during which you had boarders. 25. The discussion from paragraph \[26\] explains what you include in terms of your costs – depending on whether you own your home, rent your home, or it is trust property, and whether you receive an accommodation supplement. Appendix A explains who should be counted as a boarder or an occupant, and the examples in Appendix C illustrate how to work out the average number of boarders relative to total occupants and the proportion of the income year during which you had boarders. Costs if you own your home 26. If you own your home, 4% of the cost of the home (including the cost of all capital improvements) is included. You have to use the purchase price from when you bought your home, not the rateable value or current market value. Capital improvements include things such as extending your home, but do not include general repairs and maintenance. The 4% figure represents the typical expenditure incurred in owning a residential property, including outgoings such as rates, insurance, home loan interest, and repairs and maintenance. Costs if you rent your home 27. If you rent your home, the actual amount of the rent you paid for the year is included. Costs if your home is trust property 28. If your home is trust property, you can only add in the annual housing standard- cost element if you paid all of the financing costs, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance for the property for the income year. If the trustees paid any of these expenses, you can’t add in the annual housing standard-cost element. 29. If you paid all of the above expenses and add this element to your standard costs, the annual housing standard-cost formula requires you to use your actual expenses in relation to the property (that is, the actual amount you paid in home loan interest or rent, in insurance premiums and rates, and for repairs and maintenance). If you receive an accommodation supplement 30. You may receive an accommodation supplement from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Eligibility for an accommodation supplement is assessed by Commentary on DET 19/01 8 UNCLASSIFIED MSD, based on factors such as accommodation costs, income, assets, whether you have dependents, and your employment status. 31. If you receive an accommodation supplement, it is subtracted in calculating your annual housing standard-costs under the Determination. Example C4 in Appendix C shows how receipt of an accommodation supplement affects the calculation of the annual housing standard-costs. (3) The annual transport standard-cost 32. If you use your motor vehicle in providing the boarding service (for example, to take a boarder to activities), you may add this element to your standard-costs. 33. The annual transport standard-cost reflects that there is a cost involved in you using your vehicle in providing the private boarding service. 34. As noted in the Determination, the annual transport standard-cost covers expenditure on fuel, insurance, registration, warrants of fitness, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation. 35. If you add this element, use the formula on page 5 of the Determination to calculate a figure that represents the above costs. Page 5 of “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” will help you with this calculation. 36. While there is a calculation to perform, using the Determination and calculating this element to include in your standard-costs may be a simpler approach than identifying and apportioning your actual costs – which you would have to do if you use the actual-cost basis rather than the Determination. 37. The annual transport standard-cost is an annual calculation, based on: (a) Inland Revenue’s kilometre rates for motor vehicles (which are re-set and published from time to time); and (b) the number of kilometres you travelled in the income year, in a motor vehicle that you pay the running costs for, for trips where the dominant purpose related to you providing the private boarding service. Note: Appendix B provides guidance on when the dominant purpose of a motor vehicle trip would relate to your provision of the private boarding service, which will be relevant if you’re adding the annual transport standard-cost element. See OS 18/01: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for business running of a motor vehicle for more information on using Inland Revenue’s kilometre rates. Commentary on DET 19/01 9 UNCLASSIFIED Using the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis The standard-cost basis 38. If you choose to use the standard-cost basis for any given income year, you do this by either: ➢ Not including the exempt income in a tax return for that income year, if you are required to file a return (for example, if your boarding income is more than your standard-costs, or if you have income from another source that means you need to file a return). o The exempt income is your income from providing the private boarding service, up to the amount of your standard-costs calculated under the Determination. o If your boarding income is more than your standard-costs, you will need to include the income above the amount of your standard-costs in your return. OR ➢ Not filing a tax return for the income year, if your income from providing the private boarding service is not more than your standard-costs calculated under the Determination, and you do not otherwise have to file a return. The actual-cost basis 39. If you choose to use the actual-cost basis, you must return all income from providing the private boarding service, and your deductions must be based on the expenses you actually incur in providing the service. When you need to make your choice 40. You can make your choice about whether to use the standard-cost basis or the actual-cost basis at any time up to the due date for filing a return. 41. You should keep adequate records of your actual costs related to providing the private boarding service, as you may not know before the end of the income year whether you will meet the criteria to be able to use the standard-cost basis. If you cannot use the standard-cost basis (for example, if you had more than four boarders at any time during the income year), or if you choose not to, you will need those records to support claiming deductions when you file a return. Consumers Price Index 42. Inland Revenue will make an annual adjustment to the weekly standard-cost per boarder figure, by applying the annual movement of the All Groups Consumers Price Index to the elements included in that standard-cost figure. Commentary on DET 19/01 10 UNCLASSIFIED 43. Inland Revenue will publish the revised weekly standard-cost figure, as at the end of March each year, in its Tax Information Bulletin and on its website. GST 44. You cannot use the standard-costs in the Determination if you provide the private boarding service as part of a GST taxable activity. Therefore, anyone who uses the standard-cost basis will not be eligible to claim back GST charged on goods and services consumed. As such, the weekly standard-cost per boarder determined by the Commissioner has been prepared on a GST-inclusive basis. Similarly, you must calculate the annual housing standard-cost and the annual transport standard-cost (if you use them) on a GST-inclusive basis. Reimbursements 45. If you receive reimbursements for specific additional costs not covered by the standard-costs (for example, payment received from a boarder for monthly train passes you have purchased for them), these reimbursements are not treated as income for you, and the costs are not treated as a deductible expense incurred by you. Returning income 46. If you’re using the Determination, whether you need to return income from providing the private boarding service depends on whether the income is more than your allowable standard-costs for the year. 47. If you’re using the Determination, Flowchart 1 (on page 12) will help you work out if you need to return any boarding income. 48. Where there is more than one host providing the private boarding services, the income from boarders and the standard costs calculated under the Determination should be split evenly between the hosts, unless there are reasonable grounds for a different split. Record keeping 49. Whether you use the Determination or not, you must keep sufficient records to support your tax position. This would include records of: • the number of weeks of the year you had boarders; • how much income you made from boarders; • the number of other occupants in your home during the year; • the cost of any capital improvements you made to the property in the year or the amount of rent you paid for the property during the year; Commentary on DET 19/01 11 UNCLASSIFIED • the number of kilometres you travelled in the year, in a motor vehicle that you pay the running costs for, for trips where the dominant purpose related to your provision of the private boarding service; and • any expenses you are able to deduct if you cannot or choose not to use the Determination. Note: You should keep records of all expenses even if you think you will use the standard-costs in the Determination, as you may not know until the end of the year whether you will definitely be able to do so. Commentary on DET 19/01 12 UNCLASSIFIED Flowchart 1: Using the determination – do I have to return income? Yes Is your income from boarders for the year more than the weekly standard-cost? (\*$186 per boarder per week) No Do you want to calculate the annual housing standard-cost and/or the annual transport standard-cost? Is your total income from boarders more than the total of all the standard-cost elements you have calculated? No Yes Calculate Your “annual housing standard-cost” and/or Your “annual transport standard-cost” See “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” The amount of your boarding income over the total amount of all of the standard- cost elements you have calculated is taxable. Include it in a tax return. You can’t claim any losses from providing the boarding service. Your boarding income isn’t taxable. Don’t include it in a tax return. You can’t claim any losses from providing the boarding service. Your boarding income over the amount of your weekly standard-costs is taxable. Include it in a tax return. You can’t claim any losses from providing the boarding service. Your boarding income isn’t taxable. Don’t include it in a tax return. You can’t claim any losses from providing the boarding service. No Yes \* The weekly standard-cost is set by Inland Revenue and CPI adjusted each year. For 2019-20 it has been set at $186 per boarder per week, subject to CPI adjustment. Commentary on DET 19/01 13 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix A: Number of boarders and number of total occupants A1. If you’re including the annual housing standard-cost element, you’ll need to work out what proportion of the year you had boarders, and the number of boarders and the number of total occupants living in your home during the year. A2. The calculation involves working out the number of weeks for which boarding services were provided and (where family members come and go during the year) a fair estimate of the average number of occupants in your home during the year. A3. Where a child accompanies a parent or guardian who is a boarder in a private boarding service arrangement: ➢ If the child is under 5 years old, don’t count them as an occupant (for the annual housing standard-cost calculation) or as a boarder (for the weekly standard-cost calculation). ➢ If the child is 5-18 years old and there is no separate charge for their keep, don’t count them as an occupant for the annual housing standard- cost calculation. A4. Similarly, if a host has a child under 5 years of age living with them, the child shouldn’t be counted as an occupant for the annual housing standard-cost calculation. A5. If you, as a host, have a shared-care arrangement for a child over 5 years of age, the child’s occupancy should be based on the percentage of the year the child typically lives with you. For example, with a 50:50 shared-care arrangement, a child over the age of five should be counted as half (0.5) an occupant. There is no need to keep track of the number of nights in the year the child actually stayed with you – you can base the child’s occupancy on whatever the typical shared-care arrangement is. If the shared-care is informal and fluid, Inland Revenue will accept a reasonable estimate based on the usual arrangements, which may be a 50:50 basis (so counting the child as half (0.5) an occupant). The same approach should be applied if you have a dependent child who is absent from the household while attending boarding school or living elsewhere for some of the year. A6. Family visitors and guests accommodated without charge on a short-term stay are not counted as occupants (for the standard-cost calculation) or as boarders (for the weekly standard-cost calculation). Commentary on DET 19/01 14 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix B: Dominant purpose test for claiming transport B1. If you’re including the annual transport standard-cost element, you’ll need to work out the number of kilometres you are allowed to include in your calculation. B2. The kilometres you can include in the annual transport standard-cost calculation are the total number of kilometres you travelled in the income year: • in a motor vehicle you pay the running costs for; • where the dominant purpose of the trip related to the provision of the private boarding service. B3. The annual transport standard-cost reflects that there is a cost involved in you using your vehicle in providing the private boarding service. B4. To include the annual transport standard-cost element, the requirement to provide transport to the boarder should be part of the boarding agreement. This is likely to be more common for private boarding services provided to young international students. B5. For a trip to be included, the dominant purpose of the trip must have been to transport the boarder. It doesn’t matter if other people were also transported at the same time – as long as the dominant purpose was to transport the boarder, you can claim the trip. B6. You can’t apportion the kilometres travelled in trips where the boarder was transported but this was not the dominant purpose – you may not claim any kilometres for those trips. B7. You must maintain a log book or similar record to support the number of kilometres claimed for the year. The three-month log book test period should not be used unless it produces an accurate representative result. Examples B8. Examples B1 – B5 illustrate the dominant purpose test for claiming transport, using the same family situation. Example B1 Lauren and Russell have an arrangement to house and care for an international student (Virat, age 13). Part of that arrangement requires Lauren and Russell to take Virat to local attractions. Lauren and Russell decide to take Virat to their local zoo during the weekend. They also take their own children, Oscar and Arlo. Although the whole family is being transported to the zoo, the dominant purpose of the trip is to take Virat there. Therefore, all of the kilometres travelled on the trip can be claimed. Example B2 While Virat is in New Zealand, he attends the same school as Oscar and Arlo. Lauren and Russell usually transport Oscar and Arlo to school, so they transport Virat to school at the same time. The dominant purpose of the journey is to take Commentary on DET 19/01 15 UNCLASSIFIED their own children to school, not to transport Virat. Therefore, none of the kilometres travelled on these trips can be claimed. Example B3 Virat plays cricket. Lauren and Russell take him to his cricket matches each weekend. These trips are related to providing the boarding services. It doesn’t matter who else travels in the vehicle at the same time (for example, if Oscar and Arlo go along to watch the match). The dominant purpose of the trip is to transport Virat. Therefore, all of the kilometres travelled on these trips can be claimed. Example B4 The family visits Grandma for her birthday and takes Virat with them for the family experience and because he is too young to be left at home alone. While the trip involves Virat, the dominant purpose of the trip is for the family to visit Grandma. Therefore, none of the kilometres travelled on the trip can be claimed. Example B5 Trips to the local supermarket are simply part of the normal weekly shop for the family groceries, irrespective of whether specific items may have also been purchased for the boarder at the supermarket (for example, because Virat needed more toiletries). The dominant purpose of these trips isn’t related to the provision of the boarding services. Therefore, none of the kilometres travelled on these trips can be claimed. Commentary on DET 19/01 16 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix C: Examples of using the standard-costs in the Determination For all these examples, it is presumed that the eligibility criteria for the Determination are met, and the taxpayer has decided to use the standard-cost basis. Example C1 – Boarding income less than weekly standard-cost Lynn has one student boarding in her home. The boarder pays $180 per week for the full year. Lynn doesn’t have any other boarders. As the weekly board Lynn receives is less than the determined weekly standard-cost per boarder ($186), Lynn isn’t required to return the income. Example C2 – Multiple boarders with income less than weekly standard-cost Bailey and Lorin are both university students. They live at home with their parents, and each pays $100 per week for board. There are no other private boarders. As the board Bailey and Lorin’s parents get is less than the determined weekly standard-cost per boarder ($186) they aren’t required to return the income. Example C3 – Incorporating annual housing standard-cost for own property Gavin owns his family’s home, which he purchased five years ago for $550,000. He hasn’t made any capital improvements to the property. Gavin and his partner Jenny have one boarder, who pays $250 per week for the full year. Gavin and Jenny also have a teenage son who lives with them full time, so there is a total of 4 occupants in the home for the year. As the weekly board exceeds the weekly standard-cost per boarder ($186), Gavin uses the worksheet “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” and calculates the annual housing standard-cost element as follows: The following example illustrates a situation where only the weekly standard-cost is used. The following examples illustrate situations where both the weekly standard-cost and the annual housing standard-cost are used. Note: These examples use the weekly standard-cost amount of $186 that’s been set for the 2019-20 income year, subject to CPI adjustment. Inland Revenue will make a CPI adjustment to the weekly standard-cost figure each year, and will publish the revised figure as at the end of March each year. Commentary on DET 19/01 17 UNCLASSIFIED (a – b) × c × d a Because Gavin owns his home, “a” is 4% of the cost of the home: 4% of $550,000 = $22,000. b Gavin doesn’t receive an accommodation supplement, so “b” is 0. c The average number of boarders relative to the total number of occupants for the period the boarder is there (the whole year) is 1 out of 4, so “c” is 25%. d The boarder is accommodated for the full year, so “d” is 1 (the number of weeks in the year the boarder is there (52) divided by 52 weeks in the year). Therefore, Gavin calculates that his annual housing standard-cost is $5,500: ($22,000 – 0) × 25% × 1 = $5,500 Gavin adds together the weekly standard-cost he is allowed per week per boarder ($186 × 52 = $9,672) and his annual housing standard-cost of $5,500. The total standard- cost Gavin uses, combining these elements, is $15,172. The total board Gavin and Jenny receive for the year is $13,000 ($250 × 52). As this is less than the total standard-cost Gavin has calculated, he and Jenny aren’t required to return any of the boarding income – it is exempt income. Example C4 – Incorporating annual housing standard-cost for rented property with accommodation supplement Suzie rents her home, paying $450 per week in rent. She receives an accommodation supplement of $20 per week. Suzie has an international student boarding for a six-month period during the year. Suzie has an 8-year-old child, who lives with her full time. Therefore, for the six-month period the boarder is staying, there are three occupants in the household, and for the other six-month period there are two. The boarder pays $200 per week in board. As the weekly board exceeds the weekly standard-cost per boarder ($186), Suzie uses the worksheet “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” and calculates the annual housing standard-cost element as follows: (a – b) × c × d a Because Suzie rents her home, “a” is the total rent she paid in the year: $450 × 52 = $23,400. b Suzie received an accommodation supplement in the year, so “b” is the total amount of the accommodation supplement for the year: $1,040. c The average percentage of boarders relative to total occupants for the period the boarder is there (half of the year) is 33.33% − this is “c”. d The boarder is accommodated for half of the year, so “d” is 0.5 (the number of weeks in the year the boarder is there (26) divided by 52 weeks in the year). Commentary on DET 19/01 18 UNCLASSIFIED Therefore, Suzie calculates that her annual housing standard-cost is $3,726.29: ($23,400 – $1,040) × 33.33% × 0.5 = $3,726.29 Suzie adds together the weekly standard-cost she is allowed per week per boarder ($186 × 26 = $4,836) and her annual housing standard-cost of $3,726.29. The total standard- cost Suzie uses, combining these elements, is $8,562.29. The total board Suzie receives for the year is $5,200 ($200 × 26). As this is less than the total standard-cost Suzie has calculated, she isn’t required to return any of the boarding income – it is exempt income. Example C5 – Incorporating annual housing standard-cost for multiple boarders for own property Meredith owns her home, which she purchased 20 years ago for $100,000. She hasn’t made any capital improvements to the property. Over the year, Meredith and her partner Mai have three boarders, who live in the household at different periods of the year. One permanent boarder pays $180 per week for the full year, and two boarders each pay $250 per week for six months (26 weeks) in the second half of the year. There are three occupants in the household for half of the year, increasing to five in the second half of the year when the two additional boarders are there. Meredith and Mai don’t provide any transport services to the boarders as part of the private boarding service arrangements. The total board received for the year was $22,360: ($180 × 52) + ($250 × 26 × 2) = $22,360 The weekly-standard cost Meredith is allowed is $19,344: ($186 × 52) + ($186 × 26 × 2) = $19,344 As the total board received exceeds the weekly standard-cost, Meredith uses the worksheet “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” and calculates the annual housing standard-cost element as follows (calculating each six-month period separately, because the number of boarders differed in each period): (a – b) × c × d a Because Meredith owns her home, “a” is 4% of the cost of the home: 4% of $100,000 = $4,000. b Meredith doesn’t receive an accommodation supplement, so “b” is 0. c For the first six-month period (when there is just one boarder), the average percentage of boarders relative to total occupants, “c”, is 33.33%. For the second six-month period (when there are three boarders), the average percentage of boarders relative to total occupants, “c”, is 60%. Commentary on DET 19/01 19 UNCLASSIFIED d For the first six-month period (when there is just one boarder), the number of full weeks the boarder is there is 26 (the whole six-month period), so “d” is 0.5 (26 divided by 52). Likewise for the second six-month period (during which there are also boarders for 26 weeks). Therefore, Meredith calculates that her annual housing standard-cost is $1,860: For the first six-month period: ($4,000 – 0) × 33% × 0.5 = $660 For the second six-month period: ($4,000 – 0) × 60% × 0.5 = $1,200 Therefore, total annual housing standard cost = $1,860 Meredith adds together the weekly standard-cost she is allowed ($19,344) and her annual housing standard-cost of $1,860. The total standard-cost Meredith uses, combining these elements, is $21,204. As noted above, the total board Meredith and Mai receive for the year is $22,360. As this is more than the total standard-cost Meredith has calculated, she and Mai must return any boarding income that exceeds the total standard-costs. Therefore, the amount to be returned is $1,156 ($22,360 – $21,204). Although Meredith owns the home, the boarding services are provided by both Meredith and Mai, so the amount to be returned should be split so each returns half ($578). Example C6 – Incorporating all three standard-costs for own property Matai and Roimata provide boarding services to Joan and her four-year-old son for $250 per week. Matai and Roimata and their two children aged under five occupy the home full time, and Matai’s teenage daughter from a previous relationship lives with them 50% of the time. Matai’s teenage daughter is counted as “half” an occupant (0.5), because she lives there half the time. Joan doesn’t have a car, so part of the boarding arrangement is that Roimata will drive Joan to her work and Joan’s son to day-care, and pick them up at the end of the day. This is a 5km round-trip for each drop off and pick up – so a total of 10km for each day Joan works. Joan worked on 240 days during the year. Roimata keeps a log book for the year, recording the days on which she makes these trips. Roimata’s car travels less than 14,000 kilometres during the year. The following example illustrates a situation where the weekly standard-cost, the annual housing standard-cost and the annual transport standard-cost are all used. Note: This example uses the kilometre rates that have been set for the 2018-19 income year. Inland Revenue adjusts the kilometre rates each year, and publishes the revised figures as at the end of March each year on the Inland Revenue website. Commentary on DET 19/01 20 UNCLASSIFIED Matai purchased the home for $150,000 ten years ago. He hasn’t made any capital improvements to the property. Matai and Roimata receive no accommodation supplement. In this situation, one boarder pays $250 per week for board for the full year – Joan’s son is not counted as a boarder as he is under five years old. The household is treated as consisting of 3.5 total occupants – Matai, Roimata and Joan, and Matai’s daughter as “half” an occupant. The three children under five years old are not counted as occupants. As the weekly board exceeds the weekly standard-cost per boarder ($186), Matai and Roimata use the worksheet “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” and calculate the annual housing standard-cost element as follows: (a – b) × c × d a Because Matai owns the home, “a” is 4% of the cost of the home: 4% of $150,000 = $6,000. b Matai and Roimata don’t receive an accommodation supplement, so “b” is 0. c The average percentage of boarders relative to total occupants for the period the boarder is there (the whole year), “c”, is 28.57%. d The boarder is accommodated for the full year, so “d” is 1 (the number of weeks in the year the boarder is there (52) divided by 52 weeks in the year). Therefore, Matai and Roimata calculate that their annual housing standard-cost is $1,714.20: ($6,000 – 0) × 28.57% × 1 = $1,714.20 Matai and Roimata add together the weekly standard-cost they are allowed per week per boarder ($186 × 52 = $9,672) and their annual housing standard-cost of $1,714.20. The total of these two elements is $11,386.20. The total board Matai and Roimata receive for the year is $13,000 ($250 × 52). As this is more than the weekly standard-cost element and the annual housing standard-cost element combined ($11,386.20), Matai and Roimata calculate their annual transport standard-cost. They can add this element as Roimata provides transport to Joan (and her son) as part of the boarding arrangement. The dominant purpose of the trips, dropping Joan to work and her son to day-care and picking them up again at the end of the day, is related to the provision of the private boarding service, so the kilometres travelled on these trips can be claimed for. Matai and Roimata use the worksheet “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” and calculate the annual transport standard-cost element as follows: kilometre rate × kilometres travelled kilometre The relevant motor vehicle kilometre rates for the year (set by the Commentary on DET 19/01 21 UNCLASSIFIED rate Commissioner of Inland Revenue) are 79 cents per km for the first 14,000 km, and 30 cents per km for any kilometres over 14,000 km. kilometres The total kilometres travelled where the dominant purpose of the trip travelled related to providing the boarding services is 2,400 km (10km on each day Joan worked multiplied by the 240 days on which she worked). Therefore, Matai and Roimata calculate that their annual transport standard-cost is $1,896: 2,400 × 0.79 = $1,896 Matai and Roimata add together their weekly standard-cost of $9,672, their annual housing standard-cost of $1,714.20, and their annual transport standard-cost of $1,896. The total of the three elements is $13,282.20. As noted above, the total board Matai and Roimata receive for the year is $13,000 ($250 × 52). As this is less than the total standard-cost Matai and Roimata have calculated, they aren’t required to return any of the boarding income – it is exempt income. Commentary on DET 19/01 22 UNCLASSIFIED Appendix D: Examples of checking a boarding rate to see if you’re likely to have tax obligations for your boarding income For all these examples, it is presumed that the eligibility criteria for the Determination are met, and the taxpayer has decided to use the standard-cost basis. D1. The examples in Appendix C show how to calculate whether there is a tax liability at the end of the year. However, you may want to check in advance of getting a boarder that the rate you plan to charge will likely be covered by your weekly and housing standard-costs, so you can be reasonably confident about whether you’ll have tax obligations for your boarding income at the end of the tax year. D2. While you can estimate this, bear in mind that you may end up having tax obligations at the end of the year for some of your boarding income if any of the following things happen: • the number of occupants of your home who aren’t boarders (and who are over 5 years of age) increases during the year; • your rent (if you rent your home) decreases during the year; or • you start receiving an accommodation supplement during the year, or get an increase in any accommodation supplement you already receive. D3. The following examples explain how you can estimate whether the rate you plan to charge a boarder will likely be covered by your weekly and housing standard- costs, so you can be reasonably confident about whether you’ll have tax obligations for your boarding income at the end of the tax year. Example D1 – Hosts own their home Ashan and Lisa have decided to get a boarder, as they have a spare room. They are planning to charge about $280 per week in board. They would prefer not to have any tax obligations at the end of the year for the boarding income, so they want to estimate if their likely standard-costs would cover their boarding income if they set the board at that level. Ashan and Lisa bought their home for $460,000. They do not receive an accommodation supplement. Provided it is just Ashan, Lisa and the boarder living in the house, and Ashan and Lisa do not start receiving an accommodation supplement, the housing standard-cost that could be used for each week the boarder is there would be $117. This is calculated as follows: • For hosts who own their home, the housing standard-cost is based on 4% of the cost of the property. Note: These examples use the weekly standard-cost amount of $186 that’s been set for the 2019-20 income year, subject to CPI adjustment. Inland Revenue will make a CPI adjustment to the weekly standard-cost figure each year, and will publish the revised figure as at the end of March each year. Commentary on DET 19/01 23 UNCLASSIFIED • 4% of $460,000 = $18,400. • With Ashan, Lisa and one boarder living in the house, 1 3 of the $18,400 (or $6,133) would be the annual housing standard-cost Ashan and Lisa could use if the boarder was there for 52 weeks. • The annual amount of $6,133 can be converted to a weekly amount, by dividing it by 52. • On a weekly basis, the housing amount would therefore be $117. • When this is added to the weekly standard-cost of $186, Ashan and Lisa’s total estimated standard-cost converted to a weekly amount would be $303 per week ($186 + $117). This would mean that Ashan and Lisa’s proposed boarding charge of $280 per week would be covered by their estimated standard-costs ($303 per week). Provided the circumstances don’t change during the year (in particular, see the three bullet points at para D2), Ashan and Lisa can be confident they would not have any tax obligations for their boarding income if the board is set at the level they are proposing. Ashan and Lisa would not need to work out their transport standard-costs as their income from boarding is covered by the weekly costs and housing costs. Example D2 – Hosts own their own home and may wish to keep track of transport (if provided) to add on the transport standard-cost This example assumes the same facts as Example 1, but with Ashan and Lisa having two teenage children who still live at home. Because there are more occupants in the home, the housing standard-cost would be less than in Example 1. This reflects that the housing expenses are effectively split between the number of occupants in the house. With the boarder being one of five people living in the house, only 1 5 of the total housing cost figure in the formula could be used. The housing standard-cost that could be used for each week the boarder is there would be $70.77. This is calculated as follows: • For hosts who own their home, the housing standard-cost is based on 4% of the cost of the property. • 4% of $460,000 = $18,400. • With Ashan, Lisa, their two teenage children and one boarder living in the house, 1 5 of the $18,400 (or $3,680) would be the annual housing standard-cost Ashan and Lisa could use if the boarder was there for 52 weeks. • The annual amount of $3,680 can be converted to a weekly amount, by dividing it by 52. • On a weekly basis, the housing amount would therefore be $70.77. Commentary on DET 19/01 24 UNCLASSIFIED • When this is added to the weekly standard-cost of $186, Ashan and Lisa’s total estimated standard-cost converted to a weekly amount would be $256.77 per week ($186 + $70.77). This would mean that Ashan and Lisa’s proposed boarding charge of $280 per week would not be covered by their estimated weekly and housing standard-costs ($256.77 per week). Ashan and Lisa therefore may have tax obligations for some of their boarding income if the board is set at the level they are proposing. Adding on transport costs If Ashan and Lisa’s boarding agreement requires them to provide transport to the boarder, they may wish to keep track of the number of kilometres for which they could claim the transport standard-costs. Eligible trips are those where the dominant purpose of the trip was to transport the boarder. At the end of the year, Ashan and Lisa could then calculate their annual transport standard-cost (see “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” for help with this). That amount could then be added to Ashan and Lisa’s total weekly standard-costs for the year and their annual housing standard-costs (see “Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services” for help with calculating these amounts at the end of the year). The total of these three elements would be Ashan and Lisa’s total standard-costs for the year. If Ashan and Lisa’s boarding income was: Less than (or equal to) their They would not have any tax total standard-costs obligations for their boarding income. more than their Their boarding income over the total standard-costs amount of their total standard-costs would be taxable and must be included in their tax returns (split between them). Commentary on DET 19/01 25 UNCLASSIFIED Example D3 – Host rents their home and receives an accommodation supplement Sandra lives alone and has decided to get a boarder to help with her expenses. She is planning to charge about $240 per week in board. She would prefer not to have any tax obligations at the end of the year for the boarding income, so she wants to estimate if her likely standard-costs would cover her boarding income if she set the board at that level. Sandra rents her home for $320 per week. She receives an accommodation supplement of $100 per week. Provided it is just Sandra and the boarder living in the house, and Sandra’s accommodation supplement does not increase, the housing standard-cost that could be used for each week the boarder is there would be $110. This is calculated as follows: • For hosts who rent their home, the housing standard-cost is based on their total rent for the year, minus the total accommodation supplement they received for the year. • Sandra’s total annual rent, at $320 per week, would be $16,640 ($320 × 52). • The total accommodation supplement she would receive for the year, at $100 per week, would be $5,200 ($100 × 52). • Sandra’s expected total rent minus her expected total accommodation supplement for the year would be $11,440 ($16,640 – $5,200). • With Sandra and one boarder living in the house, 1 2 of the $11,440 (or $5,720) would be the annual housing standard-cost Sandra could use if the boarder was there for 52 weeks. • The annual amount of $5,720 can be converted to a weekly amount, by dividing it by 52. • On a weekly basis, the housing amount would therefore be $110. • When this is added to the weekly standard-cost of \*$186, Sandra’s total estimated standard-cost converted to a weekly amount would be $296 per week ($186 + $110). This would mean that Sandra’s proposed boarding charge of $240 per week would be covered by her estimated standard-costs ($296 per week). Provided the circumstances don’t change during the year (in particular, see the three bullet points at para D2), Sandra can be confident she would not have any tax obligations for her boarding income if the board is set at the level she is proposing.

Standard-cost household service for private boarding service providers
======================================================================

This Determination rescinds and replaces Determination 05/03: Standard-cost household service for boarding service providers (DET 05/03) and applies from the start of the 2019-20 income year.  
  
This Determination may be relevant to taxpayers who provide private boarding services in their home, if they have no more than four boarders at any time during the income year.  
  
This Determination sets standard costs that can be treated as expenditure incurred in deriving income from providing the boarding accommodation. For any income year, a taxpayer may choose to use these standard costs instead of their actual expenses, provided the criteria in this Determination are met.  
  
This determination also has a related worksheet: [DET 19/01 WS](/determinations/standard-cost-household-service/boarding-service-providers/det-1901-calculator-worksheet)

**Note: DET 19/01 was updated at 2pm on 2 June 2020 to fix minor errors. Paragraph 7 of the Commentary referred to a “short-stay accommodation service” in two places where it should have referred to a “private boarding service”.**

Tax adjustments for livestock under AIM
=======================================

Determination A10 covers tax adjustments for livestock under the accounting income method - applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment for valuing livestock on hand to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  This determination applies to livestock that is excluded from being trading stock due to the application of section EB 2(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax adjustments: some periodic inventory systems

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  If a person does not use a perpetual inventory system to determine the closing value of livestock and calculate accounting income and expenditure in relation to it for an AIM instalment period, the tax adjustment provided in subclause (3) must be made for the period.
  
5.  For the AIM instalment period, the person must make a tax adjustment to accounting income and expenditure on the basis of the closing value for their livestock determined by a physical stocktake done for the period.
  
7.  A person using national standard costs to value livestock must—  
     
    1.  use the Commissioner’s most recent determination issued under section EC 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to calculate the value of homebred livestock and the value of livestock listed in schedule 18, column 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and
      
    3.  value purchases at cost in terms of section EC 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
9.  A person using the herd scheme and national average market values to value livestock must use the Commissioner’s most recent determination issued under section EC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to calculate the value of livestock.
  
11.  Where the Commissioner has received a valid election from a taxpayer under section EC 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the value of livestock under subclause (5) may reflect the adoption of a herd value ratio for a type of specified livestock subject to the herd scheme.

### Example:

Liam operates a dairy farm and uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate his provisional tax liability.

To value his livestock Liam uses the national standard cost scheme.

For the current income year Liam acquired a perpetual inventory system which provides a continuous record of each stock movement.

In the above circumstances applying clause 3(1) of this determination, Liam may rely on the output of his perpetual inventory system, and on the relevant values under subpart EC of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Liam may also rely on the Commissioner’s determination under section EC 23 of that Act setting national standard costs which was issued for the income year prior to the current income year.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:  
      
    **livestock** means livestock, as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, excluded from being trading stock due to the application of section EB 2(3)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007:  
      
    **perpetual inventory system** means a system which tracks each individual stock movement as it occurs and does not solely rely on periodic stocktakes to determine the closing value of trading stock and calculate accounting income and expenditure in relation to it:  
      
    **trading stock** has the same meaning as in section EB 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
3.  Any word or term that is defined in a Revenue Act and used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in that Act.
  
5.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax rates for AIM
=================

2017 determination considers tax rates for the Accounting Income Method (AIM) and applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the applicable tax rate to apply to year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax rates

1.  For a person, an AIM-capable accounting system must apply the applicable tax rate in subclause (2) or (3) to the person’s net positive accounting income and expenditure year-to-date, after tax adjustments, to calculate their current instalment period payment, as provided by subclause (7).
  
3.  If the person is a company that schedule 1, part A, clause 2 of the Income Tax Act 2017 applies to for the tax year to which the current instalment period relates, the tax rate for the instalment period is the basic rate provided by schedule 1, part A, clause 2 of that Act.
  
5.  If the person is a person that schedule 1, part A, clause 1 applies to for the tax year to which the current instalment period relates, the tax rate for the instalment period is given by the following formula:  
      
    full-year tax ÷ full-year net positive amount.
  
7.  In the formula—  
      
    **full-year tax** is the amount of tax a person would have for the tax year related to the current instalment period from applying table 1 of schedule 1, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the full-year net positive amount:  
      
    **full-year net positive amount** is the amount given by the formula in subclause (6).
  
9.  For the purposes of calculating the full-year net positive amount, the formula is—  
      
    annual instalments x year-to-date net positive amount ÷ instalments year-to-date.
  
11.  In the formula—  
      
    **annual instalments** is the number of instalment periods for the relevant tax year:  
      
    **year-to-date net positive amount** is the net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for instalment periods, including the current instalment period, year-to-date:  
      
    **instalments year-to-date** is the number of instalment periods, including the current instalment period, year-to-date.
  
13.  For the purposes of calculating the current instalment period payment, the formula is—  
      
    year-to-date net positive amount x tax rate - (payments + refunds).
  
15.  In the formula—  
      
    **payments** is the amount of provisional tax paid for the income year, year-to-date:  
      
    **refunds** is the amount of provisional tax refunded for the income year, year-to-date:  
      
    **tax rate** is the tax rate provided by subclause (2) or (3):  
      
    **year-to-date net positive amount** is the net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for instalment periods, including the current instalment period, year-to-date.

### Example

Emma is a sole trader who uses AIM to calculate her provisional tax liability. She pays provisional tax in 6 instalments during the year.

Emma is in her 3rd instalment period, August/September 2018.

For the AIM instalment periods April/May 2018, June/July and August/September 2018 Emma has the following net positive accounting income (after accounting expenditure and tax adjustments):

| AIM Instalment Period | Net positive accounting income ($) |
| --- | --- |
| April/May 2018 | 5,000 |
| June/July 2018 | 7,510 |
| August/September 2018 | 14,250 |
| **Total** | **26,760** |

At the end of the June/July period, Emma has made AIM payments totalling $2,500.

The full-year net positive amount for the purposes of clause 3(4) of this determination is calculated using the formula in clause 3(5)—

annual instalments x year-to-date net positive amount ÷ instalments year-to-date.

For Emma, the full-year net positive amount is—

6 x 26,760 ÷ 3 = 53,520

Having calculated the full-year net positive amount the full-year tax can be calculated. For Emma the full-year tax is—

| Income tax rate | Income | Tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income up to $14,000, taxed at 10.5% | $14,000 | $1,470 |
| Income over $14,001 and up to $48,000, taxed at 17.5% | $34,000 | $5,950 |
| Income over $48,001 and up to $70,000, taxed at 30% | $5,520 | $1,656 |
| Remaining income $70,001 onwards, taxed at 33% | $0  | $0  |
| **Total** | **$53,520** | **$9,076** |

The full year-tax for Emma therefore is $9,076.

The tax rate applicable to the net positive accounting income for the instalment period is calculated using the formula in clause 3(3)—

full-year tax ÷ full-year net positive amount.

The tax rate for Emma therefore is calculated in the following way—

9,076 ÷ 53,520 = 16.9581%

Emma’s tax rate therefore is 16.96% for the current instalment period.

Emma applies this rate, on a year-to-date basis, to calculate her payment due for the current August/September 2018, using the formula in clause 3(7)—

year-to-date net positive amount × tax rate

26,760 × 0.1696 = 4,538

Emma has paid $2,500 year to date and received no refunds year to date, so her payment for August/September 2018 is—

4,538 - (2,500 + 0) = 2,039

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this notice, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date.
2.  Any word or term that is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 and used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in those Acts.
3.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax adjustments for private expenditure under AIM
=================================================

Determination A4 (10 Oct 2017) relates to tax adjustments for private expenditure under the Accounting Income Method for calculating provisional tax.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (AIM), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment for private expenditure to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  The private limitation is set out in section DA 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and provides that a person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature.
  
7.  If accounting expenditure includes an amount of private expenditure, a tax adjustment is necessary to exclude that expenditure.

### Application

1.  This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.
  
3.  This determination does not make tax adjustments relating to entertainment expenditure to which section DD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies.

### Tax adjustments: private expenditure not included

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  For a person, for an instalment period, accounting expenditure must not include an amount of private expenditure.

### Example 1:

Kelvin uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate his provisional tax liability.

From his logbook, Kelvin knows that 17% of his travel in his motor vehicle is private travel. Kelvin applies this percentage to the cost code for motor vehicle expenses in his accounting software.

An AIM-capable accounting system will exclude 17% of Kelvin’s motor vehicle expenses because 17% of this expenditure is private in nature.

### Example 2:

Jennifer uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate her provisional tax liability.

During the instalment period April/May, Jennifer paid for her children’s school trip from her business’s bank account. Jennifer has excluded the costs of the school trip from accounting expenditure by recording these costs against her shareholder current account.

For the April/May instalment period, a tax adjustment is not required to accounting expenditure to exclude the cost of the school trip.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:  
      
    **private expenditure**, for a person, is the expenditure for which the person is denied a deduction under section DA 2(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
3.  Any word or term that is defined in a Revenue Act and used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in that Act.
  
5.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax adjustments for accounts receivable and accounts payable under AIM
======================================================================

Determination A6 (Oct 2017) - Tax adjustments for accounts receivable and accounts payable under the Accounting income method (AIM) for paying provisional tax.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment for accounts receivable and payable to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  Where a person is registered for GST on a payments basis or is not registered for GST, they are not required to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure. They may however elect to accrue accounts receivable and accounts payable in calculating accounting income and expenditure, and, where an election is made, that election cannot be revoked for the income year.
  
7.  A person that is registered for GST on an invoice basis must account on an accrual basis.
  
9.  A person that is registered for GST on a hybrid basis may account on a hybrid basis or on an accrual basis.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax adjustments: choices and adjustments

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  Subclauses (3), (4), and (5) apply to adjust accounting income and expenditure, if such income and expenditure is assessable or deductible.
  
5.  A person who is not registered for GST or is a registered person who must account for GST on a payments basis must account for accounting income and expenditure on a money received and paid basis for an income year, unless they make an election to account on an accounts receivable and accounts payable basis (**accrual accounting basis**) for an income year. For instalment periods in the income year, tax adjustments to accounting income and expenditure must be made to account for their elected basis.
  
7.  A registered person who must account for GST on an invoice basis for an instalment period must use the accrual accounting basis using tax invoices, debit notes, and credit notes, received and issued as the basis for accounts receivable and payable (**registered accrual accounting basis**). For the instalment period, tax adjustments to accounting income and expenditure must be made to account for the registered accrual accounting basis.
  
9.  A registered person who must account for GST on a hybrid basis must choose, for an income year, to account for accounting income and expenditure on either an accrual accounting basis or on a money paid and accounts receivable basis. For an instalment period in the income year, tax adjustments to accounting income and expenditure must be made to account for their basis.

### Example:

Trish uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate her provisional tax liability and is registered for GST on the invoice basis.

For her AIM instalment period August/September Trish had invoiced sales (excluding GST) of $12,000.

Of her total invoiced sales during the AIM-instalment period she received payments of $7,520.

Trish has accounts payable during the AIM-instalment period (excluding GST) of $8,000. Of that, Trish paid $6,750 during the AIM-instalment period.

An AIM-capable accounting system must ensure that accounting income for sales is $12,000 making an adjustment of $5,461 to income on top of her cash accounting basis position ($6,539).

Similarly her accounting expenditure is $8,000 not $6,750.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:
  
3.  Any word used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Tax Administration Act 1994 (as appropriate), unless the context otherwise requires.
  
5.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax adjustments for losses under AIM
====================================

Determination A7 (10 Oct 2017) covers tax adjustments for losses under the Accounting Income Method (AIM).

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment for losses to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  A taxpayer is allowed an increase in accounting expenditure on account of a loss balance carried forward under section IA 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007. A loss balance carried forward becomes available when the previous tax year’s assessment has been made.
  
7.  Grouping of tax losses by companies is not permitted in AIM.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax adjustments: previous assessed year

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  For a person, for the instalment in the current income year in which the date of assessment for the previous tax year falls, the previous tax year’s assessed loss is allowed as a tax adjustment to increase accounting expenditure in that instalment period.

### Example:

Graeme assesses a loss balance for the 2020-21 tax year of $1m, to be carried forward to the 2021-22 tax year. His assessment is dated 20 December 2021. It occurs part way through the 3rd of 6 instalment periods for his 2021-22 income year.

Graeme has $1m expenditure in his 3rd instalment for his 2021-22 income year.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:  
      
    **previous tax year’s assessed loss** is the loss balance carried forward to the tax year corresponding to the current income year from the previous tax year.
  
3.  Any word or term that is defined in a Revenue Act and used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in that Act.
  
5.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax adjustments for depreciation loss and depreciation recovery income under AIM
================================================================================

Determination A8 covers tax adjustments for depreciation loss and depreciation recovery income under the Accounting Income Method. Applies 2018-19 onwards.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment for depreciation loss and depreciation recovery income to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  It provides that, for tax adjustment purposes, accounting income and expenditure must not include any depreciation- or amortisation-related amounts unless a person chooses to use the relevant provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
7.  Subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007 quantifies the amount of depreciation recovery income that is income under Part C of the Income Tax Act 2007 and quantifies the amount of depreciation loss a person is allowed as a deduction where the provisions of Part D of the Income Tax Act 2007 are satisfied.
  
9.  Where a person chooses to use tax depreciation, this determination provides an appropriate tax adjustment, consistent with subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007, for—  
     
    1.  accounting income, commensurate with the amount of depreciation recovery income arising under Part C of the Income Tax Act 2007:
      
    3.  accounting expenditure, commensurate with the amount of depreciation loss arising under Part D of the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
11.  If a person chooses to not use tax depreciation, this determination provides a tax adjustment such that accounting income and expenditure does not include any depreciation- or amortisation-related amounts.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax adjustments: no depreciation or choose tax depreciation

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  A person must choose, for an income year, to either—  
     
    1.  not account for any depreciation- or amortisation-related income and expenditure in relation to any of their depreciable property; or
      
    3.  account for depreciation- and amortisation-related income and expenditure in relation to all of their depreciable property using, for each instalment period in the income year, the amounts of depreciation recovery income and depreciation loss calculated, for the relevant period, under the Income Tax Act 2007.
  
5.  If a person uses the choice in subclause (2)(b), the amount of depreciation loss is limited to the amount calculated on a year-to-date basis.
  
7.  For an instalment period in the income year, tax adjustments to accounting income and expenditure must be made to account for their choice.

### Example 1:

Sharon uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate her provisional tax.

The accounting software which Sharon uses calculates depreciation recovery income and depreciation loss consistent with subpart EE of the Income Tax Act 2007.

For the AIM instalment period December/January 2019, Sharon’s accounting software has calculated a depreciation loss of $2,000 for the 2 months year-to-date.

In these circumstances clause 3 of this determination will allow the depreciation loss of $2,000 as accounting expenditure in the December/January 2019 AIM-instalment period.

### Example 2:

Keith uses an AIM-capable accounting system to calculate his provisional tax.

He chooses to account for depreciation and amortisation related income and expenditure under clause 3(2)(b).

He has one asset in his business. The opening tax book value of the asset in his AIM-capable software at the beginning of the year is $3,200 and he uses the diminishing value method of depreciation.

The diminishing value rate of depreciation for the asset is 50%. Under clause 3(3), Keith is only permitted a deduction for the depreciation calculation year-to-date. His current AIM instalment period is his second 2-month period for the income year. Thus, the year-to-date amount is for 4 months.

Keith’s software automatically calculates the depreciation charge for the year (being 50% of $3,200) as $1,600 and apportions that charge for the 4 months year-to-date.

Keith has expenditure of $533.33 for depreciation for the year-to-date. This automatically feeds into his accounting income and expenditure from his fixed asset register so no separate tax adjustment is required.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:  
     
2.  Any word or term that is defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 and used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in those Acts.
  
4.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

Tax adjustments for provisions under AIM
========================================

Determination A9 (10 Oct 2017) relates to tax adjustments for provisions under the Accounting Income Method for calculating provisional tax.

### Scope

1.  Under the Accounting Income Method (**AIM**), taxpayers can calculate their provisional tax payments by using accounting software if that software is in accordance with determinations made under section 91AAX of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
  
3.  An AIM-capable accounting system calculates provisional tax using year-to-date accounting income and expenditure adjusted for tax purposes (if required). The purpose of this determination is to detail the tax adjustment to provisions to calculate year-to-date net positive accounting income and expenditure, after tax adjustments, for an AIM instalment period.
  
5.  A provision, as a general principle, will not meet the test of being incurred and therefore will not be deductible for tax purposes.
  
7.  Where accounting expenditure includes a provision, a tax adjustment is necessary to exclude that expenditure.
  
9.  However a provision is permitted if it relates to expenditure on employment income for a shareholder of a company. A deduction for accounting expenditure is limited to the extent to which the company pays tax as an agent of the shareholder in relation to the provision for shareholder employment income.

### Application

This determination applies for the 2018-19 and later income years.

### Tax adjustments: choices and adjustments

1.  This clause requires tax adjustments to the extent to which a person’s accounting income and expenditure does not already accord with the adjustments described in this clause.
  
3.  For a person, for an instalment period, accounting expenditure must not include an amount on account of a provision.
  
5.  Despite subclause (2), an instalment period’s accounting expenditure may include an amount on account of a provision to the extent to which the person is a company and the provision relates to expenditure on employment income for a shareholder-employee of the company. The amount of the provision allowed as an adjustment to increase accounting expenditure for the instalment period is the lesser of—  
     
    1.  the provision; and
      
    3.  the amount of tax paid during the instalment period as agent for the shareholder-employee divided by the rate given by subclause (4).
  
7.  The tax rate for the purposes of subclause (3)(b) is given by the following formula—  
      
    full year tax ÷ full-year income.
  
9.  In the formula—  
      
    **full-year tax** is the amount of tax the shareholder-employee would have for the tax year related to the current instalment period from applying table 1 of schedule 1, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the full-year income:  
      
    **full-year income** is the amount given by the formula in subclause (6).
  
11.  For the purposes of calculating the full-year income, the formula is—  
      
    annual instalments × year-to-date net positive amount ÷ instalments year-to-date.
  
13.  In the formula—  
      
    **annual instalments** is the number of instalment periods for the company for the relevant tax year:  
      
    **year-to-date net positive amount** is the total amount of provisions allowed under this determination for the shareholder-employee for instalment periods, including the current instalment period, year-to-date:  
      
    **instalments year-to-date** is the number of instalment periods, including the current instalment period, year-to-date.

### Example:

Oliver’s Apples Limited (OAL) uses AIM to calculate its provisional tax payments which it pays in 6 instalments during the year.

OAL has 2 shareholder’s Oliver and Emily.

For the first AIM-instalment period April/May 2018-19, OAL has net accounting income before shareholder remuneration of $20,000.

It is intended that for the AIM-instalment period April/May 2018-19 OAL will make provisions for shareholder remuneration of $11,500 for Oliver and $8,500 for Emily that form part of the accounting expenditure for the instalment period. It is also intended that the tax liability relating to both shareholders’ remuneration will be paid by OAL as agent for each shareholder.

A person’s full-year income amount is calculated using the formula in clause 3(6).

For Oliver the full-year income is—  
  
6 x 11,500 ÷ 1 = 69,000

For Emily the full-year income is—  
  
6 x 8,500 ÷ 1 = 51,000

The full-year tax in clause 3(5) of this determination is calculated by applying table 1 of schedule 1, part A of the Income Tax Act 2007 to the full-year income amount.

For Oliver the full-year tax amount is—

| Income tax rate | Income | Tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income up to $14,000, taxed at 10.5% | $14,000 | $1,470 |
| Income over $14,001 and up to $48,000, taxed at 17.5% | $34,000 | $5,950 |
| Income over $48,001 and up to $70,000, taxed at 30% | $21,000 | $6,300 |
| Remaining income $70,001 onwards, taxed at 33% | $0  | $0  |
| **Total** | **$69,000** | **$13,720** |

Based on a full-year tax amount for Oliver of $13,720 OAL makes a decision to make a payment as agent for Oliver of $2,286.67 ($13,720 ÷ 6 = $2,286.67).

For Emily the full-year tax amount is—

| Income tax rate | Income | Tax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income up to $14,000, taxed at 10.5% | $14,000 | $1,470 |
| Income over $14,001 and up to $48,000, taxed at 17.5% | $34,000 | $5,950 |
| Income over $48,001 and up to $70,000, taxed at 30% | $3,000 | $900 |
| Remaining income $70,001 onwards, taxed at 33% | $0  | $0  |
| **Total** | **$51,000** | **$8,320** |

Based on a full-year tax amount for Emily of $8,320, OAL makes a decision to make a payment as agent for Emily of $1,386.67 ($8,320 ÷ 6 = $1,386.67).

Having calculated the full-year tax and full-year income for each shareholder the tax rate for the purposes of clause 3(3)(b) of this determination can be calculated.

The formula in clause 3(4) provides that the tax rate is calculated by dividing a person’s full-year tax by their full-year income.

For Oliver the rate for the current instalment period is calculated in the following way:  
  
13, 720 ÷ 69,000 = 0.198841.

For Emily the rate for the current instalment period is calculated in the following way:  
  
8,320 ÷ 51,000 = 0.163137.

Under clause 3(3), OAL’s accounting expenditure for the current instalment period is increased by the lesser of—

1.  the provision, and
  
3.  the amount of tax paid during the instalment period as agent for the shareholder-employee divided by the rate given by clause 3(4).

The amount of tax paid during the April/May AIM-instalment period for Oliver is $2,286.67 and for Emily is $1,386.67. The tax OAL pays as agent for Oliver and Emily will result in an increase to OAL’s accounting expenditure of $11,500 ($2,286.67 ÷ 0.198841 = $11,500) and $8,500 ($1,386.67 ÷ 0.163137 = $8,500).

Oliver’s personal residual income tax under the Income Tax Act 2007 is reduced by $2,286.67.

Emily’s personal residual income tax is reduced by $1,386.67.

The reductions in residual income tax arise under the agency arrangement between OAL, and Oliver and Emily, in accordance with paragraph (a) of the definition **residual income tax** in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Tax adjustments: manual and automatic

A tax adjustment under this determination must be made by—

1.  the user of the accounting software, manually:
2.  the accounting software, automatically:
3.  any other means, as appropriate.

### Tax adjustments: errors and oversights in previous instalment period

An error or oversight affecting accounting income or expenditure (including income or expenditure adjusted by a determination) for an instalment period in an income year must be corrected by making a tax adjustment in the next instalment period after the one in which the error or oversight is identified.

### Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,—  
      
    **instalment period**, for a person, means the 2-monthly or monthly period given by schedule 3, part AB of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the applicable instalment date:  
      
    **provision** means an amount of accounting expenditure provided to meet expenditure not yet incurred.
  
3.  Any word used, but not defined, in this determination has the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Tax Administration Act 1994 (as appropriate), unless the context otherwise requires.
  
5.  Examples used in this determination are included in this determination only as interpretational aids. If there is conflict between an interpretational aid and a provision of this determination, the provision prevails.

This determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed on the 10th day of October 2017.

### Commentary on determination

This commentary does not form part of the determination. It is intended to provide assistance in the understanding and application of the determination.

Section 91AAS of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the Commissioner the power to issue a determination declaring an event as an emergency event for the purposes of section MB 13(2)(r)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

In setting this determination, the Commissioner must set a period relating to the event for the purposes of section MB 13(2)(r)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 up to a maximum period of 12 months from the date of the event.

Section MB 13(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 took effect from 1 April 2011 and includes in the family scheme income (which is used in the calculation of a person's Working for Families Tax Credit entitlement) of a person the value of payments paid to the person used to replace lost or diminished income or used to meet usual living expenses.

Section MB 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 excludes certain payments from being included in family scheme income under section MB 13(1). Section MB 13(2)(r) excludes from family scheme income a payment made to relieve the adverse effects of an event declared an emergency event by the Commissioner by way of determination under section 91AAS of the Tax Administration Act 1994 where the payment is made in the time period set by the Commissioner in the determination.

This determination declares the earthquake that occurred in Canterbury on 4 September 2010 as an emergency event and sets a 12 month time period for the purposes of section MB 13(2)(r) from 4 September 2010 to 3 September 2011.

Section MB 13(2)(r) came into force 1 April 2011 which is the day section MB 13(1) came into force. Therefore a payment made between 1 April 2011 and 3 September 2011 (inclusive of both dates) to relieve the adverse effects of the Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 will not be included in a person's family scheme income under section MB 13(1).

Debt securities, finance leases and hire purchase agreements denominated in New Zealand dollars (CANCELLED)
===========================================================================================================

Determination G30 (30 Mar 2006) allows financial institutions that adopt IFRS to mostly continue the same methods of calculating income and expenditure.

This determination has been cancelled. See [Cancellation of Determination G30](/determinations/financial-arrangements/general/cancellation-of-determination-g30)
.

Determination G30 allows financial institutions that adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to continue to use the same methods of calculating income and expenditure for most financial arrangements as under the previous rules – in particular, where income and expenditure from those financial arrangements were returned under the alternative method to yield to maturity.

The new Determination can apply where IFRS is used for financial reporting by persons in the business of lending money and to the holders of finance leases and hire purchase agreements. However, it does not apply to debt securities that are held or issued for dealing or liquidity purposes.

Where the new Determination applies, the pre-IFRS tax treatment of interest and principle payments can continue. Generally, that treatment was an alternative to the yield to maturity method under section EW 16 of the Income Tax Act 2004. However, a condition of adopting an alternative method was that the same method be used for both tax and financial accounting purposes. Following the adoption of IFRS, section EW 16 no longer sanctions use of the alternative method because the tax method would not be used by the taxpayer for financial accounting purposes. Determination G30 reinstates the status quo for interest and principle payments.

However, fee income and fee expenditure are recognised under the determination for tax purposes in the same manner as they are recognised under IFRS. Tax adjustments for impairment are not allowed.

The determination is intended to be a temporary measure to provide certainty of tax treatment while a legislative response to the introduction of IFRS is being developed.

The new Determination was published in the New Zealand Gazette on Thursday 30 March 2006 and may be applied to existing financial arrangements at that date and to new financial arrangements subsequently acquired.

Issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by BNZIS, and related transactions
===========================================================================

This determination covers an arrangement involving the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by BNZ Income Securities Limited to the public and to National Equities Limited. The arrangement is fully described in product ruling BR Prd 09/02.

This determination may be cited as "Determination S14: Issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by BNZIS, and related transactions".

### 1\. Explanation

(which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement involving the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares (the "BNZIS Shares") by BNZ Income Securities Ltd ("BNZIS") to the public and National Equities Limited ("NEL") pursuant to an Investment Statement dated 25 February 2008. That arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 09/03 and product ruling BR Prd 09/02, issued on 5 February 2009, and is fully described in those rulings.
2.  The BNZIS Shares are excepted financial arrangements. The BNZIS Shares form part of a wider financial arrangement including the investment by BNZIS of the proceeds of issue of the BNZIS Shares by way of a loan (the "BNZIM Loan") to BNZ Income Management Ltd ("BNZIM"), and the use of the BNZIM Loan proceeds by BNZIM to subscribe for perpetual preference shares issued by BNZ (the "BNZ Preference Shares"). The BNZIS Shares are also subject to a call option ("Call Option") held by National Australia Bank Ltd ("NAB"). BNZIS has entered into a Deed Poll ("Deed Poll") in favour of the BNZIS Shareholders, which applies if the dividends on the BNZIS Shares are not fully imputed and this results in a loss to a BNZIS Shareholder.
3.  This wider financial arrangement has "excepted financial arrangement" components as defined in section EW 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The excepted financial arrangements are:
    *   the BNZIS Shares
    *   the BNZ Preference Shares, and
    *   the Call Option.  
        
4.  The amount of gross income deemed to be derived, or expenditure deemed to be incurred, by a person under the financial arrangement rules in respect of a financial arrangement excludes any amount of income, gain or loss, or expenditure that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangements.
5.  This determination prescribes a method to be used for determining the part of the consideration receivable by the parties to the arrangement that is attributable to the excepted financial arrangements.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made pursuant to section 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of Determination

1.  This determination applies specifically to:
    *   the BNZIS Shares
    *   the BNZ Preference Shares, and
    *   the Call Option.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The BNZIS Shares, the BNZ Preference Shares, the Call Option and the BNZIM Loan are each part of a wider financial arrangement which has "excepted financial arrangement" components as defined in section EW 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The excepted financial arrangements are:
    *   the BNZIS Shares
    *   the BNZ Preference Shares, and
    *   the Call Option.
2.  Any income, gain or loss, or expenditure that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not included when calculating gross income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules.
3.  This determination specifies that the amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangements are the amounts paid under or with respect to the BNZIS Shares, the BNZ Preference Shares and the Call Option.
4.  This determination specifies that no part of (inter alia) the amount advanced or repaid under the BNZIM Loan, or the interest paid on the BNZIM Loan, is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the BNZIS Shares are:
    *   the issue price per BNZIS Share of $1
    *   the dividends paid on the BNZIS Shares by BNZIS
    *   any amount paid by BNZIS under the Deed Poll where BNZIS has not fully imputed the dividends on the BNZIS Shares
    *   any other distributions paid on or with respect to the BNZIS Shares by BNZIS, and
    *   any amounts paid to acquire the BNZIS Shares, whether pursuant to the Call Option or otherwise.
2.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the BNZ Preference Shares are:
    *   the issue price per BNZ Preference Share of $1
    *   the dividends paid on the BNZ Preference Shares by BNZ
    *   any other distributions paid on or with respect to the BNZ Preference Shares by BNZ, and
    *   any amounts paid to acquire the BNZ Preference Shares.
3.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Call Option are:
    *   the amount paid to acquire the BNZIS Shares under the Call Option, and
    *   the value of the BNZIS Shares transferred to a person nominated by NAB pursuant to the Call Option.

### 7\. Example

BNZIS raised $449,730,000 from the issue of the BNZIS Shares on 28 March 2008, and lent the same amount to BNZIM, at an interest rate of 9.89% per annum, payable quarterly on 28 March, June, September and December. Therefore, the amount of interest on the BNZIM Loan for each full quarter is $11,119,574.

BNZIM used the funds to invest in BNZ Preference Shares.

The BNZIS Shares have traded on the NZDX at prices of from $1 to $1.10.

The amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement are:

*   the issue price of the BNZIS Shares
*   the dividend paid on the BNZIS Shares
*   the consideration paid for the purchase of BNZIS Shares on the NZDX
*   the issue price of the BNZ Preference Shares, and
*   the dividend paid on the BNZ Preference Shares.

The amounts not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement are:

*   the amount of the BNZIM Loan ($449,730,000)
*   the interest paid on the BNZIM Loan ($11,119,574 per quarter)
*   the amount paid by BNZIM to BNZIS under the BNZIM Loan as reimbursement for expenses incurred by BNZIS (provided that such expenses are not "non-integral fees", as defined in section YA 1), and
*   the amount to be repaid on the repayment of the BNZIM Loan.

This determination is signed by me on the 5th day of February 2009.

Financial arrangement income or expenditure from certain retirement village arrangement
=======================================================================================

Determination S16 relates to an Occupation Right Agreement or financial arrangement between the operator and a resident of a retirement village.

This Determination may be cited as Determination S16: _Financial arrangement income or expenditure from certain retirement village arrangement_.

### 1\. Explanation (note that the explanation does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to an Occupation Right Agreement between the Operator and the Resident.
2.  The Occupation Right Agreement constitutes a financial arrangement in which the Resident provides money to the Operator. For the duration of the Occupation Right Agreement, the Operator provides the Resident with accommodation and associated services. On finding a new Resident to live in the villa that the original Resident exited, the Operator pays the original Resident the Termination Payment.
3.  As a lease is an excepted financial arrangement under section EW 5(9) of the Income Tax Act 2007, only the Initial Fee and Termination Payment are regarded as amounts for the purposes of calculating aggregate income or expenditure. Any income or expenditure solely attributable to the lease is disregarded.
4.  Under section EW 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the amount of the gross income deemed to be derived or the expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a financial arrangement under the Financial Arrangements Rules shall not include any amounts that are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement that is part of the financial arrangement.
5.  This Determination prescribes the method to be used when calculating for Financial Arrangements Rules purposes the aggregate income derived or aggregate expenditure incurred in respect of the Occupation Right Agreement for both the Operator and the Resident. It details which amounts are to be included for this calculation and which amounts are attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.
6.  This Determination does not consider the spreading of income or expenditure under the Financial Arrangements Rules in relation to the Occupation Right Agreement. In this regard, see subpart EW of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This Determination is made under section 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies only to the Occupation Right Agreement described as follows:  
    The Operator and Resident enter into the Occupation Right Agreement. The Resident pays the Operator the Initial Fee. The Termination Payment (which is equal to the Initial Fee) is paid to the Resident or the Resident's estate on termination of the Occupation Right Agreement.  
    The Resident pays the Accommodation Payment to the Operator. The Accommodation Payment accrues daily. The Accommodation Payment each year is equal to 7 percent of the Initial Fee. The Accommodation Payment can only ever accrue to 35 percent of the Initial Fee. The Accommodation Payment is offset against the Termination Payment at the termination of the Occupation Right Agreement.  
    The Village Expenses Payment is a yearly amount the Resident pays in monthly instalments to the Operator. This payment covers costs, expenses, and fees associated with the operation of the Village, such as wages, taxes, rates, levies, water, gas, electricity, and maintenance.  
    The Operator provides accommodation and associated services to the Resident.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Occupation Right Agreement has both financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement components.
2.  When calculating income or expenditure in relation to the Occupation Right Agreement it is first necessary to separate the two components (financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement) of the Occupation Right Agreement.
3.  This Determination specifies that the:
    *   Initial Fee and Termination Payments relate to the financial arrangement component; and
    *   Accommodation Payment and Village Expenses Payments relate to the lease component of the Occupation Right Agreement, which is an excepted financial arrangement and will be excluded from the application of the Financial Arrangements Rules when calculating income or expenditure for the Operator.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this Determination, the following expressions (which have not been defined elsewhere within the Determination) have the following meanings:  
      
    **Initial Fee** means the lump sum payable by the Resident to the Operator on entering into the Occupation Right Agreement.  
      
    **Termination Payment** means the lump sum payable by the Operator to the Resident on termination of the Occupation Right Agreement and the signing of a new Occupation Right Agreement with a new Resident who will occupy the villa that the departing Resident previously occupied.  
      
    **Operator** means operator of the Retirement Village. Resident means a resident of the Retirement Village.  
      
    **Accommodation Payment** means the amount payable in consideration for the supply of accommodation to the Resident. The Accommodation Payment accrues daily, up to a maximum of 35 percent of the Termination Payment, at 7 percent per year.  
      
    **Village Expenses Payment** means the amount payable in consideration for the supply of accommodation to the Resident. It includes all costs, charges, expenses, wages, salaries, fees, and other outgoings paid or payable in relation to the management, supervision, and operation of the Village.

### 6\. Method

1.  In respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and any other consideration receivable by the Operator or payable by the Resident, the amounts not to be taken into account to calculate income or expenditure are the:
    1.  Accommodation Payment; and
    2.  Village Expenses Payment.
2.  In respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and any other consideration receivable by the Operator or payable by the Resident, the amounts to be taken into account to calculate income or expenditure are the:
    1.  Initial Fee; and
    2.  Termination Payment.

### 7\. Examples

**Example A**

1.  Example A illustrates the application of the method (set out in the Determination) for determining the amounts attributable to both the financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement components of the Occupation Right Agreement between the Resident and the Operator.
2.  Example A assumes the:
    1.  Resident occupies a unit from 19 August 2009 until 31 March 2012;
    2.  Initial Fee and Termination Payment are $300,000 each;
    3.  Accommodation Payment is an amount equal to 7 percent of the Initial Fee per year, accruing to a maximum of 35 percent of the Initial Fee; and
    4.  Village Expenses Payment is $1,200 per year payable in equal monthly instalments.
3.  On 5 August 2009, a Resident enters into an Occupation Right Agreement with the Operator. The Resident pays a deposit of $5,000 of the Initial Fee. The balance of $295,000 of the Initial Fee is paid to the Operator on the commencement date of the Occupation Right Agreement, 19 August 2009.
4.  The Resident leaves the Village on 13 March 2012, and the Occupation Right Agreement terminates on that date. The Operator locates a replacement Resident on 10 June 2012 and pays the Resident the Termination Payment of $300,000 on that date.
5.  The two amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement are as follows.
    1.  The Accommodation Payment accrues daily from 19 August 2009 until 13 March 2012 at 7 percent per year of the Initial Fee. There are two years from 19 August 2009 to 18 August 2011, and 206 days from 19 August 2011 to 13 March 2012. This is equal to 2.564 years. Therefore, the Accommodation Payment is equal to 17.948 percent (7 percent per year for 2.564 years) of $300,000: Accommodation Payment = $53,844.
    2.  The Village Outgoing Payment is a yearly charge of $1,200 payable in equal monthly instalments of $100. The Resident pays each instalment monthly from 19 August 2009 until 13 March 2012, for a total of 31 months. The total Village Outgoing Payment equals 31 times $100: Village Outgoing Payment = $3,100.
6.  The aggregate amount attributable to the financial arrangement component of the Occupation Right Agreement, and therefore to be taken into account under the Financial Arrangements Rules, is $0 ($300,000 less $300,000), comprising the Initial Fee and Termination Payment. This amount constitutes aggregate income/expenditure under the Financial Arrangements Rules. All other amounts payable under the Occupation Right Agreement relate to the excepted financial arrangement component of the Occupation Right Agreement, so should not be taken into account when calculating income or expenditure.
7.  Note that example A deals only with the amounts attributable to the excepted financial arrangement and financial arrangement components of the Occupation Right Agreement. Example A does not deal with the attribution or spreading, under the Financial Arrangements Rules, of income or expenditure to particular income years. However, there is no aggregate income or expenditure in any income years.

**Example B**

8.  Example B illustrates the application of the method (set out in the Special Determination) for determining the amounts attributable to both the financial arrangement and excepted financial arrangement components of the Occupation Right Agreement between the Resident and the Operator.
9.  Example B assumes the:
    1.  Resident occupies a unit from 24 January 2010 until 14 August 2018;
    2.  Initial Fee and Termination Payment are $300,000 each;
    3.  Accommodation Payment is an amount equal to 7 percent of the Initial Fee per year, accruing to a maximum of 35 percent of the Initial Fee;
    4.  Village Expenses Payment is $1,200 per year payable in equal monthly instalments;
    5.  Termination Payment is not paid until 2 August 2019.

10.  On 3 January 2010, a Resident enters into an Occupation Right Agreement with the Operator. The Resident pays a deposit of $5,000 of the Initial Fee. The Resident pays the balance of the Initial Fee ($295,000) to the Operator on the commencement date of the Occupation Right Agreement, 24 January 2010.
11.  The Resident leaves the Village on 14 August 2018, and the Occupation Right Agreement terminates on that date. The Operator locates a replacement Resident on 24 October 2018 and pays the Resident the Termination Payment of $300,000 on that date.
12.  The amounts solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement are as follows.
    1.  The Accommodation Payment accrues daily from 24 January 2010 until 14 August 2018 at 7 percent per year of the Initial Fee, to a maximum of 35 percent of the Initial Fee. There are eight years from 24 January 2010 to 23 January 2018, and 202 days from 24 January 2018 to 14 August 2018. This is equal to 8.553 years. Therefore, the Accommodation Payment is equal to 35 percent (7 percent per year until a maximum of 35 percent) of $300,000:  
        Accommodation Payment = $105,000.
    2.  The Village Outgoing Payment is a yearly charge of $1,200, payable in equal monthly instalments of $100. The Resident pays $100 monthly from 24 January 2010 until 14 August 2018, a total of 103 months. The total Village Outgoing Payments equals 103 times $100:  
        Village Outgoing Payment = $10,300.
13.  The aggregate amount attributable to the financial arrangement component of the Occupation Right Agreement, and therefore to be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules is $0 ($300,000 less $300,000), comprising the Initial Fee and Termination Payment. This amount constitutes aggregate income/expenditure under the Financial Arrangements Rules. All other amounts payable under the Occupation Right Agreement relate to the excepted financial arrangement component of the Occupation Right Agreement, so should not be taken into account when calculating income or expenditure. (14) Note that example B deals with the amounts attributable only to the excepted financial arrangement and financial arrangement components of the Occupation Right Agreement.
14.  Note that example B deals with the amounts attributable only to the excepted financial arrangement and financial arrangement components of the Occupation Right Agreement. Example B does not deal with the attribution or spreading, under the Financial Arrangements Rules, of income or expenditure to particular income years. However, there is no aggregate income or expenditure in any income years.

This Determination is signed by me on the 6th day of June 2010.

Issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by NZ Co, and related transactions
===========================================================================

Determination S18 (17 Mar 2011) relates to an arrangement involving the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by a NZ company to its parent company.

This determination may be cited as "Determination S18: Issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares by NZ Co, and related transactions".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement involving the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares (the PPS) by a New Zealand company (NZ Co) to its parent company (Parent Co). That arrangement is the subject of private ruling BRPrv11/10 issued on 17 March 2011, and is fully described in that ruling.
2.  The PPS are an excepted financial arrangement. The PPS form part of a financial arrangement as contemplated by sEW6(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the wider financial arrangement). The wider financial arrangement also includes a loan from a related party to Parent Co (the Parent Loan), the use of the Parent Loan proceeds by Parent Co to subscribe for the PPS, and the use of dividends received on the PPS, plus payments Parent Co is to receive in terms of the letter dated 23 December 2009 issued by NZ Co to Parent Co (the NZ Co Letter), to pay interest on the Parent Co Loan.
3.  This wider financial arrangement has excepted financial arrangement components, as defined in s EW 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The PPS are an excepted financial arrangement component of the wider financial arrangement.
4.  The amount of income derived or expenditure incurred by a person under the financial arrangement rules in respect of a financial arrangement excludes any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) of the Income Tax Act 2007.
5.  This determination prescribes a method to be used for determining the part of the consideration payable and receivable by the parties to the wider financial arrangement that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies specifically to the PPS.
2.  This determination applies if the interest paid on the Parent Co Loan is at an arm's length market rate.

### 4\. Principles

1.  The PPS, the Parent Co Loan, and the payment and other obligations under the NZ Co Letter are each part of a wider "financial arrangement" that has excepted financial arrangement components as defined in s EW5 of the Income Tax Act 2007.
2.  Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is not included when calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  This determination specifies that the only amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement within the wider financial arrangement are the amounts paid under or with respect to the PPS.
4.  This determination specifies that no part of (inter alia) the amount advanced or repaid under the Parent Co Loan, the interest paid on the Parent Co Loan, or the payments or other consideration provided in terms of the NZ Co Letter, is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.

### 6\. Method

*   The amounts that are solely attributable to the PPS are:
*   the issue price of the PPS;
*   the dividends paid on the PPS;
*   any other distributions paid on or with respect to the PPS by NZ Co; and
*   any amounts paid to acquire the PPS.

### 7\. Example

NZ Co raised $20,000,000 from the issue of the PPS to Parent Co on 29 December 2009. Parent Co funded its acquisition by a loan of the same amount from a related party, at an interest rate of 9.25% per annum, payable quarterly on 28 March, June, September and December each calendar year. Therefore the amount of interest on the Parent Co Loan for each full quarter is $462,500.

The amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement are:

*   the issue price of the PPS; and
*   the dividends paid on the PPS.

The amounts not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement are:

*   the amount of the Parent Co Loan ($20,000,000);
*   the interest paid or capitalised on the Parent Co Loan ($462,500 per quarter, plus the amount of any interest on any capitalised interest);
*   the amount outstanding to be repaid on the repayment of the Parent Co Loan; and
*   the payments or other consideration provided in terms of the NZ Co Letter.

This determination is signed by me on the 17th day of March 2011.
