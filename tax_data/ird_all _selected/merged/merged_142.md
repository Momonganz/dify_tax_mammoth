Unacceptable interpretation - non application of a tax law (Mar 98) (Withdrawn from 1 April 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003)
==============================================================================================================================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS INV-260 Unacceptable interpretation –non application of a tax law. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Summary
-------

In the case where a tax shortfall has been identified and the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer did not apply their mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply.

Where a taxpayer has taken the advice of a tax advisor, or a tax advisor has prepared their tax return the Commissioner has the expectation that the tax advisor applied his/her mind to the tax laws and exercised his/her judgment. The unacceptable interpretation standard will apply unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax advisor did not apply his/her mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation.

This Standard Practice Statement amends SPS INV-205 to the extent that a taxpayer must have turned their mind to the tax laws or made an interpretation to have taken an unacceptable interpretation.

Application
-----------

This practice applies to assessments of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty issued on or after June 1998.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 defines an unacceptable interpretation as follows:

> "In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation -  
>   
> (a) Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and  
>   
> (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct."

Background
----------

Inland Revenue practice- SPS INV-205 set out the policy with respect to "non-application of a tax law" as follows:

> "There may be instances where a taxpayer argues that he or she did not apply a section of the Act, therefore, did not interpret the particular section as applying.  Accordingly, the taxpayer contends that the unacceptable interpretation standard does not apply.
> 
> The non application of a tax law will in all cases be considered to be applying the tax law."

Inland Revenue took the view that, in being liable for a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation of the law, taxpayers do not have to put their minds to the particular tax position taken.

This policy has now been reviewed and will not apply to assessments of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty issued on or after 1 June 1998.

Practice applicable from 1 June 1998
------------------------------------

In the case where a tax shortfall has been identified and the Commissioner is satisfied that a taxpayer did not apply their mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply.  Therefore, no consideration will be given to whether or not the taxpayer has breached the unacceptable interpretation standard.  However, consideration will be given to whether or not the taxpayer has been culpable under the reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion standard

Where a taxpayer has taken the advice of a tax advisor, or a tax advisor has prepared the tax return, Inland Revenue has the expectation that the tax advisor has interpreted the tax laws and exercised his/her judgment and the unacceptable interpretation standard will apply.  This is a rebuttable presumption and Inland Revenue will take this position unless the tax advisor can demonstrate that this is not the case.

Inland Revenue considers that the following is appropriate to each case:

**_(1) Taxpayers who prepare their own returns without the assistance of an advisor_**  
A taxpayer takes a tax position that results in a tax shortfall that is based on a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation.  The taxpayer asserts that he/she did not apply the law because he/she did not consider the issue.

If, by their actions, it can be confirmed that the taxpayer looked at the legislation and demonstrated that they have considered the tax laws with respect to the transaction, Inland Revenue can consider the unacceptable interpretation penalty.

If Inland Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer did not make an interpretation, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not be considered.  However, the taxpayer may have breached the reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion standard and this would need to be considered.

This does not mean that just because Inland Revenue cannot penalise a taxpayer under the objective unacceptable interpretation standard the penalty for lack of reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion will automatically be imposed.  It means that Inland Revenue will consider whether or not those standards have been breached.

**_(2) Taxpayers who have in house tax professionals_**  
A corporate taxpayer employs tax professionals to make decisions upon the tax treatment of its transactions.  The tax employees, also, prepare all of the taxpayer's tax returns.  The taxpayer takes a tax position that results in a tax shortfall that is based on a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation.

In this case, Inland Revenue will take the view that the tax employees will have interpreted the law with respect to the tax positions taken, and the unacceptable interpretation standard applies.  The exception would be if the Commissioner were satisfied that the tax employees did not make an interpretation, in which case, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply.

However, the taxpayer may have breached the reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion standard and this would be considered.

**_(3) Taxpayer seeks advice from an advisor_**  
A taxpayer is unsure of the tax position to take regarding a transaction.  The taxpayer seeks the advice of a tax advisor, and that advisor puts his/her mind to the issue and makes an interpretation.  In this case, the unacceptable interpretation penalty can be imposed.

This same result would occur if the taxpayer engaged a tax advisor to prepare his/her tax returns.  Inland Revenue has the expectation that during preparation of the return, the tax advisor has applied his/her mind to the tax laws and exercised judgment when deciding to take the various tax positions in that return.

The exception would be if the Commissioner were satisfied that the tax advisor did not make an interpretation, in which case, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply.  To be satisfied that a tax agent did not make an interpretation or exercise judgment, Inland Revenue staff will be making inquiries with respect to the tax treatment of transactions in returns prepared by the advisor.

In this case, if the taxpayer has taken reasonable care with the advisor, the taxpayer will have taken reasonable care.

Examples
--------

**_Business taxpayer - deduction claimed for capital item_**  
A business taxpayer employs an office person to complete its tax returns.  The office person has a knowledge of the tax laws with respect to deductible expenditure.

During an audit of the company's 1998 income tax return, it is ascertained that a large item of plant that was purchased during the return period was claimed as deductible expenditure.  The expenditure is disallowed and a tax shortfall results which is based upon the application of a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of an unacceptable interpretation penalty.

The taxpayer contends that, when they took their tax position, they did not consider the tax laws with respect to the item purchased but that they just claimed the total amount of expenditure as noted in the ledger.  They contend that the unacceptable interpretation penalty cannot apply, as they did not make an interpretation of the tax laws.

The company has good systems in place from which the tax returns are prepared.  The particular purchase was coded to repairs and maintenance.  At the time of preparing the tax return, the office person did not check to ensure that items of expenditure that are not deductible for tax purposes were not included.  Also, as the total repairs and maintenance for this year was substantially larger than it was the previous year, the office person should have been put on notice that it may not be correct.

The taxpayer did not put its mind to the tax laws relevant to the claim - they did not make an interpretation.  Therefore, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply.

However, a taxpayer in that category of taxpayer would be aware that they should have reviewed their accounts with respect to expenditure to ensure that capital expenditure was not included in the claim for deductible expenditure.  The company did not do this and is considered to have not taken reasonable care.

Accordingly, the 20% penalty for not taking reasonable care would be imposed.

**_New business taxpayer with professional advisor - GST input claimed early_**  
A taxpayer has purchased a franchise to undertake garden maintenance and landscaping.  The taxpayer is new to this type of business and is not familiar with the tax laws relating to self-employed people.  The taxpayer also registers for GST.

The taxpayer engages the services of a tax advisor to provide tax law advice for both income tax and GST and also to prepare the income tax returns.

During a GST return period, the taxpayer purchased a section that is intended for use in the taxable activity.  The taxpayer was told that a tax invoice would be made available soon, as the property was being purchased from a GST registered person.  During the return period, the deposit had been paid and the contract became unconditional.

All of the relevant information was provided to the tax advisor.  The advisor told the taxpayer to make the claim for the GST input credit for the entire purchase price of the section in the GST return.  The tax advisor told the taxpayer that a tax invoice needed to be held but as it was to be made available shortly, the input claim could be made.

After the GST return is furnished, the taxpayer becomes aware that the vendor of the property is not GST registered.  Therefore, the taxpayer has purchased a second hand good from an unregistered person.

The GST return is audited and the GST input claim relating to the unpaid portion of the property is disallowed.  The tax shortfall is based upon the application of a tax law and exceeded the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation.

Even though the taxpayer had not put his mind to the provisions of the law when taking his tax position, he had put his affairs in the hands of an advisor.  The test is objective, so the efforts of the taxpayer are not taken into consideration.

The tax advisor asserts that the tax laws were not interpreted when the claim for the entire GST input credit was made.  However, it is clear from the conversation with the taxpayer that the tax advisor had put his/her mind to the tax laws.  The tax advisor was aware that the tax invoice was required when the advice was given.  Therefore, the tax advisor had turned his/her mind to the tax laws.

The tax advisor, for the taxpayer, had clearly taken an unacceptable interpretation of the law.  Accordingly, the 20% penalty for unacceptable interpretation would apply.

**_Business taxpayer with tax advisor_**  
The taxpayer is a property developer.  He has been in business for a number of years and purchases houses and sections for development.  He considers that the proceeds of one particular property that he has purchased and developed is not taxable as he and his family have lived in the property for a short period of time prior to sale.

The taxpayer consults the advisor who advises, after reviewing the tax laws, that sale of the property is covered by the exemption in section CD1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and, therefore, not taxable.

Inland Revenue considers that, as there has been a pattern of buying houses and living in them while renovating them prior to sale, that sale of the particular property is part of the taxpayers gross income.

A tax shortfall is ascertained which exceeds the threshold for requiring an unacceptable interpretation, is based upon the tax law and is a tax position which, viewed objectively, is not about as likely as not to be correct.  In this case, the tax advisor has turned his/her mind to the tax laws.

Accordingly, the 20% shortfall for taking an unacceptable interpretation penalty is imposed.

**_No apportionment of GST input claim for assets not used in taxable activity_**  
A taxpayer registers for GST and purchases a farm that will be used in the taxable activity.  Upon completing the first GST return, the taxpayer claims 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property.  No apportionment is made for the fact that part of the property will not be used in the taxable activity.

The return is audited and the portion of the GST input claim relating to non-taxable supplies is disallowed.  The tax shortfall is based upon the application of a tax law and is over the threshold requiring the taxpayer to have an acceptable interpretation.

When questioned, the taxpayer advises that they did not know that they could not claim a GST input credit for the portion of the property that did not relate to the taxable activity.  The taxpayer claims that they did not interpret the law and did not consider it at all.

As the taxpayer did not interpret the law, the unacceptable interpretation penalty does not apply.

When completing the first GST return, a reasonable person in the taxpayer's circumstances would have inquired about which GST input credits could be claimed.  A reasonable person would be expected read Inland Revenue's GST guide or consult a tax advisor.  By not doing this, it is considered that the taxpayer did not take reasonable care.  Accordingly, a 20% penalty for not taking reasonable care would apply.

Gross carelessness (Mar 98) (Withdrawn from 1 April 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003)
======================================================================================================================

INV-210 Gross carelessness – withdrawn from Apr 2003. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement applies to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003.

Introduction
------------

A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer.  The law divides these actions into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below:

  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Not taking reasonable care | 20% |
| Unacceptable interpretation | 20% |
| Gross carelessness | 40% |
| Abusive tax position | 100% |
| Evasion or similar offence | 150% |

These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed.  A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty.

This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of "gross carelessness".

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997.

Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced.  Defaults in employers' obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties.

The penalty provision is generic in application.  This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations).

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the gross carelessness shortfall penalty is to cater for breaches that fall just short of the evasion category but beyond a lack of reasonable care.  The old regime of penal and additional tax failed to cater for these situations.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141C of Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Gross Carelessness-**

1.  A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer's tax position (referred to as "gross carelessness").
2.  The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall.
3.  For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences.
4.  A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer's tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of tax law is also a taxpayer who has not been grossly careless in taking the taxpayer's tax position.

Gross carelessness similar to recklessness
------------------------------------------

Gross carelessness is similar to recklessness.  In fact it is identical to the objective test for recklessness as discussed by the House of Lords in _R v Caldwell_ \[1982\] AC 341, \[1981\] 1 All ER 961.  In this case the House of Lords found that the test of recklessness was objective and may be found to exist where a person whose behaviour is in question fails to give any thought to the consequences of his behaviour.

However, the New Zealand Courts seem to support that the statutory forms of recklessness ought to be given a subjective meaning.  This is supported in _Case P29_ (1992) 14 NZTC where his

> Honour stated:  
> "Where recklessness is alleged the Commissioner must prove that the facts which were actually known to the taxpayer were such that they must have put him on enquiry that the income returned for tax purposes was understated.  Faced with those facts the Commissioner must then show that the taxpayer made the conscious decision to ignore them and to return the understated income without making any further enquiry."

It was considered that as the category was within the civil penalties it was appropriate that the test be objective rather than subjective, with the fixed penalty rate being set to reflect this.  It was for this reason that the new term of gross carelessness was used rather than recklessness.  This was also consistent with the aim of the penalty, being to cater for breaches that fell just short of the evasion category (because of lack of proof of intent) but well beyond not taking reasonable care.

Boundary between gross carelessness and other shortfall penalties
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The definition for gross carelessness is more akin to evasion than not taking reasonable care.  The only essential element keeping them apart is that, for evasion it must be shown that the taxpayer had the necessary "mens rea" (intent) to evade tax.  This is not a necessary element in determining whether a taxpayer has been grossly careless.

Therefore, to determine whether a tax shortfall is the result of gross carelessness consideration should be given to the boundary between evasion and gross carelessness, not failing to take reasonable care.

It is at this end of the spectrum that the distinction becomes clearer, due to the fact that there is a change between the two categories, moving from an objective test (for gross carelessness) to a subjective test (for evasion).  Further to this there is a change in the onus of proof, moving from the taxpayer to the Commissioner, in the case of evasion.

General rules
-------------

**_Lack of reasonable care or gross carelessness  
_**If it is uncertain whether the tax shortfall is the result of not taking reasonable care or gross carelessness, generally the penalty will default to the not taking reasonable care category.  This is because gross carelessness occurs only where a taxpayer's behaviour displays a high degree of carelessness and disregard for the consequences.

**_Gross carelessness or evasion_  
**In determining whether to impose a penalty for gross carelessness or evasion the decision will generally rely on the evidence available and whether it is sufficient to discharge the Commissioner's onus of proof for evasion.  If the evidence is insufficient the penalty will default to the gross carelessness category.

**_Burden and standard of proof_**A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process.  If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts.

The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties, rests with the taxpayer.  They must show that on the "balance of probabilities" they have not been grossly careless.

Standard rate of penalty
------------------------

The standard rate of penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall.

This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the following circumstances:

*   voluntary disclosure before or during an audit
*   voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing
*   temporary tax shortfalls
*   obstruction

Other reference
---------------

An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996).

Summary
-------

Section 141C of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty of gross carelessness, at the rate of 40%, where a default falls just short of the evasion category but well beyond not taking reasonable care.

The definition for gross carelessness is more akin to evasion than not taking reasonable care.  The only essential element keeping them apart is that, for evasion, it must be shown that the taxpayer had the necessary "mens rea" (intent) to evade tax.

Typically, a high level of carelessness will be characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring where this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances.

The penalty is non-negotiable and where a default meets the considerations for gross carelessness the penalty must be imposed.

=========================================================================================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-215 Abusive tax position. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Note: Withdrawn from 1 April 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. The SPS still applies before this date.

Introduction
------------

A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer. The law divides these actions into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Not taking reasonable care | 20% |
| Unacceptable interpretation | 20% |
| Gross carelessness | 40% |
| Abusive tax position | 100% |
| Evasion or similar offence | 150% |

These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed.  A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty.

This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of "abusive tax position".

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997.

Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced.  Defaults in employers' obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties.

The penalty provision is generic in application.  This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations).

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty is to penalise those taxpayers who apply an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law that either results in, or would result in, reducing or removing tax liabilities, or gives tax benefits.  The unacceptable interpretation may be the result of either entering into or acting on an arrangement or simply the interpretation or application of tax laws.  The arrangement or interpretation must have a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, the resulting tax position/s.

It is intended that the provision will apply not only to situations where an anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also where other provisions have been applied.  This is important to ensure that identical conduct is not penalised differently solely because taxpayers are of different levels of sophistication or because Inland Revenue is not required to resort to an anti-avoidance provision.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Abusive tax position -**

1.  The purpose of this section is to penalise those taxpayers who, having applied an unacceptable interpretation to a tax law, have entered into or acted in respect of arrangements or interpreted or applied tax laws with a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, tax positions that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits.  
      
    
2.  A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an abusive tax position (referred to as an "abusive tax position").  
      
    
3.  The penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall.  
      
    
4.  This section applies to a taxpayer only if -
    
    1.  The taxpayer's tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and
    2.  The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position exceeds $10,000.
    
      
    
5.  Section 141B(6) applies for determining the time when a taxpayer takes an abusive tax position.  
      
    
6.  A taxpayer's tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of, either or both of -
    
    1.  A general tax law; or
    2.  A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law.
    
      
    
7.  For the purposes of this Part, an "abusive tax position" means a tax position that,-
    1.  At the time at which the taxpayer's tax position is taken, involves the taking of an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and
    2.  Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes -
        1.  In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or
        2.  Where the tax position does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly.

Criteria to be met
------------------

Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met:

*   The position taken must be an unacceptable interpretation; and  
      
    
*   It must involve over $10,000 tax; and  
      
    
*   There must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax.

Unacceptable interpretation standard
------------------------------------

The unacceptable interpretation standard will first be applied to determine if a penalty is warranted.  This test recognises that there are many uncertainties in law and that more than one valid interpretation of that law is sometimes possible.  It is unreasonable and unfair to penalise a person for an interpretation if there is a reasonable argument that the interpretation is correct.

Threshold
---------

The $10,000 threshold differs from the threshold for an unacceptable interpretation.  The provisions in section 141B(2) relate solely to whether or not a shortfall penalty is charged.  The 1% materiality threshold which applies to the "unacceptable interpretation" penalty therefore does not apply to the "abusive tax position" penalty.

Dominant purpose of avoiding tax
--------------------------------

**Dominant purpose**  
Where there is more than one purpose for entering into the relevant scheme, then section 141D(7)(b) requires that the particular purpose is the dominant purpose.

The Australian High Court decision in _FC of T v Spotless Services Ltd_ (unrep, HC Australia, M32-33, 3 December 1996 ) examined the expression "dominant purpose" and equated the term with "most influential and prevailing or ruling purpose".  Accordingly, if there are three purposes in entering into the arrangement or transaction and one of those purposes is to obtain a tax benefit, then if that purpose (obtaining a tax benefit) is the "most influential" of the three purposes, the dominant purpose test would have arguably been met.

The legislation relating to the shortfall penalty refers to a dominant "purpose".  This differs from section BG 1 - core provisions - (formerly section BB 9) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which refers to "Its purpose or effect is tax avoidance".

It is considered that nothing turns on the distinction between "purpose or effect" and "purpose".  In the context of section BG 1 case law certainly supports this view (_Tayles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1982\] 2 NZLR 726,734).

It could be considered that the term "purpose" is more of a "subjective" term than that of "effect", which is an objective term.  However, the new provision is explicit that the test of whether an arrangement has the dominant purpose of avoiding tax is an objective one.  It is also firmly established in case law that the purpose of an arrangement is to be argued objectively for section BG 1.

In short, the word "purpose" means, not motive, but the effect which is sought to achieve - the end in view.

The section is not concerned with the motives of taxpayers or the desire to avoid tax.  It is only concerned with the means employed to avoid tax (i.e., the arrangement).

**Avoiding tax**  
The concept of "avoiding tax" encompasses the deferral of tax and the claiming of tax credits.  It is considered that "avoiding tax" would incorporate "tax avoidance" as defined in section OB  1 of the Income Tax Act 1994.

However, is the term "avoiding tax" wider than the term "tax avoidance"?

The term "avoiding tax" is likely to be read in the light of the other provisions of the relevant tax law which refer to tax avoidance, but will not require them to be applied.  The penalty will also apply to arrangements which fail under a technical provision rather than a general or specific anti-avoidance provision.

The penalty does not explicitly require an anti-avoidance provision to have been applied:

*   The penalty applies only when the taxpayer's tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation.  This test applies when the taxpayer fails to correctly apply or interpret any provision of tax law.  It is not restricted to anti-avoidance provisions;
*   The penalty applies where the dominant "purpose" is tax avoidance; not when the tax has in fact been avoided;
*   The abusive tax position penalty applies, both to arrangements which are reconstituted under an anti-avoidance provision and to arrangements which are caught by another provision but would otherwise have been subject to an anti-avoidance provision.

In addition, the fact that section 141D(7)(b)(ii) specifically provides for situations where there is no arrangement clarifies that the penalty is not restricted to situations involving the application of an anti-avoidance provision.  Therefore, the abusive tax position penalty can apply when there is not an arrangement, but the tax position taken has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax.

Factors to consider
-------------------

The following are an indication of the some of the factors that must be taken into account when considering whether there is a dominant purpose of avoiding tax.

**Artificiality and contrivance**  
Have the transactions been designed to appear to comply with the legislation? The legal form may not reflect the substance (even though the legal form is effective).

Consideration will be given to the commercial reality of the arrangement.  Are the arrangements or schemes "self-cancelling" (i.e., neutral commercial consequences, leaving only tax effects)?

The importance of the commercial purpose of the transaction as compared to the tax benefit that the relevant taxpayer obtained must be examined.

**Circularity of funding**  
Funding going around in a circle, usually through a tax haven, resulting in income being tax exempt and the related expenditure tax deductible may be considered as an indicator of a tax avoiding arrangement.

**Concealment of information and non-availability of evidence**  
This may occur through the use of a tax haven.  By going through a tax haven disclosure protection may result due to the particular tax haven's secrecy laws.  These laws usually do not allow information to be released to tax authorities, thereby providing an obstacle to the gathering of information to establish whether the transaction or arrangement is artificial or contrived.

**Spurious interpretations**  
Spurious interpretation covers situations where a tax position taken has no or very little basis at law or the interpretation made or position taken is frivolous.  If there is a reasonable basis then it will not be considered spurious (even though this would not be sufficient for the acceptable interpretation standard).

What happens when a Revenue Act has no anti-avoidance provision
---------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned previously section 141D(6) states that an incorrect tax position may result from either a general tax law or a specific or general anti-avoidance tax law.

The fact that a particular Revenue Act does not have an anti-avoidance provision does not mean that the penalty cannot be imposed.  What is required is that the tax position taken is incorrect under a general tax law and has as its dominant purpose the avoidance of tax.  There must however be a tax shortfall.

If the position involves an arrangement which has the effect of ensuring that the treatment is within the interpretation of the law then there would not be a tax shortfall.  The reason being, that the anti-avoidance provisions work by deeming the arrangement to be null and void, thereby allowing the substantive provisions to be applied as intended.  The anti-avoidance provisions are not an assessing provision in themselves; they are a reconstruction provision.  It is the substantive provisions which result in the reassessment.

Publication of name
-------------------

Section 146(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the name of anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position will be published in the Gazette.

This will not occur however in the case of a voluntary disclosure prior to an investigation commencing.

Burden and standard of proof
----------------------------

A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process.  If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts.

The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of shortfall penalties, rests with the taxpayer.  They must show that on the "balance of probabilities" they have not taken an abusive tax position.

Standard rate of penalty
------------------------

The standard rate of penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall.

This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the following circumstances:

*   voluntary disclosure before or during an audit
*   voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing
*   temporary tax shortfalls
*   obstruction

Other reference
---------------

An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996).

Summary
-------

Section 141D of Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a penalty for taking an abusive tax position, at the rate of 100%.

The objective of an avoidance penalty is to deter taxpayers from entering into arrangements which have as their dominant purpose the avoiding of tax.

Before a penalty for an abusive tax position can be imposed, three criteria must be met:

*   the position taken must be an unacceptable interpretation; and
*   it must involve over $10,000 tax; and
*   there must be a dominant purpose of avoiding tax.

Evasion or similar act (Mar 98) (Withdrawn from 1 April 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003).
===========================================================================================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-220 Evasion or similar act. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement applies to tax position taken before 1 April 2003.

Introduction
------------

A shortfall penalty is a penalty imposed as a percentage of a tax shortfall, or deficit or understatement of tax, which results from certain actions on the part of a taxpayer.  The law divides these actions into five categories of fault, or breach, with a specified penalty rate for each category as listed below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Not taking reasonable care | 20% |
| Unacceptable interpretation | 20% |
| Gross carelessness | 40% |
| Abusive tax position | 100% |
| Evasion or similar offence | 150% |

These penalty rates are non-negotiable and where a default occurs the applicable penalty must be imposed. A taxpayer does however have the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty but not the amount of penalty.

This statement deals with defaults that fall within the shortfall penalty category of "evasion or similar act".

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years and to taxable or dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997.

Shortfall penalties apply when there is a deficit or understatement of tax, or where a refund or loss is reduced.  Defaults in employers' obligations are also considered under shortfall penalties.

The penalty provision is generic in application.  This means that it applies to all Inland Revenue Acts (but for Child Support and Student Loans, it applies only to employer obligations).

Purpose
-------

The purpose of the evasion or similar offence shortfall penalty is to provide a penalty for taxpayers who evade the assessment or payment of tax for themselves or others, or who knowingly misapply a deduction or withholding tax, or who knowingly do not make tax deductions, or who obtain a refund or assist others to obtain a refund to which they know they are not entitled.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141E of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Evasion or similar act -**

1.  A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if, in taking a tax position the taxpayer -  
      
    
    1.  evades the assessment or payment of tax on their own behalf or on behalf of any another person; or
    2.  knowingly applies or permits someone else to apply a deduction or withholding of tax which they were required to make to the Commissioner; or  
          
        
    3.  knowingly does not make a deduction or withholding of tax which they are required to make; or  
          
        
    4.  obtains a refund or payment of tax knowing that they are not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment; or  
          
        
    5.  enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment.
    
      
      
    
2.  No person shall be chargeable with a shortfall penalty under subsection (1)(b) if that person satisfies the Commissioner that the amount of the deduction has been accounted for, and that the person's failure to account for it within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident, or some other cause beyond the person's control.  
      
    
3.  If a taxpayer enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment under a tax law, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person's tax position had been the taxpayer's tax position.  
      
    
4.  The penalty payable for evasion or a similar act described in subsection (1) is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall.

Discussion
----------

At the top end of the scale of non-compliance is a wilful or knowing breach of an obligation.  The civil penalty for tax evasion applies to all tax types.

Tax evasion involves a deliberate attempt to cheat the revenue.  This may include a taxpayer obtaining refunds (tax credits, rebates) knowing that he or she is not lawfully entitled to them or knowingly not accounting for tax deductions to the Commissioner.

Generally speaking there are two categories of behaviour that are subject to the shortfall penalty under the provisions of section 141E.  Subsections (1)(b) to (e) require only knowledge of the breach, whereas breaches within subsection (1)(a) require the knowledge and intent to evade.

Taxpayer enables another to obtain a refund
-------------------------------------------

Section 141E(1)(e) provides that a shortfall penalty is payable if the taxpayer "enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment".

However, because the shortfall penalty is a fixed percentage of the taxpayer's tax shortfall, no penalty would normally be able to be imposed, as it is the recipient of the refund or payment who has incurred a tax shortfall, not the taxpayer.  Subsection (3) overcomes this problem by deeming that "the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person's tax position had been the taxpayer's tax position."

Prosecution
-----------

Section 149(5) states that if a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a taxpayer for taking an incorrect tax position, the Commissioner may not subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position.

Prosecution does not preclude the Commissioner from imposing the civil penalty for evasion.  It is not necessary for a taxpayer to be prosecuted before a shortfall penalty is imposed as the standards of proof are different.

**_Consideration of shortfall penalty after unsuccessful prosecution_**  
Section 149(4) states that a shortfall penalty may be imposed after a prosecution, whether or not the prosecution is successful.

If prosecution action for evasion is unsuccessful, a shortfall penalty can still be imposed for evasion or similar act, because the standard of proof is the balance of probabilities, even though the onus of proof is still on the Commissioner.

However, the reason why the prosecution was not successful will be considered.  If it was dismissed on technical grounds (for example some procedural matters in the prosecution not complied with), clearly a shortfall penalty can be imposed.  If the evidence available to the court was clearly inadequate, then a shortfall penalty will not be able to be imposed.

If it is intended to prosecute a taxpayer and later impose a shortfall penalty, the taxpayer will be advised that after the prosecution, whether or not the prosecution is successful, the imposition of a shortfall penalty will be considered.

Tax deduction offences
----------------------

Under section 141E, a shortfall penalty for evasion includes tax deduction offences (including Child Support and Student Loan deductions).  This is both knowingly not deducting tax and knowingly not accounting for tax deducted.  Taxpayers can also be prosecuted for a knowledge offence under section 143A for either of the above (knowingly not deducting tax and knowingly not accounting for tax deductions) or under section 143B for evasion for not deducting tax.

Statutory defence
-----------------

Section 141E(2) provides that a shortfall penalty is not chargeable for failure to account for deductions to the Commissioner if the taxpayer is able to prove that:

*   the amount of the tax deduction has been accounted for, and
*   the taxpayer's failure to account for the tax within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident or other cause beyond the person's control

These points have to be met for the taxpayer to be excused from any liability.

**_Beyond the person's control_**  
Beyond control does not include such circumstances as financial reasons, or the actions of staff.  It may however include such circumstances as hospitalisation, accidents, illness, and other such causes.

Circumstances beyond one's control cannot be a continuing defence, i.e., it cannot be used as a defence month after month.

**_Factors to consider_**  
Some of the factors that may be considered are:

*   Length of time deducting and awareness of obligation to make payments by the due date
*   Who is responsible for drawing up deduction details and forwarding payment by the due date
*   Reason/s why the deductions were not paid by the due date
*   Was the taxpayer aware that payment had not been made by the due date and that an offence was being committed?
*   When did they become aware that payment had not been made and what steps were taken to rectify the situation?
*   For what purpose(s) were the deductions used when not paid by the due date?

Publication of name
-------------------

Section 146(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the name of anyone liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion will be published in the Gazette.

This will not occur however in the case of a voluntary disclosure prior to an investigation commencing.

Burden and standard of proof
----------------------------

A taxpayer has the right to challenge the decision to impose a shortfall penalty through the disputes process.  If the issue can not be resolved through the disputes process the taxpayer has the normal rights of review through the courts.

The burden of proof, in civil proceedings relating to the imposition of the evasion or similar act shortfall penalty, rests with the Commissioner.  The standard of proof for imposition of a shortfall penalty for evasion is the "balance of probabilities".

Standard rate of penalty
------------------------

The standard rate of penalty payable for evasion or a similar act is 150% of the resulting tax shortfall.

This rate may be adjusted by varying rates in the following circumstances:

*   voluntary disclosure before or during an audit
*   voluntary disclosure at the time of return filing
*   temporary tax shortfalls
*   obstruction

Other reference
---------------

An explanation and examples of shortfall penalties and other offences and penalties can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 (October 1996).

Summary
-------

Section 141E of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a taxpayer who evades or enables another person to evade the payment of tax is liable to pay a shortfall penalty of 150% of the resulting shortfall.

Situations where a refund or payment of tax is unlawfully received are also covered.

A shortfall penalty is not chargeable if the taxpayer is able to prove to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that:

*   the amount of the tax deduction has been accounted for, and
*   the taxpayer's failure to account for the tax within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident or other cause beyond the person's control.

Where the taxpayer enables another person to obtain a refund or payment of tax, knowing that the other person is not entitled to the refund or payment, the taxpayer is liable to pay to the Commissioner an amount equal to the shortfall penalty that would have been imposed if the other person's tax position had been the taxpayer's tax position.

Temporary shortfall - permanent reversal (May 98) (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-230 Temporary shortfall - permanent reversal (May 98). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Summary
-------

This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner's position on permanent reversal as it applies to a temporary shortfall.

The Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed if:

*   It appears from the taxpayer's actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or
*   Through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself.

This statement does not apply to corrections, as the Commissioner cannot be satisfied that they will be corrected in the next period.

Application date
----------------

This Standard Practice Statement applies to assessments of shortfall penalties issued on or after 1 May 1998.

If you have been assessed with a shortfall penalty between 1 May 1998 and the date of this statement, please contact the Inland Revenue officer concerned and, if applicable, your assessment will be adjusted to reflect the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty.

Background
----------

Inland Revenue's practice has been to restrict the temporary shortfall reduction to instances where Inland Revenue has received the return containing the correction or reversal before the taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation.

An issue has arisen concerning the timing of GST input credits.  Many of the resulting refunds claimed can be quite substantial and could be subject to GST checks before the release of the refunds.  GST refund checks are undertaken very quickly after the returns are received which means that the taxpayers may not have had an opportunity to furnish the following return which would permanently reverse the overclaim made in the previous period.

The tax shortfall is actually a timing shortfall but Inland Revenue's practice, prior to 1 May 1998, was not to allow the temporary shortfall reduction unless the return containing the reversal had been furnished prior to notification of audit or investigation.

This situation could also arise in other tax types, for example, income tax, FBT or PAYE.

Legislation
-----------

A temporary shortfall is defined in section 141I of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  If a taxpayer is considered liable for a shortfall penalty and the tax shortfall is a temporary shortfall, the penalty warranted will be reduced by 75%.

> Subsection (3) defines a temporary shortfall as follows:
> 
> A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that -  
>   
> a. The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and  
>   
> b. No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and  
>   
> c. No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and  
>   
> d. The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation.

Practice applicable from 1 May 1998
-----------------------------------

**_The Commissioner's new interpretation of a temporary shortfall_**

The Commissioner considers that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if:

*   it appears from the taxpayer's actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or
*   through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself.

To reverse a situation does not necessarily mean to achieve a complete remedy – it only means to take steps that will lead to the remedy in due course.  For example, when a ship goes off course, one remedies it by turning it back towards the right heading.  The mistake has been remedied when the turn is made but getting the ship back to the position it should be in takes some time to take effect.

Using this rationale, when the taxpayer claims the entire GST input claim in the first GST return, the taxpayer has made the reversal because no claim for an input credit relating to the same property purchase will be made in the following return.  This means the reversal will be treated as made when the full input claim is made in the earlier return.  The same would apply to income tax or any other revenue.

In these scenarios, the taxpayer would be entitled to a 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall.  This is because the taxpayer has made the claim in the earlier return period so they cannot make the claim again in the later period.

The case may not be so clear when gross income is not returned in a correct return period.  For example, an auditor ascertains that a taxpayer should have returned a sale in the return being audited.

In order to qualify for the temporary shortfall reduction, Inland Revenue would have to be satisfied that the sale would have been returned in the next return period.  This will involve making enquiries of the taxpayer and checking the internal systems, bank statements, etc.  If the sale is recorded in the system that the taxpayer normally prepares the tax return from, Inland Revenue could safely assume that the sale would have been returned in the next return period.  In this case, Inland Revenue would allow the temporary shortfall reduction of any shortfall penalty warranted.

Arguably, a 5% penalty for a full year's deferral of income tax is much lower than a 5% penalty for deferral of GST for one, two or six months.  Inland Revenue considers that the reason for shortfall penalties should not be confused; shortfall penalties address culpability.  Interest will be charged to taxpayers for paying tax late.  When the adjustment is made to the return, interest will be charged from the time that the taxpayer should have paid the correct amount of tax.

In summary, a taxpayer is not required to have furnished the return containing the reversal prior to notification of audit, but Inland Revenue must be satisfied that, had the following return been received, the reversal would have been made.

The extended interpretation of temporary shortfall will be available for all tax types including income tax.  This interpretation of the word "reversed" applies only to the definition of temporary shortfall.

Examples
--------

**_GST Input tax claim_**

A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of real property.  The full purchase price of the property is $750,000 and the property developer pays a deposit of $75,000 on 5 April 1998.  The balance of the purchase price is payable on 5 May 1998.

The vendor of the property is not registered for GST, so the property developer is purchasing a secondhand good and is entitled to claim a GST input credit only on the amount actually paid.  The property developer is registered for GST on an invoice basis and files GST returns every two months.

In the GST return for the period ended 30 April 1998, the property developer claims an input credit of $83,333 which is 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property.  The correct claim in that period is $8,333, so there is a tax shortfall of $75,000.

As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and is over the specified threshold, the developer must have an acceptable interpretation for the tax position taken.  As the standard has been breached, they are liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall.

The taxpayer is entitled to claim 1/9 of the payment that will be made on 5 May 1998 in the GST return for the period ended 30 June 1998.  The taxpayer has already made the claim in the previous GST return, and was not intending to make the claim in the June GST return.  Therefore, at the time of making the full claim in the April return, the taxpayer had permanently reversed the tax shortfall, as they never intended to make a double claim, even though, due to the speed of the audit, the May/June return had not been received.

In this case, the 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall is available.

  

**_GST Output tax not returned_**

As part of his taxable activity, a taxpayer entered into an unconditional agreement to sell real property.

The GST return for the period ended 31 May 1998 was audited and it was noted that output tax with respect to the deposit only had been returned.

The taxpayer is queried and advises that he is going to return the balance of the sale in the next return as that is when he will receive the monies outstanding for the property.

As the time of supply was triggered upon receipt of the deposit, a tax shortfall is ascertained for the balance of the property sale that was not returned.

The taxpayer advises that he wasn't sure whether he should return the entire sale and had intended making an inquiry but just didn't get around to it.  It is considered that a reasonable person in the taxpayer's category of taxpayer, when unsure, would have obtained advice prior to preparing his GST return.  Accordingly, the taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care.

The taxpayer prepares his returns from his bank statements; therefore, the internal system will pick up the receipt of the balance of the sale of the property.  It is clear that the output would have been returned in the next period.  Therefore, the tax shortfall has been reversed even though the following return has not been received because of the speed of the audit.

In this case, the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty would be warranted.

**_Correction_**

A taxpayer prepares the GST return and claims a GST input credit for some overseas travel and personal expenses.  An audit is undertaken and a tax shortfall is ascertained for the above mentioned claims.

There is no guarantee that the incorrect input claims will be corrected in the following GST return.  Therefore, if culpability were established, no reduction for a temporary shortfall is available.

Temporary shortfall - permanent reversals (Sep 99)
==================================================

INV-231 (Sep 1999) sets out information on permanent reversal as it applies to a temporary shortfall.

Summary
-------

This SPS replaces the Standard Practice Statement INV-230 which was issued in the _Tax Information Bulletin_, Volume Ten, No.5, May 1998.  Standard Practice Statement INV-231 is effective from the date of publication.

This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner's position on permanent reversal as it applies to a temporary shortfall.

The Commissioner will accept that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed if:

*   It appears from the taxpayer's actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or  
      
    
*   Through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself.

This statement does not apply to corrections, as the Commissioner cannot be satisfied that they will be corrected in a later period.

Application Date
----------------

This Standard Practice Statement applies to assessments of shortfall penalties issued on or after 1 May 1998.

If you have been assessed with a shortfall penalty between 1 May 1998 and the date of this statement, please contact the Inland Revenue officer concerned and, if applicable, your assessment will be adjusted to reflect the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty.

Background
----------

Inland Revenue's practice has been to restrict the temporary shortfall reduction to instances where Inland Revenue has received the return containing the correction or reversal before the taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation.

An issue has arisen concerning the timing of GST input credits.  Many of the resulting refunds claimed can be quite substantial and could be subject to GST checks before the release of the refunds.  GST refund checks are undertaken very quickly after the returns are received which means that the taxpayers may not have had an opportunity to furnish a following return which would permanently reverse the overclaim made in a previous period.

The tax shortfall is actually a timing shortfall but Inland Revenue's practice, prior to 1 May 1998, was not to allow the temporary shortfall reduction unless the return containing the reversal had been furnished prior to notification of audit or investigation.

This situation could also arise in other tax types, for example, income tax, FBT or PAYE.

Legislation
-----------

A temporary shortfall is defined in section 141I of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  If a taxpayer is considered liable for a shortfall penalty and the tax shortfall is a temporary shortfall, the penalty warranted will be reduced by 75%.

Subsection (3) defines a temporary shortfall as follows:

A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that

1.  The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and  
      
    
2.  No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and  
      
    
3.  No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and  
      
    
4.  The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation.

Practice applicable from 1 May 1998
-----------------------------------

**_The Commissioner's new interpretation of a temporary shortfall_**

The Commissioner considers that a tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected if:

*   it appears from the taxpayer's actions that steps taken will remedy the tax shortfall, or  
      
    
*   through operation of law or circumstances, the matter will reverse itself.

To reverse a situation does not necessarily mean to achieve a complete remedy - it only means to take steps that will lead to the remedy in due course. For example, when a ship goes off course, one remedies it by turning it back towards the right heading. The mistake has been remedied when the turn is made but getting the ship back to the position it should be in takes some time to take effect.

Using this rationale, when the taxpayer claims the entire GST input claim in the first GST return, the taxpayer has made the reversal because no claim for an input credit relating to the same property purchase will be made in a later return. This means the reversal will be treated as made when the full input claim is made in the earlier return. The same would apply to income tax or any other revenue.

In these scenarios, the taxpayer would be entitled to a 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall. This is because the taxpayer has made the claim in the earlier return period so they cannot make the claim again in the later period.

The case may not be so clear when gross income is not returned in a correct return period. For example, an auditor ascertains that a taxpayer should have returned a sale in the return being audited.

In order to qualify for the temporary shortfall reduction, Inland Revenue would have to be satisfied that the sale would have been returned in a later return period. This will involve making enquiries of the taxpayer and checking the internal systems, bank statements, etc. If the sale is recorded in the system that the taxpayer normally prepares the tax return from, Inland Revenue could safely assume that the sale would have been returned in the next return period. In some situations consideration of the taxpayer's systems may indicate that the sale would have been returned in an even later return period. In both of these cases, Inland Revenue would allow the temporary shortfall reduction of any shortfall penalty warranted.

Arguably, a 5% penalty for a full year's deferral of income tax is much lower than a 5% penalty for deferral of GST for one, two or six months. Inland Revenue considers that the reason for shortfall penalties should not be confused; shortfall penalties address culpability. Interest will be charged to taxpayers for paying tax late. When the adjustment is made to the return, interest will be charged from the time that the taxpayer should have paid the correct amount of tax.

In summary, a taxpayer is not required to have furnished the return containing the reversal prior to notification of audit, but Inland Revenue must be satisfied that, the reversal would have been made in a following return.

The extended interpretation of temporary shortfall will be available for all tax types including income tax. This interpretation of the word "reversed" applies only to the definition of temporary shortfall.

Examples
--------

_GST Input tax claim_  
A property developer enters into an unconditional sale and purchase agreement for the purchase of real property. The full purchase price of the property is $750,000 and the property developer pays a deposit of $75,000 on 5 April 1998. The balance of the purchase price is payable on 5 May 1998.

The vendor of the property is not registered for GST, so the property developer is purchasing a secondhand good and is entitled to claim a GST input credit only on the amount actually paid. The property developer is registered for GST on an invoice basis and files GST returns every two months.

In the GST return for the period ended 30 April 1998, the property developer claims an input credit of $83,333 which is 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property. The correct claim in that period is $8,333, so there is a tax shortfall of $75,000.

As the matter relates to an issue of interpretation and is over the specified threshold, the developer must have an acceptable interpretation for the tax position taken. As the standard has been breached, they are liable to a shortfall penalty of 20% of the tax shortfall.

The taxpayer is entitled to claim 1/9 of the payment that will be made on 5 May 1998 in the GST return for the period ended 30 June 1998. The taxpayer has already made the claim in the previous GST return, and was not intending to make the claim in the June GST return. Therefore, at the time of making the full claim in the April return, the taxpayer had permanently reversed the tax shortfall, as they never intended to make a double claim, even though, due to the speed of the audit, the May/June return had not been received.

In this case, the 75% reduction for a temporary shortfall is available.

_GST output tax not returned_  
As part of his taxable activity, a taxpayer entered into an unconditional agreement to sell real property.

The GST return for the period ended 31 May 1998 was audited and it was noted that output tax with respect to the deposit only had been returned.

The taxpayer is queried and advises that he is going to return the balance of the sale in the next return as that is when he will receive the monies outstanding for the property.

As the time of supply was triggered upon receipt of the deposit, a tax shortfall is ascertained for the balance of the property sale that was not returned.

The taxpayer advises that he wasn't sure whether he should return the entire sale and had intended making an inquiry but just didn't get around to it. It is considered that a reasonable person in the taxpayer's category of taxpayer, when unsure, would have obtained advice prior to preparing his GST return. Accordingly, the taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care.

The taxpayer prepares his returns from his bank statements; therefore, the internal system will pick up the receipt of the balance of the sale of the property. It is clear that the output would have been returned in next period. Therefore, the tax shortfall has been reversed even though the following return has not been received because of the speed of the audit.

In this case, the 75% reduction to the shortfall penalty would be warranted.

_Correction_  
A taxpayer prepares the GST return and claims a GST input credit for some overseas travel and personal expenses. An audit is undertaken and a tax shortfall is ascertained for the above mentioned claims.

There is no guarantee that the incorrect input claims will be corrected in the following GST return.Therefore, if culpability were established, no reduction for a temporary shortfall is available.

Payment of shortfall penalty using losses (Mar 98) (WITHDRAWN)
==============================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-245 Payment of shortfall penalty using losses. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This statement deals with the situation where a taxpayer in a loss situation can elect to use losses to pay shortfall penalties. The losses may be either:

*   current year losses
*   losses carried forward from previous periods.

Application
-----------

The penalties apply to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income tax years. There is however no requirement that the losses utilised are incurred in these years.

Legislation
-----------

Section IG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994:

**Losses may be used to pay penalties**

(1) A taxpayer may elect to use a net loss of the taxpayer to pay a shortfall penalty assessed in respect of an income tax liability, if -

1.  The net loss available to be offset against net income of the taxpayer in the income year of the shortfall penalty; and
2.  The taxpayer notifies the Commissioner of the election within the due date period for the payment of the shortfall penalty.

(1A) A wholly-owned group of companies may elect, in the manner provided in subsection (1), to apply a loss incurred by a company in the wholly-owned group in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on any company in that group.

(2) If a taxpayer makes an election under subsection (1) in relation to current year losses and the Commissioner subsequently issues a determination of net loss confirming that the net losses are available to be offset in the current year, the time that the net losses are offset will be the time of the election.

(3) Each dollar of net loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty

1.  Counts as an amount equal to one dollar multiplied by the tax rate; and
2.  Will, from the date the loss is used, no longer be available for use by a person.

(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the term ‘tax rate' means the rate of tax or lowest marginal rate of tax that would apply to the taxpayer during the return period to which the relevant tax shortfall relates, if the taxpayer had tax to pay.

(5) In this section, ‘income year' includes any part of a year that, by virtue of section IF 1 or section IG 2, may be taken into account for loss continuity or group purposes.

Current year losses
-------------------

A taxpayer who has no losses carried forward from prior years, or has insufficient losses to eliminate both tax and penalty, but who expects to have losses in the current year, can elect to use those losses, even though the final loss for that current year has not been established.

Section IG 9A(2) provides that if the taxpayer does incur sufficient losses for that current income tax year, then the shortfall penalties will be deemed to have been paid by the due date.  However, if at the end of the income year the taxpayer does not incur sufficient losses, late payment penalties and interest will be imposed on the tax shortfall penalty that should have been absorbed by the losses.

Notification to the Commissioner
--------------------------------

If a taxpayer wishes to use losses to offset income tax shortfall penalties they must notify the Commissioner of this intention prior to the due date of the shortfall penalty.

Notification may be in either written or verbal form.

#### Only available for income tax shortfall penalties

Losses can be used only to offset against shortfall penalties on income tax shortfalls.  They are not available to be offset for example, against shortfall penalties on PAYE as this is not income tax to the employer.

Losses can only be used to offset income tax penalties as losses are, as defined in the Income Tax Act 1994, "available to be offset against assessable income".  Therefore, as penalties which relate to anything other than income tax are not assessable income items, the losses cannot be offset against them.

#### Wholly-owned companies

Section IG 10(1A) provides that a company in a whollyowned group of companies may apply a loss in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on any company in that group.

#### Loss must be available in year penalty imposed

It should be noted that losses must be available in the year in which the shortfall penalty is imposed.  For example, if adjustments are made to the 1998 return and penalties imposed in 2000, losses must be available in 2000.

#### Loss conversion Individuals

When dealing with an individual the lowest marginal tax rate applying to the taxpayer in the year in which the shortfall penalty exists is the rate used to calculate the offset value of the losses.

#### Other entities

When dealing with a company or other taxable entity the tax rate applying to the taxpayer in the year in which the shortfall penalty exists is the rate used to calculate the offset value of the losses.

#### Loss not available for future offset

Section IG 10(3)(b) provides that if losses are used in this way, they are not available to be offset against future income.

Summary
-------

Under Section IG 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994 a taxpayer in a loss situation can elect to use losses to pay shortfall penalties.  Losses can be used only to offset against shortfall penalties on income tax shortfalls.

Voluntary disclosures (May 98) (WITHDRAWN)
==========================================

Withdrawn statement INV-250 Voluntary disclosures (May 98). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

The voluntary disclosure system reflects the savings to the Revenue from voluntary admissions of irregularities, and other benefits of taxpayer co-operation with Inland Revenue

There are two general types of voluntary disclosure:

*   voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit
*   voluntary disclosure after notification of an audit

A taxpayer can also make a disclosure of the tax position taken in their tax return at the time of filing.

Legislation
-----------

Section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994:

**Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure -**

1.  A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either:
    1.  Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "pre-notification disclosure"); or
    2.  After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "post-notification disclosure").
2.  The Commissioner may from time to time:
    1.  Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and
    2.  The form in which it must be provided.
3.  The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced:
    1.  For pre-notification disclosure is 75%
    2.  For post-notification disclosure is 40%.
4.  The taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if:
    1.  The taxpayer; or
    2.  An officer of the taxpayer; or
    3.  A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or
    4.  A tax advisor acting for the taxpayer; or
    5.  A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or
    6.  A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer, - is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started.
5.  An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of:
    1.  The end of the first interview an officer of the Department has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and
    2.  The time when:
        1.  An officer of the Department inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and
        2.  The taxpayer is notified of the inspection.

Voluntary disclosure methods
----------------------------

Taxpayers can make a voluntary disclosure in any one of the following ways:

*   by a visit
*   by telephone call
*   by letter to the Inland Revenue
*   during an interview

#### Visits and telephone calls

If a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure by visiting or telephoning Inland Revenue, as much information as possible will need to be provided by the taxpayer.

Any officer is able to record a voluntary disclosure when a taxpayer comes into or contacts Inland Revenue.  All verbal disclosures must be followed up in writing and, if possible, signed by the taxpayer.

#### Written disclosure

If a voluntary disclosure is received in writing between the time of notification and the first interview then it will be referred to the appropriate office for the auditor who is conducting the audit or investigation.  The auditor must incorporate this as correspondence relating to the audit or investigation.

Acknowledgement should be made to the taxpayer that the disclosure has been received.

#### During the first interview

Disclosures made during the first interview will be accepted by the investigator.  The investigator must consider whether the disclosure is complete and reveals all the relevant information necessary to ascertain the correct tax position.  The disclosure will then be submitted along with the audit report, to the team leader for approval.

Notification
------------

Subsection 141G(4) provides that a taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation, if any of the following persons have received notification:

*   the taxpayer;
*   an officer of the taxpayer;
*   a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies);
*   a tax adviser acting for the taxpayer;
*   a partner in a partnership;
*   a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer.

An officer includes a director, secretary, receiver or liquidator. It does not include an employee.

#### Time of notification

Notification will be the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer or agent of the written advice or the time of a telephone call advising the commencement of the audit or investigation.

If the exact time of receipt of the written notice becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by section 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  Any telephone call advising of an audit or investigation will be followed up by written advice as soon as possible, preferably the same day.

#### Unannounced visits

In the case of Registration Checks and other unannounced visits, the date of first contact with the taxpayer will be the date of notification.

#### Date an audit or investigation starts

Subsection (5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of:

*   the end of the first interview an Inland Revenue officer has with either the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative, after the taxpayer receives the notice; or
*   the time when:
    *   an officer of Inland Revenue inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives notice, and
    *   the time the taxpayer is notified of the inspection.

#### Taxpayer's representative present at interview

If the taxpayer's representative is present at the first interview, but not the taxpayer, the taxpayer is not later able to claim the benefit of a post-notification disclosure, even if the agent was not given any information by the taxpayer from which to make a disclosure.

#### Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company

An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries within the group.  In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notified.  If the parent company had received notification that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit.

However, if another company in the group has been notified that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notification of an audit.

When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notified at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company and not separate entities.

Full disclosure
---------------

The disclosure must be full and complete.  This does not necessarily mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar but does require the providing of enough information to enable the investigator to make an assessment.  Each case will have to be considered on its own merits.

If a taxpayer is not able to make a full disclosure at the first point of contact with Inland Revenue, they may still make the disclosure and advise the Commissioner when the remaining information will be provided.  It is considered that where taxpayers require further time to obtain more information, then adequate time should be given.

#### Minimum details required

To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided:

*   taxpayer's details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times);
*   the nature of the errors or omissions
*   an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred;
*   enough information to enable an assessment to be made;
*   a declaration and signature by taxpayer, if possible.

#### Several tax shortfalls

All tax shortfalls must be considered separately.  If there are two tax shortfalls, one being the subject of voluntary disclosure and the other being detected by an audit, then the one detected by the audit will not come within the voluntary disclosure regime.  However, the other tax shortfall will still come within the voluntary disclosure regime, assuming full and complete disclosure of that tax shortfall.

If the items are identical or similar they must be treated as one tax shortfall. Therefore, this would result in the taxpayer not satisfying the requirements of a full and complete voluntary disclosure.

#### Disclosure of another tax type

If an audit is being carried out on one tax type and the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure regarding another tax type, and they have not been notified that the other tax type is being audited, then the taxpayer will qualify for voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit.

#### Disclosure of another period

It is common for a notice of intention to carry out an audit to state that a particular year/period is to be audited but previous years/periods may be looked at if necessary.  The year/period referred to only is examined in the first instance.  If some matter arising from the audit means that earlier years/periods are to be examined, the taxpayer is advised by the investigator that this will be done.  If the investigator had not advised the taxpayer that an earlier year/period is being examined, then the taxpayer is able to make a pre-notification disclosure for that year/period.

Disclosure forms
----------------

The voluntary disclosure form is IR 282A and covers both pre-notification and post-notification disclosures.

#### Signing of disclosure form

Where possible the taxpayer should sign the disclosure form. However, an unsigned disclosure will still be accepted.  Although it is desirable for the protection of both the taxpayer and the department that disclosures be in writing and signed by the taxpayer, if the taxpayer will not do this an unsigned or even a verbal disclosure may be accepted.

#### Letter sufficient

A letter sent to Inland Revenue will suffice as a declaration without the need for the taxpayer to also complete the form, assuming it covers the required information sufficiently.

Amendments to returns
---------------------

Section 113 provides the Commissioner with the broad power to amend assessments to "ensure the correctness thereof".

An amendment under this provision is appropriate to assess previously undisclosed income which is advised by a taxpayer.  The provision may also be used to reduce an assessment where an error in the assessment is apparent on the face of the claim.  For example, arithmetical errors or unclaimed rebates; claims which, had they been made at the appropriate time, would have been accepted without further consideration.

If the disclosed income is non-contentious, an adjustment may be made under section 113 and the disputes resolution process will not apply.

Time bar and reopening assessments
----------------------------------

Before assessments are issued following a voluntary disclosure, the effect of section 108 is to be considered.

Section 108 (as amended) provides that where a taxpayer has furnished a tax return and has been assessed for tax, the amount of the assessment may not be increased more than four years from the end of the income year in which the return was furnished.

However, the Commissioner may form an opinion to reopen the assessment outside the time bar if the return either:

*   is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or
*   omits all mention of income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source.

Section 108A contains a similar provision relating to GST.

Disclosure at time of filing
----------------------------

A taxpayer can make a disclosure of the tax position taken, in relation to an unacceptable interpretation or abusive tax position, in their tax return at the time of filing.  Provided the disclosure is adequate and the position taken is not frivolous, taxpayers will be eligible for a reduced penalty if they are found to have an unacceptable interpretation.

For the disclosure to be effective, the taxpayer must provide full and relevant arguments for the tax position taken.

#### Disclosure form

Disclosure will be required to be made on a specified form, IR 282B.

#### Information required

The following information will be required in order to satisfy the requirement of adequate disclosure:

*   taxpayer's details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth, contact telephone and contact times);
*   overview of the position taken;
*   interpretation of case law on the subject, contents of any tax opinions, legal articles and related material;
*   any relevant Inland Revenue public ruling;
*   a calculation, where necessary, to show the position and how it was arrived at;
*   a declaration and signature by taxpayer.

#### Filing of disclosure forms

The disclosure form will be required to be filed in conjunction with the return in which the particular tax position has been taken.  For E-Filed returns the disclosure form will need to be forwarded separately to Inland Revenue.

Reduction rates
---------------

The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced is:

*   for pre-notification disclosure - 75%
*   for post-notification disclosure - 40%

The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure at the time of filing is 75 percent.

### No prosecution or publication of name

If a voluntary disclosure is full and complete:

*   there will not be a prosecution, and
*   there will be no publication of name for any shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act or for taking an abusive tax position.

Summary
-------

A taxpayer may make a disclosure either before he or she receives the first notice that an audit or investigation is to be undertaken ("pre-notification disclosure"), after the first notification but before the audit or investigation starts ("post-notification disclosure") or at the time of filing a tax return.

The disclosure will result in a specific reduction in the applicable rate of shortfall penalty.

The Commissioner may at any time specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure and advise the form in which it must be provided.

Voluntary disclosures (Apr 02) (WITHDRAWN)
==========================================

Withdrawn statement INV-251 Voluntary disclosures. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) applies to voluntary disclosures under section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It establishes guidelines for making a voluntary disclosure, the timing of notification and what constitutes a voluntary disclosure.

Application
-----------

This SPS replaces SPS INV-250 and will apply from 1 May 2002.

The major change from SPS INV-250 is in respect of the Commissioner's practice regarding prosecution in the event of a voluntary disclosure. The new practice is that prosecution may be undertaken in cases of evasion and fraud when a post-notification disclosure is made. Pre-notification disclosures will still have full immunity from prosecution.

Summary
-------

A taxpayer may make a voluntary disclosure either before being notified of a pending tax audit or investigation ("pre-notification disclosure") or after the first notification but before the audit or investigation starts ("post-notification disclosure").

The disclosure must be full and complete. The minimum details required are:

*   taxpayer's details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth/incorporation, contact telephone number and contact times);
*   the nature of the errors or omissions;
*   an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred;
*   adequate information to enable an assessment of the tax shortfall to be made;
*   a declaration signed by the taxpayer, if possible;
*   further information as is necessary to make an assessment.

A full and complete disclosure will result in a reduction in the applicable rate of shortfall penalty.

Where a pre-notification disclosure is made Inland Revenue will not consider prosecution. For a post-notification disclosure prosecution may be considered in cases of evasion or similar offending (ie those offences listed in section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

All legislative references in this SPS are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise specified.

Background
----------

The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance. It relies on taxpayers meeting their obligations under the tax laws, for example, filing tax returns and returning all income. The voluntary disclosure system provides an incentive to taxpayers to determine their correct tax liability. It also reflects the savings to Inland Revenue from voluntary admissions of irregularities and other benefits of co-operation by taxpayers. By making a full and complete voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer will get the advantage of reduced levels in any shortfall penalty imposed.

If a taxpayer makes a pre-notification disclosure, the level of any shortfall penalty will be reduced by 75%. If a post-notification disclosure is made, the reduction in shortfall penalty will be 40%.

Legislation
-----------

#### Sections 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides as follows:

**141G Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure-**

1.  A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141E may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either  
    (a) Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "pre-notification disclosure"); or  
    (b) After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as "post-notification disclosure").  
      
    
2.  The Commissioner may from time to time-  
    (a) Specify the information required for a full voluntary disclosure; and  
    (b) The form in which it must be provided.  
      
    
3.  The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced-  
    (a) For pre-notification disclosure is 75%  
    (b) For post-notification disclosure is 40%.  
      
    
4.  The taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if-  
    (a) The taxpayer; or  
    (b) An officer of the taxpayer; or  
    (c) A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or

Standard Practice
-----------------

#### Voluntary Disclosure Methods

Taxpayers can make a voluntary disclosure in any one of the following ways:

*   by visiting an Inland Revenue office
*   by telephone call
*   by letter, fax or e-mail
*   during an interview

_Visits and telephone calls_  
If a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure by visiting or telephoning Inland Revenue, as much information as possible will need to be provided by the taxpayer.

Any Inland Revenue officer is able to record a voluntary disclosure when a taxpayer comes into or contacts Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will request taxpayers making a voluntary disclosure to sign a form reflecting their disclosure.

_Written disclosure_  
If a voluntary disclosure is received in writing between the time of first notification of the audit and the first interview it will be referred to the auditor who is conducting the audit or investigation. The auditor will incorporate this as correspondence relating to the audit or investigation.

An acknowledgment will be made that the disclosure has been received.

_During the first interview_  
For disclosures made during the first interview, the Inland Revenue auditor will consider whether the disclosure is complete and reveals all the relevant information necessary to ascertain the correct tax position.

#### Notification

Subsection 141G(4) provides that a taxpayer has been notified of a pending audit or investigation or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if any of the following persons have received notification:

*   the taxpayer;
*   an officer of the taxpayer;
*   a shareholder of the taxpayer (for close companies);
*   a tax advisor acting for the taxpayer;
*   a partner in a partnership;
*   a person acting for, or on behalf of, or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer.

An officer includes a director, secretary, receiver or liquidator. It does not include an employee.

_Time of notification_  
Notification will occur at the earlier of the date of receipt by the taxpayer or agent of the written advice or the time of a telephone call advising the commencement of the audit or investigation.

If the exact time of receipt of the written notice becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by section 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Any telephone call advising of an audit or investigation will be followed up by written advice as soon as possible.

_Unannounced visits_  
In the case of unannounced visits, the time of the notification will be the date of first contact with the taxpayer.

_Date an audit or investigation starts_  
Section 141G(5) states that a tax audit or investigation starts at the earlier of:

*   the end of the first interview an Inland Revenue officer has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative, after the taxpayer receives the notice; and  
      
    
*   the time when:
    *   an officer of Inland Revenue inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives notice, and
    *   the time the taxpayer is notified of the inspection

_Taxpayer's authorised representative present at interview_  
If the taxpayer does not attend the first interview but instead sends a representative, the taxpayer cannot claim the benefit of a post-notification disclosure for any additional tax shortfall revealed after the interview. This is the case even if the representative was not given any information by the taxpayer from which to make a disclosure.

_Disclosure by a subsidiary of a company_  
An audit of a parent company, or a subsidiary of that company, may necessitate the audit of other subsidiaries within the group. In such cases, disclosure would depend upon which entity had been notified. If the parent company had received notification that the audit was restricted to that entity, then any disclosure made by the subsidiary is voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit.

However, if another company in the group has been notified that the audit is being extended, any disclosure made by that other company would be considered a disclosure after notification of an audit.

When a company has a branch or branches, they are considered to have been notified at the same time as the company, as they are part of the company and not separate entities.

#### Full Disclosure

Any voluntary disclosure will initially be considered, subject to the applicable time bar, as a request for an amendment of an assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

The disclosure must be full and complete. It is not up to the Commissioner to elicit the required information from the taxpayer. This does not necessarily mean disclosing the discrepancies to the last dollar but does require providing enough information to enable the auditor, investigator or officer to make an assessment. Each case will have to be considered on its own merits.

If a taxpayer is not able to provide full details at the first point of contact with Inland Revenue, the Commissioner will allow the taxpayer reasonable time to obtain more information. The time period for obtaining this information will be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer. Once this information is provided and the disclosure is considered full and complete, the date of the voluntary disclosure will be the date of the first point of contact.

_Minimum details required_  
To satisfy full and complete disclosure, the following minimum details must be provided:

*   taxpayers details (name, trade name, IRD number, address, date of birth/incorporation, contact telephone number and contact times);
*   the nature of the errors or omissions;
*   an explanation as to why the errors or omissions occurred;
*   adequate information to enable an assessment of the tax shortfall to be made;
*   a declaration signed by the taxpayer, if possible;
*   further information as is necessary to make an assessment.

Where this information is not provided, the Commissioner will consider on a case by case basis whether the information provided is sufficient to satisfy the full and complete disclosure requirements. In doing so, the Commissioner will have regard to the taxpayer's reasons for not making the specified information available.

_More than one tax shortfall_  
Each tax shortfall is considered separately. If there is more than one tax shortfall, one being the subject of voluntary disclosure and the other being detected by an audit, the shortfall detected by the audit will not come within the voluntary disclosure regime.

If the items are identical or similar they will be treated as one tax shortfall. Therefore, for a full and complete voluntary disclosure, both items will need to be disclosed prior to the end of the first interview. If one of the items is not disclosed until after the first interview this will result in the taxpayer not satisfying the requirements of a full and complete disclosure.

_Disclosure of another tax type_  
If an audit is being carried out on one tax type and the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure regarding another tax type, and they have not been notified that the other tax type is being audited, the taxpayer will qualify for voluntary disclosure prior to notification of an audit as long as the disclosure meets all other requirements.

_Disclosure of another period_  
It is common for a notice of intention to carry out an audit to state that a particular year or period is to be audited but previous years or periods may be looked at if necessary. The year or period referred to only is examined in the first instance. If the taxpayer has not been advised that an earlier year or period is being examined, the taxpayer is able to make a pre-notification disclosure for that year or period.

_Disclosure where Inland Revenue already knows of the shortfall_  
In situations where the information provided is required by law or Inland Revenue knows there is a tax shortfall and has verification of that shortfall, the taxpayer cannot make a voluntary disclosure. An example of this is when an employer files their Employer Monthly Schedule without an accompanying payment. The employer cannot voluntarily disclose the non-payment of the PAYE as Inland Revenue will know that payment has not been made. For further information on this refer to Standard Practice Statement INV-260, Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol.12, No.2.

#### Disclosure Forms

Where possible it is desirable for the protection of both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue that disclosures be in writing and signed by the taxpayer. Voluntary disclosure form IR282A, which covers both pre-notification and post-notification disclosures, has been prepared for this purpose.

However, Inland Revenue will also accept other written disclosures and verbal disclosures without the need for the taxpayer also to complete the form.

#### Prosecution and Publication of Name

If a voluntary disclosure is full and complete:

*   Inland Revenue will not consider prosecution action for pre-notification disclosures.
*   In post-notification cases, prosecution may be considered in cases of evasion or similar offending (ie those offences listed in section 143B of the Tax Administration Act 1994).
*   There will be no publication of the taxpayer's name in the Gazette.

Promoter Penalties (Mar 04)
===========================

INV-290 provides information about applying promoter penalties to promoters of arrangements involving abusive tax positions.

Introduction
------------

1.  This Standard Practice Statement sets out the Commissioner's practice for applying promoter penalties to promoters of arrangements involving abusive tax positions.

Application
-----------

2.  This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 April 2004 to arrangements entered into on and after 26 March 2003.  
      
    
3.  This Standard Practice Statement must be read in conjunction with the Standard Practice Statements setting out the Commissioner's practice on imposing and reducing shortfall penalties and taking prosecutions.

Background
----------

4.  The discussion document _Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review_ (August 2001) identified a number of concerns with the application of the shortfall penalties legislation to investors in tax avoidance arrangements. One concern was that in many cases investors in such arrangements are not aware of the tax effects of their investment. Another concern was that the abusive tax position shortfall penalty, which is intended to be applied to taxpayers who are not complying, was, in some cases, being applied to taxpayers who thought that they were complying but were, in fact, misled by the promoters.  
      
    
5.  Where a taxpayer is a party to an arrangement that results in the taxpayer taking an abusive tax position, a shortfall penalty is imposed on the taxpayer. Although the compliance and penalties legislation penalised promoters in their capacity as taxpayers, the legislation imposed no civil sanctions on promoters in their capacity as promoters of arrangements. The compliance and penalties legislation therefore provided no extra incentive for promoters to ensure that the tax effects they claim for their arrangements were correct. Furthermore, offer documents and securities law in some cases restrict taxpayers from taking legal action against the promoter.  
      
    
6.  The review considered two principal options, namely increasing the taxpayer's penalty or imposing a new penalty on promoters. The government considered that promoters of such arrangements should be held clearly accountable for their actions. The promoter is usually the party with the greater knowledge of the arrangement's tax effects. Often, the true tax impact of an arrangement may be determined by features that the promoter is aware of but the investor is not. These undisclosed features may place the investor at risk of significant penalties.  
      
    
7.  The following amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 give effect to the recommendations outlined in the discussion document _Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review_ including that a promoter may be liable to a penalty in their capacity as promoter.  
      
    
8.  In addition to the following amendments, the legislation provides that in certain circumstances the previous behaviour of a taxpayer may entitle the taxpayer to a reduction of any shortfall penalties.

Discussion
----------

_The promoter_

9.  New sections 141EB and 141EC have been inserted to provide for the imposition of a civil penalty on promoters, in cases where investment in an arrangement leads to any investor having a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position imposed.  
      
    
10.  If an arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to ten or more people in an income year and it involves an abusive tax position, the promoter will be liable for a promoter penalty. The penalty will be the sum of the tax shortfalls resulting from the arrangement. The penalty is aimed at reducing the number of such investments by holding the people responsible for the design and sale of tax arrangements directly accountable for their actions.  
      
    
11.  Under section 141EB(4)(c) the penalty is based on the maximum taxation-related benefits that the arrangement would produce. This means, for example, that if the arrangement was based around income tax, the tax rate used to calculate the promoter penalty would be 39 cents in the dollar as that rate produces the maximum tax-related benefit, or if the arrangement involves a GST transaction the rate used to determine the promoter penalty would be 12.5%.

_Independent advice - reduction of investor's shortfall penalty_

12.  Although not intended to impose a significant burden on an investor, there is an obligation on investors (and their advisors) to consider the tax issues involved with an arrangement before an investor can qualify for a reduction of the abusive tax position penalty from 100% to 20%.  
      
    
13.  The Tax Administration Act 1994 requires investors to have had the advantage of independent advice that the tax position resulting from the investment is not an abusive tax position.

_Definitions_

14.  "Arrangement" - for the purposes of the promoter penalty, "arrangement" means a contract, agreement, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect.  
      
    
15.  "Promoter" - the definition of "promoter" in section 141EC includes:  
      
    
    *   a person who is a party to, or is **significantly** involved in formulating, a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered; or  
          
        
    *   a person who is **aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement** and who sells, issues, or promotes the selling or issuing of, the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration.
    
      
      
    
16.  "Promoted" - is not defined, however, from the definitions of "promoter" contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Securities Act 1978, promoted would generally include the selling or issuing, or arranging the selling or issuing, of the arrangement.  
      
    
17.  "Offered" - is not defined in the Inland Revenue Acts, however, the definition of "offer" in the Securities Act 1978 includes an invitation, and any proposal or invitation to make an offer (for example advertisements). Case law [\[1\]](#1)
     has given this a broader definition than "offer" as used in contract law.  
      
    
18.  "Issued" - is not defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Generally it will take on the same meaning as under Securities law.  
      
    
19.  "Tax-related benefits as a result of the arrangement" - is not defined, however such benefits could include tax deductions, tax losses, input tax credits, and deferred output tax. Benefits may arise from timing advantages or claiming deductions of a private or capital nature.

Standard Practice
-----------------

20.  This Standard Practice details the following:
    *   the criteria
    *   promoter
    *   offered, sold, issued or promoted
    *   calculating the penalty
    *   multiple promoters
    *   imposition of a promoter penalty
    *   disputable decision
    *   independent advice - reduction of investor's penalty
    *   previous behaviour - reduction of penalties.

_The criteria_

21.  A promoter is liable for a promoter penalty when the following criteria are met:
    *   there is a promoter as defined
    *   there is an arrangement as defined
    *   a taxpayer becomes a party to the arrangement
    *   a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position is imposed on a participant as a result of the arrangement the arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to 10 or more persons in an income year.

_Promoter_

22.  A promoter of an arrangement includes a person (individual or non-individual) who is a party to or who is significantly involved in formulating a plan or programme. Whether or not a person is a party or significantly involved is largely a matter of fact. It is necessary to consider a number of factors including:
    
    *   the flow of money/profits
    *   input into the design of the arrangement
    *   level of knowledge
    *   documents
    *   advertising/promotional material.
    
      
      
    
23.  Generally this will require knowledge of the key features of the arrangement, or contractual or similar involvement. However it may also apply to directors of companies, or key professional advisors (whose roles are not limited to providing legal, accounting, clerical or secretarial services to promoters), involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered.

**Example 1** [\[2\]](#1)
  
An accountant in private practice works closely with an entrepreneur to design a scheme and prepare offer documents. The entrepreneur offers an arrangement to at least 10 people who claim tax-related benefits. The knowledge and role of the accountant would indicate that they were significantly involved in formulating a plan. Accordingly they would be considered to be a promoter for the purposes of the promoter penalty provisions. Other factors to consider may be whether the financial advisor is paid for their services or receive a share of the proceeds.

24.  The person's involvement needs to be other than in a professional or administrative capacity on behalf of another person who is a promoter.  
      
    
25.  A promoter also includes a person who is aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement and who sells, issues, or promotes the selling or issuing of, the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration. This is also a question of fact and would involve looking at the relevant factors set out above. This would for instance, include persons aware of material and relevant aspects of a scheme who actively market the scheme to their clients, for example financial advisors.

**Example 2**  
Following on from Example 1, a financial advisor, who was not involved in formulating the plan, offers an arrangement to their clients. The financial advisor, who is aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement, is considered to be a promoter for the purposes of the promoter penalty provisions. Whether or not the financial advisor received remuneration is not relevant.

_Offered, sold, issued or promoted_

26.  One of the criteria for liability for the promoter penalty is that the arrangement has been offered, sold, issued or promoted to 10 or more persons in an income year.  
      
    
27.  This criterion is deemed to be met when 10 or more persons claim tax-related benefits as a result of the arrangement. Such benefits could include tax deductions, tax losses, input tax credits, and deferred output tax.

**Example 3**  
If an investigation identifies 10 taxpayers who each claimed, as a result of a particular tax avoidance arrangement, a deduction for a share of partnership losses, then the arrangement is deemed to be offered, sold, issued or promoted to 10 or more persons in an income year.

28.  When determining whether an arrangement has been offered, sold, issued or promoted to 10 or more persons, each shareholder of a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) and each partner of a partnership is counted, if the arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to the loss attributing qualifying company or the partnership.

**Example 4  
**An arrangement is offered to a LAQC with 3 shareholders, and another company with 6 shareholders. That will count as an offer to 4 persons - 3 through the LAQC and 1 for the other company.

29.  It is the Commissioner's view that whether in fact an arrangement has been offered to 10 or more persons is measured by reference to such things as attendance at promotional events, records of correspondence held by the promoter and other objective means. Imposition of the promoter penalty is not limited to circumstances in which 10 or more persons claim tax-related benefits.  
      
    
30.  Arrangements advertised in the general media will be considered to be offered to 10 or more persons - regardless of how many invest in the arrangement.  
      
    
31.  In general, the Commissioner will apply principles derived from the Securities Act 1978 when considering whether an arrangement has been offered or promoted.

_Calculating the promoter penalty_

32.  The penalty on the promoter is determined by reference to the total tax shortfalls resulting from the arrangement. This ensures that the promoter faces a penalty that reflects the total tax impact of the arrangement and is calculated from the maximum taxation-related benefits (shortfalls) that each investor in the arrangement would have obtained. Add those taxation-related benefits together to calculate the penalty on the promoter.  
      
    
33.  If the arrangement was based around income tax, the tax rate used to calculate the promoter penalty is 39 cents in the dollar, as that rate produces the maximum tax-related benefit.  
      
    
34.  If the arrangement involves a GST transaction, the rate used to determine the promoter penalty would be 12.5%.

**Example 5  
**A promoter sells an arrangement to 11 investors designed to give them a deduction of $30,000 each. Using the maximum income tax rate of 39%, the sum of these maximum taxation-benefits is 11 x $11,700 which totals $128,700. Accordingly, the amount of the promoter penalty is $128,700.

_Multiple promoters_

35.  There may be more than one promoter associated with an arrangement, and the promoters may have differing levels of involvement with the arrangement. In order to determine the extent of the liability of each promoter it is necessary to determine whether each promoter of an arrangement is:
    
    1.  a party to or significantly involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered; or
    2.  aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement and who sells, issues, or promotes the selling or issuing of, the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration.
    
    The extent of the promoter's liability will depend on which of these two categories applies to the promoter.  
      
    
36.  Each promoter that is a party to or significantly involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered is jointly and severally liable with the other promoters for the whole promoter penalty.  
      
    
37.  Where there is more than one promoter, each promoter who is not a party to or significantly involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered, but is:
    1.  aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement; and
    2.  sells, issues or promotes the selling or issuing of the arrangement,is jointly and severally liable, with the other promoters, for the portion of the promoter penalty associated with the arrangement entered into by taxpayers to whom the promoter offered, sold, issued or promoted the arrangement.

_Imposition of a promoter penalty_

38.  Promoter penalties are imposed in addition to shortfall penalties. The promoter penalty is imposed in tandem with the shortfall penalty where the promoter is subject to a shortfall (as an investor in the arrangement) - but if further shortfalls are detected, further penalties will be imposed.  
      
    
39.  Investors remain liable for shortfall penalties when a promoter penalty is imposed on a promoter.  
      
    
40.  Other than where an exclusion applies under section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner will first propose any promoter penalty in a NOPA (Notice of Proposed Adjustment).

_Disputable decision_

41.  The imposition of a promoter penalty is a disputable decision and, as such, can be disputed in accordance with the disputes procedures provisions in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

_Independent advice - reduction of investor's shortfall penalty_

42.  The abusive tax shortfall penalty on the investor will be imposed at 20% rather than 100% where:
    
    *   the tax shortfalls of the investor and any associated person are less than $50,000; and
    *   the investor has independent advice stating that the investor's tax position is not an abusive tax position.
    
      
      
    
43.  The advice must state more than just facts - it must express an opinion and must state that the investor's tax position is not an abusive tax position. Statements by the promoter will not be sufficient.  
      
    
44.  Generally, advice will be independent when:
    
    *   an investor receives the advice, for example in promotional material or a legal opinion
    *   an investor, or a promoter on behalf of investors, paid for professional advice that the arrangement is not an abusive tax position
    *   the advice expressly states that it was prepared on the basis that it would be given to the investors
    *   the advisor is independent of the promoter; and
    *   the advisor is not a promoter.
    
      
      
    
45.  The advice must be genuinely identifiable as coming from someone independent of both the taxpayer and the promoter. When determining whether advice is independent, the Commissioner will consider:
    *   any relationship between an investor and an advisor
    *   any relationship between a promoter and an advisor; and/or
    *   the information available to an investor regarding any relationship between a promoter and an advisor.

_Previous behaviour - reduction of penalties_

46.  A taxpayer (i.e. an investor including a promoter who is also an investor) may be eligible to have their abusive tax position shortfall penalty reduced for previous behaviour in certain circumstances. If it is, then such a reduction will be available in addition to any other applicable reduction.  
      
    
47.  Note that the promoter penalty cannot be reduced under section 141FB which reduces shortfall penalties on the grounds of previous behaviour.

Acceptance of late objections under section 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Mar 97) (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================================================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-300-Acceptance of late objections under s 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (1997). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

_\[This standard practice statement applies only to objections lodged under the disputes resolution regime existing prior to **1 October 1996.**  For objections under the new disputes resolution regime, refer to Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, Number 3.  (The new process in relation to child support applies only to deductions from liable persons)\]_

Summary
-------

This statement sets out Inland Revenue's policy on the acceptance of late objections to assessments (or to determinations or decisions, if applicable) under:

*   Section 126(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (previously section 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976).  
      
    
*   Section 33(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.  
      
    
*   Section 72(2) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.  
      
    
*   Section 90(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.  
      
    
*   Section 12I of the Gaming Duties Act 1971.  
      
    
*   Section 73(2) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992.  
      
    
*   Section 92(2) of the Child Support Act 1991.

For the purposes of this statement, "taxpayer" includes "liable person" and "custodial parent" under the Child Support Act.

Background
----------

Inland Revenue has reviewed it's policy on the acceptance of late objections following the Court of Appeal judgement in **C of IR v Wilson** (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512.

Inland Revenue's policy on the acceptance of late objections to tax assessments was previously set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 1, Number 5 (November 1989).  That policy was set following the High Court decision of **Gisborne Mills Limited and others v C of IR** (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194.

**Amended policy - Reopening of assessments or acceptance of late objections where a decision of a Court or Taxation Review Authority results in a change in the interpretation of the law**

This policy replaces all previous statements.

The Court of Appeal in Wilson considered it impossible to lay down absolute rules as to what factors will always be relevant to the determination of a late objection request.  The Court however in effect, did suggest a Two Step approach in considering requests. In summary, the first step is to consider the taxpayer's explanation for the lateness of the objection. A reasonable explanation is all that is required at this stage. The second step is to consider all the surrounding circumstances and decide whether, as a matter of fairness, the application should be allowed.

The steps are:

_Step 1_

Consider the explanation given by the taxpayer for failure to make a timely objection.  Where there is significant delay involved, the reasons for the failure to make the application earlier may be a factor to be considered.

Depending on the circumstances, it may be relevant to consider whether the failure to object in time was due to inadvertence, negligence, an agent's action or deliberate decision of the taxpayer.  These factors may weigh against the taxpayer.

A reasonable explanation to explain the delay is all that is required at this point.  For example, where the delay was caused by:

*   the ill health of the taxpayer, or  
      
    
*   other circumstances beyond their control, such as the taxpayer being overseas during the whole of the two month objection period and there were no arrangements in place to receive and deal with notices of assessment,

this will generally be sufficient to satisfy step 1.

If there is some merit in the explanation given, (that is, it provides reasonable justification for the failure to object in time), the application will be considered further in accordance with step 2.

If however, the explanation is inadequate, the application can be rejected making it unnecessary to proceed to step 2.

The details and grounds of the late objection must be given at the same time as the explanation for the delay.

_Step 2_

The general thrust of the policy remains unchanged from that set out in the Tax Information Bulletin Volume 1, Number 5. The Commissioner is to consider all the circumstances surrounding the application to decide whether, as a matter of fairness, the application should be allowed.

The circumstances to be considered may duplicate those considered in step 1 (reasons for the delay in making the late objection). The task at step 2 is to determine whether, in the light of all the circumstances, and as a matter of fairness, the application should be allowed.  Inland Revenue views step 1 as a means of screening applications, identifying those without merit due to an inadequate explanation for the delay, and rejecting them without further consideration.

An important aspect of the Court of Appeal's judgement is that obtaining a correct assessment is not the paramount consideration in deciding whether to accept a late objection.

A number of factors have been identified (either from Court decisions or previous policy) as potentially relevant in this regard.  These are set out in Appendix A

Late objection in circumstances other than a change in interpretation of the law
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   _Claims where there is clear entitlement_  
      
    Where there is an entitlement that is clearly apparent on the face of the claim, an amendment can be made under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 following the policy set out in Appendix B.  
      
    
*   _Other claims_  
      
    If the entitlement is established only after further investigation or consideration of the claim (and the entitlement does not rely on a subsequent change in interpretation of the law), the procedures set out in steps 1 and 2 above will need to be followed. A liberal approach should be taken when considering such claims.

Weighting of factors
--------------------

The weight to be given to the factors which are taken into account in deciding whether or not to accept a late objection, is to be decided by the Commissioner on the circumstances of each case.

Recording the decision
----------------------

It is important that the factors taken into account in deciding whether or not to accept a late objection be adequately documented.

A convenient way to make the decision is for a staff member to prepare a detailed memorandum addressed to the person who will be making the decision. This memorandum will set out the factors which they have taken into account, the weight to be applied to each factor and the reasons for the recommendation.

The person making the decision is to include their comments including their reasoning and the resulting decision.

Where judicial review proceedings arise, evidence of the decision making process will need to be produced to Court. If the factors taken into account and the reasons for making the decision are recorded at the time, it will improve the evidence which can be produced to the Court.

Who can accept late objections
------------------------------

Team Leaders and above can decide whether or not to accept late objections. However, if the late objection seeks to take advantage of a subsequent Court decision, the decision is to be made by:

*   Area Managers  
      
    
*   Managers Technical and Legal Support Group  
      
    
*   Managers Corporates

Consideration of the objection
------------------------------

If it is decided to accept the late objection, the objection must then be considered on its merits in detail.

Conclusion
----------

The factors set out in Appendix A are guidelines and must not be applied in a rigid or inflexible manner. They are at all times subject to the overall issue of fairness. In each situation, the particular weight to be applied to the factors considered is to be determined by the Commissioner. Each case must be considered on it's own merits.  Queries can be directed to Paul Skinner, Operations Policy, National Office. DDI (04) 802-6115 or facsimile (04) 802-6100.

APPENDIX A
----------

FACTORS WHICH MAY BE RELEVANT IN CONSIDERING A LATE OBJECTION REQUEST (TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER "STEP 2" OF THE PROCESS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some factors which support acceptance of the late objection are:

*   If the proposed objection has apparent merit.  (This is a factor which was not considered under the previous policy, but in the light of Wilson it is now a factor). This may and often will be a relevant factor. This can only be assessed on the material before the Commissioner when asked to accept a late objection and need not be investigated to the point of allowance or disallowance. It will not usually be necessary for the Department to make further enquiry to determine the merits in order to make a decision. In some cases however, a moments check may show that the quantification of liability in the assessment was erroneous.  
      
    
*   If the objector had consistently asserted their entitlement and only failed to lodge an objection due to the Commissioner's insistence that the entitlement was not available to them.  
      
    
*   If the taxpayers are part of a consortium who have been involved in the case in an informal way (including, for example, financial contributions) and who have believed that their own case would be reconsidered following the test case.  
      
    
*   If there are no practical or administrative difficulties in considering the situation at that time (e.g. they are part of a readily identifiable group, the evidence is immediately available and no practical obstacles exist to its application).  
      
    
*   If the taxpayers have been told that a "test case" would apply to them.  
      
    
*   When assessment notice sent to the taxpayer's home and taxpayer temporarily away during the objection period.  
      
    
*   The serious ill health or death of agent, or agent's office shut for annual holidays.  
      
    
*   When granting the relief requested would not violate the Commissioner's responsibility to be even handed.  
      
    
*   When the taxpayer is seeking legal or other professional advice.  
      
    
*   When the taxpayer is ignorant of procedures to follow.  
      
    
*   When the taxpayer has fallen ill.

Some factors which support declining a late objection are:

*   If a taxpayer has a professional tax adviser Inland Revenue may be reluctant to accept a late objection as agents should generally be aware of the legislative requirements. Omitting to lodge an objection because of an oversight by the taxpayer or agent (or agent's staff) will usually not constitute satisfactory grounds.  
      
    
*   The extent to which an objection is late and any history of making late objections by either the taxpayer or agent.  
      
    
*   The Commissioner would not be required to exercise discretion where the taxpayer had never contemplated seeking a benefit but had endeavoured to take advantage of a subsequent change in the interpretation of the law, such as by way of a subsequent court decision or issue of a standard practice statement.

All circumstances are to be considered. The above factors are guidelines only and are not exhaustive. They are not intended to restrict the discretion given to the Commissioner. Decision makers should always remain open to the possibility of new factors arising in any case that may make it unfair not to accept the objection.

APPENDIX B
----------

LATE OBJECTIONS AND AMENDMENT OF ASSESSMENTS UNDER SECTION 113 OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the past it has been Inland Revenue's policy to treat any request by the taxpayer concerned to reopen an assessment as a late objection. In some circumstances however, an amendment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 23 of the Income Tax Act 1976) is the correct means for dealing with such matters. An amendment under this provision is appropriate (even if it has resulted from a request by the taxpayer concerned) where the error in the assessment is apparent on the face of the claim itself. For example, arithmetical errors or unclaimed rebates; claims which, had they been made at the appropriate time, would have been accepted without further consideration.

Note that there may be rare circumstances where the discretion to amend under section 113 is not exercised even with such claims as these, for example excessive and unexplained delay.

However, if there is any doubt as to the entitlement claimed (or liability disclosed) by the taxpayer, an amendment under section 113 is **not** appropriate. In these circumstances the matter should be considered under the objection procedure of section 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 30 of the Income Tax Act 1976). This procedure has the role of examining the merit of claims and accordingly is the appropriate mechanism where any consideration of the correctness of the claim is necessary.

Circumstances where a request to reopen an assessment are properly considered under the objection procedure are where:

*   The claim would be disallowed under existing policy.  
      
    
*   The merit of the claim needs to be examined.  
      
    
*   Further matters need to be examined to substantiate the claim; for example, if there is any factual uncertainty, or any claim by the taxpayer of their intention which the Commissioner may wish to verify.  
      
    
*   Where it appears the taxpayer may be endeavouring to take advantage of a change in policy or a decision affecting another taxpayer, when they had never contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation at the appropriate time.

If the request to reopen is made late, it will be necessary to consider whether the request should be accepted in accordance with the "late objection policy".

Situations may arise where a request to reopen an assessment requires the use of both, that is sections 113 and 126. For example, a request may arise for an unclaimed rebate or admission of undisclosed income which could give rise to a section 113 amendment. The same request or admission may ask for the late acceptance of a share loss objection requiring consideration under section 126. In these circumstances, the policy will need to be applied separately to the different elements of the request.

The above also applies to equivalent provisions in other Inland Revenue Acts:

*   Goods and Services Tax Act - sections 27(2) and 33  
      
    
*   Estate and Gift Duties Act - sections 49(3), 82(2) and 90(2)  
      
    
*   Gaming Duties Act - section 12G(2) and 12I  
      
    
*   Child Support Act - sections 87 and 92.

Section 17 notices (Oct 99) (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================

Withdrawn INV-321 Section 17 notices (Oct 99). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This standard practice statement outlines the procedures Inland Revenue will follow when issuing section 17 notices, and third party information request letters, pursuant to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). Appendix A provides copies of the section 17 notices, and third party information request letter, used.

This standard practice statement is effective from 1 October 1999.

Generally, where information is publicly available Inland Revenue will not use section 17 and will meet the usual charges, e.g. Land Transfer Office, Companies Office, Quotable Value New Zealand etc.

Background
----------

Section 17 of the TAA is the legislative authority enabling Inland Revenue to require information and inspect books and documents.

Most taxpayers and third parties are willing to cooperate with Inland Revenue requests for information.  Some taxpayers, such as banks, while they are willing to cooperate with Inland Revenue, require legal compulsion before they can properly divulge the information.  Therefore, it is Inland Revenue practice when initially requesting information, books or documents either not to rely upon the section, or to simply state that the request is made in terms of section 17, e.g. to a bank where the request is made about one of their clients.

The reason for this practice is to foster a spirit of fairness, reasonableness, and mutual co-operation with taxpayers and third parties in their dealings with Inland Revenue.  This is considered more appropriate than proceeding from the outset with a section 17 notice that refers to the statutory remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the notice.  This response is also preferred by the major suppliers of information.

The section 17 notice makes reference to statutory consequences of non-compliance and includes a copy of section 17 in full.  If not complied with, a section 17 notice will result in Inland Revenue invoking the statutory remedies as the next step in obtaining the information being sought.

Considerations when issuing section 17 notices
----------------------------------------------

Inland Revenue will have considered the following prior to issuing section 17 notices:

*   the reason for requiring the information - the request will be bona fide, and the information required will be necessary, or relevant;
*   the impact of the request on the suppliers of information - Inland Revenue will be reasonable in relation to the quantity and/or timeliness for providing the information where there is genuine difficulty in obtaining and/or providing that information;
*   the disputes resolution process - this process relies on full and prompt disclosure by both the Commissioner and the disputant; and
*   the intention to ensure compliance with the notice - Inland Revenue will invoke the statutory remedies in the event of non-compliance.

Procedures
----------

Generally, a section 17 notice will only be issued following a failure to provide information previously requested, or where specific issues have been identified and an attempt to resolve those issues has failed.  Where it is considered necessary to issue a section 17 notice Inland Revenue will use the following procedures:

1.  where an investigation is stalled by non-supply of information (refer notice "A") or, has identified specific issues requiring resolution (refer notice "B") a section 17 notice may be issued.  The timing of issue will be determined on a case by case basis;  
      
    
2.  where the taxpayer or other entity contacts Inland Revenue and modification of the notice is agreed it will be recorded in writing (refer notice "C");  
      
    
3.  where Inland Revenue considers a taxpayer has not complied with a section 17 notice an application for a court order, for compliance with the section 17 notice, may be made.  Prosecution action may also be taken;  
      
    
4.  where non-compliance occurs a follow up notice will be issued stating that the section 17 notice has not been complied with, court orders are being sought and/or prosecution action is being considered (refer notice "D"); and  
      
    
5.  where prosecution action is taken it may be in tandem with, before or after, seeking a court order, but will not be prior to the issue of a follow up notice (refer notice "D").  Where compliance occurs subsequent to the issue of a follow up notice prosecution action may still proceed, e.g. where a pattern of late response emerges.

In following the above process every attempt will be made to maintain contact with the taxpayer so as to provide an opportunity for concerns to be raised.

Where requests are made to persons other than the taxpayer the procedure usually begins with a letter (refer letter "E").  It may follow a discussion.  Where this request is not complied with the above process, to obtain the information, is commenced.

**Note:**  
Inland Revenue will not reissue section 17 notices in a different format.  Once a section 17 notice has not been complied with the offence is committed and prosecution action, if taken, must be commenced within 6 months of the offence.

Standard Wording of Notices and Letters
---------------------------------------

The following minimum content will be included in letters and section 17 notices:

*   The notice/letter will be typed on Inland Revenue letterhead.  In cases where it is faxed it will still be on letterhead;  
      
    
*   A section 17 notice will include (refer notices "A" and "B");
    
    1.  a brief background to the requisition
    2.  a statement as to why the requisition is made
    3.  reference to the legal authority for collecting the information
    4.  a statement that the information required is considered necessary or relevant for a proper purpose
    5.  a statement that is as specific as the circumstances allow,
    6.  an address, time and date for collection which is reasonable relative to the information type and background to the requisition
    7.  an offer of assistance or flexibility to enable compliance (i.e. to modify, collection time, collection place, collection date, requisition content) \[Note: any change to the date for compliance must be agreed before expiration of the original date.  Beyond this a breach has occurred and an extension of time cannot be given\]
    8.  a reference to the possible consequences of non-compliance including any defence available
    9.  the date of issue of the notice and a copy of section 17, and
    10.  signature and position of officer of Inland Revenue.
    
      
    
*   The notice may also include;
    
    1.  an additional request for identification of items, if any, for which legal privilege is claimed, and
    2.  a requirement that any written information or particulars furnished be verified by statutory declaration.
    
      
    
*   A follow up notice will include;
    
    1.  a statement that to Inland Revenue's knowledge compliance has not occurred
    2.  a statement as to the actions being considered
    3.  a list of offences committed
    4.  an indication of the maximum penalties applicable to each offence, and
    5.  copies of the offence sections including any defence section \[i.e. section 143(2), section 143A(2)\].
    
      
    
*   The first request to a person other than the taxpayer will refer to section 17 and include a date by which compliance should occur (refer letter "E").  This letter is not to be use to request information that is publicly available.

This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 1 October 1999.

Tape recording Inland Revenue interviews (May 00) (WITHDRAWN)
=============================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS INV-330-Tape recording Inland Revenue interviews. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

In keeping with its efforts to streamline its activities by using technology, Inland Revenue has been conducting some of its interviews using audio recording rather than the traditional method of taking hand written notes.  This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) outlines Inland Revenue's standard practice when audio taping an interview.

Interviews can range from general information exchanges where Inland Revenue will gather information to enable resolution of queries, through to formal interview situations where a line of enquiry has potential for litigation.

Generally, interviewees will be advised of the intention to tape-record interviews by Inland Revenue when arranging interviews.  Occasions may arise where, after having arranged an interview, Inland Revenue may seek to tape-record and interviewees will be advised prior to the commencement of the interview.  Where interviews are voluntary, Inland Revenue will respect interviewees decisions to decline tape-recording of discussion.

Statements made during recorded interviews may be admissible as evidence, and in this respect it is important that the interviews are carried out fairly to the person being interviewed.  Admissibility will however, be subject to the normal rules of evidence applicable to the presiding Court.

Before going into the general detail of Inland Revenue practice when taping interviews, it is opportune to reflect on why the SPS has been developed.

Over recent years, Inland Revenue has used tape recorders at various interviews simply for ease of providing a complete record of discussion between parties.  This has ranged from the use of Dictaphones through to the use of triple deck recorders, depending on the needs of the parties and the types of interviews.

It now seems appropriate to establish a standard practice which is able to be applied across a variety of interview situations where tape recorders might reasonably be used.  The simple use of technology to record (generally by consensus) interview situations does not result in any significant change to current Inland Revenue practice.

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement applies from 1 June 2000.

This SPS will not apply to an independent contractor who is conducting an interview on behalf of Inland Revenue, for example a research company contracted to carry out a customer satisfaction survey or an external solicitor under contract to carry out a Child Support review.

Advantages
----------

Recording interviews in audio format is now a common practice by investigative agencies and there are advantages for both Inland Revenue staff and the person being interviewed in audio recording.

*   The interview will take less time than is the case when hand written notes are taken.
*   There is an exact record of what was said at the interview by both the interviewee and the Inland Revenue Officer conducting the interview.
*   Tape-recording provides far greater clarity of content of what is said and the inferences from it.
*   The Inland Revenue staff member and the interviewee can concentrate fully on the interview instead of there being a delay in taking full notes.
*   There will be a copy of the taped interview available to the interviewee.
*   If Inland Revenue transcribes the tape a full copy is available for the interviewee after transcription.

Standard Practice
-----------------

_When to tape interviews_

Tape recording may be deemed necessary if:

*   The tax affairs to which the interview relates are complex.
*   There are numerous facts to be gathered.
*   There are inconsistencies in the interviewee's explanations to date.
*   The relationship between the interviewee and Inland Revenue has deteriorated and objectivity needs to be restored.  Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds for considering legal proceedings may be taken involving the interviewee or some other taxpayer.  Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds for considering that the interviewee may provide important information in circumstances where the interviewee's or another taxpayer's purpose or intention is relevant e.g. in relation to avoidance.
*   The interviewee requests that the interview be recorded.

However, these are examples only and the decision by Inland Revenue staff to tape-record an interview is not limited to these situations.

An interviewee may request that an interview be recorded using the audio monitor equipment.  Such requests must be made prior to the interview and will be subject to the availability of Inland Revenue's recording equipment.

In most cases, the interviewee will be advised prior to attending the interview that the intention is to record the interview.

### CONSENT

_Consent_

Where an interviewee is attending an interview voluntarily the interview will only be recorded with the consent and co-operation of the interviewee.

Attendance at an inquiry by the Commissioner under section 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is compulsory.  All interviews carried out under this section will be tape-recorded.  The interviewee can not decline the tape-recording of interviews carried out under this section.

There will not be any secret tape-recording of interviews.  To minimise the possibility of accusations of secret recording the interviewee's acknowledgement that the interview is being taped will also be recorded during the interview.

_Equipment_

When Inland Revenue intends to record interviews, Inland Revenue will provide the audio equipment; this will be general practice whether interviews are held at an Inland Revenue office or elsewhere.  New tape cassettes should be used for each interview.

The audio monitoring equipment used to record interviews may vary between Inland Revenue offices.  Interviews may be taped on any equipment as long as the recording equipment records the interview clearly and all the participants can be heard and are distinguishable on the tape.

Inland Revenue may use equipment that produces one, two or three copies of the taped interview.

1.  _Master Copy_  
      
    Where Inland Revenue uses recording equipment that produces three copies of the taped interview one copy will become the master tape. This cassette will be removed from the recorder and sealed at the conclusion of the interview while the interviewee is still present.  It will be stored in a secure place in the Inland Revenue office.  It will remain sealed until such time as it may be required for evidential purposes.  
      
    
2.  _Interviewee's Copy_  
      
    If a two or three tape cassette recorder is used the interviewee will be given one of the cassettes immediately after the interview to keep for his/her own purposes.  
    If a single deck recorder is used and the interviewee requests a copy of the interview then Inland Revenue will make another copy as soon as possible after the interview and give it to the interviewee.  
      
    
3.  _Working Copy_  
      
    The working copy of the tape becomes part of the investigation records and is used for any other purposes as required.  Inland Revenue will usually copy the working copy and use this version to work with.  If it should get lost or destroyed another copy can be made from the original working copy.

_Labelling of cassettes_

Each cassette and its cover (where no cover is available, a sealed bag or envelope will be used) will have an adhesive label affixed on which should be written:

*   Interviewee's name
*   Interviewer's name
*   Date of interview

Finalising agreements in tax investigations (Aug 98) (WITHDRAWN)
================================================================

Withdrawn INV-350-Finalising agreements in tax investigations (Aug 98). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Summary
-------

This standard practice statement sets out the principles and parameters for finalising agreements in tax investigations.

Final agreements must be in accordance with the law. Agreements cannot be finalised based on "splitting the difference" on a global basis. All agreements must be on an issue by issue basis based on the law and the evidence available. Once signed, the agreement precludes the taxpayer from using the disputes process in relation to the issues finalised.

This standard practice statement does not cover relief in cases of serious hardship or financial hardship as provided for by sections 176 and 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This standard practice statement applies to all staff who complete tax investigations, e.g. Corporates, BusinessLink, BusinessDirect, Personal Customer Services, RADC, Duties.

Background
----------

For a number of years the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has had a practice of resolving disputes arising from tax investigations through the process of reaching resolution.

It is essential for Inland Revenue, its staff and taxpayers that a code of good practice in relation to final agreements be defined.  This standard practice statement ensures that taxpayers are uniformly treated when entering into discussions/negotiations with Inland Revenue.

These guidelines apply to finalising agreements for disputes in respect of all the Inland Revenue Acts.  The principal focus is on the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.  These comments, with the necessary modification, apply equally to the other Inland Revenue Acts.

Legal authority for finalising agreements in tax investigations
---------------------------------------------------------------

As already stated all agreements must be on a principled basis.  Therefore assessments arising from final agreements are no different from tax assessments issued in other circumstances.

On many occasions the New Zealand Courts have stated that the Commissioner merely acts in the quantification of tax due, and it is the taxing Acts which charge tax. The Commissioner has a duty to assess the tax properly payable within the terms of the statutory framework, and in carrying out that duty the Commissioner must be completely impartial.  All assessments arising from final agreements must conform to the relevant Inland Revenue Act.

Finalising an agreement
-----------------------

The final agreement with a taxpayer represents an agreement on the relevant facts and the application of the law to those facts.  The process of finalising an agreement is one that will occur on an issue by issue basis.  Finalising an agreement is not to be seen as a process of bargaining between the parties where issues are traded off against each other.  The Commissioner will consider representations from the taxpayer, or adviser, on the relevant issues in the dispute and these will be resolved on their individual merit.

It must be remembered that not all disputes will result in a final agreement being reached.  Where agreement is not reached the disputes resolution process will apply.

Fundamentals of the agreement
-----------------------------

The process of reaching a final agreement through negotiation is one that should occur on an issue by issue basis.

It is important to recognise that the final agreement will need to be based on an assessment that conforms to the legislation.  As the Commissioner is under a statutory obligation to assess and collect the correct amount of tax, it is inappropriate that the risks of litigation be factored into the final agreement.  While litigation risk is an appropriate consideration in terms of commercial agreements, it is not appropriate in the context of finalising an agreement of taxation disputes.  If the law is uncertain and there is only a 50/50 chance of the Courts taking one view or the other, it is not possible to simply give a taxpayer one-half of the advantage or disadvantage in recognition of the uncertainty.  Agreements are based on the same statutory criteria as that for making other assessments.  The process of final agreements should not be regarded as an opportunity for issuing an assessment that does not conform to the legislation.

There are circumstances or situations where Inland Revenue will not enter into negotiations.  These are:

*   not assessing an amount which is clearly assessable, or allowing a deduction, rebate or credit that is clearly not allowable.  
      
    
*   where Inland Revenue's view of the law on a particular issue is firm (e.g. as stated through the Courts, or Inland Revenue's legal opinion is in agreement with the treatment of the issue) and this view is supported by the evidence.  
      
    
*   penalties and/or prosecution action.  
      
    
*   where an adjustment can be made only on an "all or nothing basis", that is, either an adjustment would be made for the total amount in question (the quantum of which may or may not be capable of precise computation) or no adjustment is made at all.  For example, the assessability of a transaction may depend solely on such concepts as whether the taxpayer is carrying on a business or there was a profit making purpose.  Generally speaking, on the facts, the taxpayer either satisfies the criteria for assessability of income or the taxpayer is not liable for tax in respect of that transaction.

Circumstances or situations where Inland Revenue may enter into negotiations are:

*   where the quantum of a disputed amount depends on the facts.  For example, a claim at law may be subject to apportionment and there could be doubt as to the correct position to be allowed (e.g. how much is business (deductible) and how much is private (non-deductible)).  
      
    
*   when an adjustment may rely on a question of valuation for which there are competing bases.  For example, in the determination of an arm's length transaction for GST purposes.  
      
    
*   when an item may not be subject to precise computation.  For example in the estimation of living expenses in an asset accretion assessment.  
      
    
*   where an issue of quantum or valuation has been resolved for one period and is likely to apply to prior periods.

In these cases, where determination of the taxable income will depend on the facts, a factual position must be agreed between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue.

Penalties and tax in dispute
----------------------------

Penalties, if applicable, must be included in the final agreement.  This includes penal tax, shortfall penalties and late payment penalties.

In the case of shortfall penalties agreement can be negotiated only to the level of penalty imposed.  Shortfall penalties will not be used as leverage to achieve an agreement.

Failure to agree on penalties will not preclude an agreement on the substantive issues.  Where this occurs the penalties will continue under the disputes resolution process.

Ability to pay
--------------

The ability of the taxpayer to pay the tax is not relevant in determining a taxpayer's tax liability, but may give rise to other administrative arrangements tailored to the taxpayer's circumstances.  When the facts and law support issuing an assessment but the taxpayer will not be able to pay the tax, the assessment is still to be issued.  The taxpayer should apply under the relevant sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994, i.e. sections 176 and 177, for consideration to have the tax remitted or obtain an instalment payment arrangement.

Timing of final agreements
--------------------------

Agreements should be finalised at the completion of an investigation.

Where the attempt to finalise an agreement is unsuccessful the disputes resolution process is to be followed.

In most cases an agreement should be finalised before an assessment is issued.  The final assessment will take into account the issues agreed upon in the agreement.

When an investigation extends over several years or relates to a back year assessment, it may sometimes be possible for the investigator to progressively raise with the taxpayer matters which are the focus of potential adjustment.  Due to the limitation of time for amendment of assessments contained in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it may not be possible to conclude a final agreement for all years under consideration.  In this situation Inland Revenue may negotiate on a year by year basis.  Where this situation arises, any agreement reached will not be a precedent for the treatment of future years.

There may be circumstances where an agreement is finalised post assessment. This will occur only in rare circumstances, i.e. where there was no agreement in writing, or the time bar prevented resolution prior to the issue of the assessment.

Form of agreement
-----------------

Where the agreement is of a straightforward nature it is considered that the form IR210D, Agreed Adjustment, will be sufficient.  However, in more complex cases a final agreement must contain the following information: (Refer to appendix for an example)

*   name, address and IRD number of the taxpayer to whom the agreement relates  
      
    
*   a statement recording the terms of agreement, including who proposed the agreement  
      
    
*   a statement recording the adjustments covered by the agreement, including the tax type, section of the relevant act and period involved as well as any penal tax and shortfall penalties  
      
    
*   a statement that the taxpayer acknowledges that by signing the agreement they forfeit any further right to challenge the adjustments covered by the agreement, and that this right has been explained to them  
      
    
*   a statement acknowledging that the taxpayer has made a full and true disclosure of all known facts to the Commissioner  
      
    
*   a statement outlining the ramifications of making any false statements  
      
    
*   a statement as to the precedential effect of the agreement  
      
    
*   a statement as to the due date for payment of any deficient tax  
      
    
*   if applicable a statement as to any additional tax included in the agreement  
      
    
*   the agreement must be signed and dated by both parties.

Although the above details must be included in every agreement, additional information may be included if relevant.  However, if including additional information it is best to seek legal advice to ensure that it does not detract from the main focus of the agreement.

Where there are a lot of issues in dispute it may not be possible to finalise an agreement in respect of them all.  Where this situation arises the disputes resolution process would be limited to the unresolved issues.

Inland Revenue can make an assessment only when all issues for the periods/years have been finalised.  Where issues remain unresolved, the assessment will not be made until such time as all the outstanding issues are finalised.  This is because the Commissioner cannot make a partial assessment. In this situation the disputes resolution process is to be used to resolve the remaining issues.  All issues are to be taken into account when the assessment is finally made.

Where a situation involves a number of taxpayers i.e. partners or shareholders, an agreement reached with one person may not necessarily form the basis of an agreement for all the other parties.  This is because it is important to consider the factual background to each person's involvement and the tax position taken by that person.

Inland Revenue will adhere to the terms of the final agreement for the periods/years covered by the investigation. Re-examination of the taxpayer's affairs for the periods/years covered by the final agreement would be undertaken only where, for example, new evidence suggests that tax avoidance, evasion, fraud, manipulation or transfer pricing has occurred.  Any re-examination will also be subject to the time bar rules of section 108 and 108A of the TAA.

Inland Revenue will not be bound by any final agreement where there has been either a failure to disclose relevant facts and/or the making of a false statement.

Where a period/year has been adjusted without a full investigation of the taxpayer's affairs being carried out (e.g. an adjustment in respect of a single issue following a policy ruling) nothing in this standard practice statement prevents Inland Revenue later undertaking a full review of that period/year (other than in respect of the particular issue or issues that have been the subject of a final agreement).

Once a taxpayer has signed the final agreement or the IR210D that taxpayer is precluded from using the disputes process relating to the negotiated issues.

Failure to negotiate a final agreement
--------------------------------------

Not all taxation disputes that are capable of negotiation will necessarily lead to a final agreement being reached. During the negotiation process, Inland Revenue will enter into correspondence and discussions on a totally "without prejudice" basis.  Where a final agreement is not reached, Inland Revenue will not be bound by any factual or legal matters which may have been "agreed" on a without prejudice basis to facilitate the final agreement.

Authority to approve final agreements
-------------------------------------

The officer who has undertaken the investigation is not authorised to approve the final agreement.  There must be objectivity in the approval of final agreements.  It is therefore necessary for an independent officer to review the case.

All final agreements must be approved by the person who has authority to decide disputes for that investigator.  Generally, this will be the team leader.

In cases where approval of an assessment is required at a certain level, such as sections BG1 (tax avoidance) and GB1 (general anti-avoidance) of the Income Tax Act 1994, approval of any final agreement is to be given at that level.

Applications to keep records in Māori (Apr 98) (WITHDRAWN)
==========================================================

Withdrawn INV-470-Applications to keep records in Māori (Apr 98). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This standard practice statement advises that the Commissioner will generally approve applications to keep records in Māori, provided that:

*   The taxpayer complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"); and  
      
    
*   Numbers are recorded using Arabic numerals. In order to accommodate the needs of third parties, Arabic numerals (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) are to be used to record numbers.

This policy applies from 1 May 1998_._

### Background

Sections 75 of the GST Act, and 22, 26, and 32 of the Tax Administration Act ("TAA"), require taxpayers to keep and retain sufficient records in the English language to enable ready ascertainment by the Commissioner or his delegates, of their liability to tax.  However, each of these sections provides discretion to the Commissioner who may, following a written application, allow records to be kept in an alternative language.

The legislative policy reason for the requirement to keep records in English is administrative convenience.  It allows the Commissioner to readily ascertain a taxpayer's liability.  However, a claim lodged with the Waitangi Tribunal under the Treaty of Waitangi Act prompted Inland Revenue to review its policy for exercising the discretion related to keeping records in a language other than English.

When considering a request from a taxpayer to keep records in Māori, Inland Revenue recognises that Māori is an official language of New Zealand.  We also recognise that the choice of language for business dealings is not a matter for the Commissioner to determine.  It is reasonable for persons whose business dealings are conducted in Māori to expect that Inland Revenue will be able to accommodate their language preference.

However, the revenue law obligations of third parties must also be considered.  When base records such as invoices and receipts are maintained in Māori there may be some inconvenience to other persons.  GST tax invoices and debit and credit notes raise a special problem.  They are necessary for ascertaining the tax liability of the issuer and of a third party.  They are, therefore, records covered by section 75(3) of the GST Act (i.e., they must be maintained in English unless the Commissioner gives permission to use another language).

There are also explicit requirements for specific English phrases to be used in these documents.  These phrases are:

*   "tax invoice" (s. 24 & 25, GST Act)
*   "copy only" – on copy of lost tax invoice, credit or debit note (s. 25, GST Act)
*   "buyer created tax invoice – IRD approved" (s. 24, GST Act)
*   "modified tax invoice – IRD approved" (s. 24, GST Act)
*   "credit note" or "debit note" – on credit or debit notes (s. 25, GST Act)

There is no discretion to allow the use of expressions in Māori (or any other language) to satisfy the requirements imposed in sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act (which state that specific words must be used).

The decision by the Commissioner and his delegates to allow the keeping of records in Māori, is the exercise of an administrative discretion provided by the Revenue Acts having regard to the form of tax invoices and taxpayer obligations as prescribed by legislation.

Policy
------

**Applications**

When any person applies in writing to keep records (e.g., invoices, receipts, cash books, and journals) for tax purposes in Māori, permission will usually be granted, provided all numbers are recorded using Arabic numerals.  The application need not be in English, but must specify which records the taxpayer wishes to keep in Māori.

An application form in both English and Māori is available from Inland Revenue offices for use by persons wishing to take advantage of this policy.  The use of these forms will simplify applications and assist IRD to readily identify requests and provide a more timely response.

A person may seek approval to keep only some records in Māori.  In addition, where approval to keep certain records in Māori has been obtained, there is nothing to stop a person continuing to keep all or some of those records in English.  This would extend to having an individual document completed partly in Māori and partly in English.

**Approval process**

The Commissioner has delegated his authority, to approve applications, to officer level.  Authority to decline applications is confined to Team Leaders, Senior Investigators or Managers.  Refusals will only be on the basis those legislative requirements under the GST Act and TAA and the use of Arabic numerals are not satisfied.

The letter giving consent will advise:

*   That the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act in respect of the provision or creation of tax invoices and the issuing of debit and credit notes.  
      
    
*   That numbers must be recorded using Arabic numerals.  
      
    
*   The date from which those records can be kept in Māori (generally the date of the letter of approval).  
      
    
*   The approval is not a relaxation in the standard of record keeping \[the requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose\].  
      
    
*   The approval does not mean IRD will communicate with taxpayers in Māori.

**Further conditions**

If permission is given to keep records in Māori, there is no relaxation in the standard of record keeping.  The requirements of sections 22 and 26 of the TAA and section 75 of the GST Act are not relaxed for this purpose.

The law is silent on the question of the language to be used in completing any returns that a person may be required to provide to the Commissioner.  The Commissioner will accept returns in the prescribed format, completed in the Māori language with numbers entered using Arabic numerals.

**Impact on third parties**

When base records such as invoices and receipts which have been completed in Māori, are used by third parties to ascertain their tax liability, that third party need not also apply for permission to use records kept in Māori.

The balance of commercial convenience between buyers and sellers will determine what language is used in any particular case.  Over time, the usual Māori expressions will become known within the community.  Interpretation will, therefore, become less difficult.

**Policy application date**

This policy applies from 1 May 1998.  It will apply to records coming into existence following approval of an application lodged with the Commissioner on or after that date.

**Contact**

Should you have questions about this policy, please contact the Kaitakawaenga Māori at your nearest Inland Revenue Service Centre or Branch Office.

### Examples

The following examples do not form part of the policy but are provided to indicate its general effect.

**Example 1**

A New Zealand resident GST registered person, who is fluent in English, operates a shop in Whangarei.  They are also fluent in Māori and have asked for approval to keep certain GST business records in Māori.

Approval would be granted, subject to the requirements that the registered person uses Arabic numerals and complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act.

**Example 2**

A New Zealand resident taxpayer, who regards English as their second language and has limited bookkeeping skills, operates a farm on the East Coast.  The taxpayer is fluent in Māori and has asked for approval to keep all their business records in Māori.

Approval would be granted, subject to the requirements that they use Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 of the TAA.  As in any other case, the taxpayer's records must be sufficient to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the taxpayer's tax liabilities.

**Example 3**

A large Māori incorporation is staffed by persons whose fluency in Māori and in English differs.  For cultural and policy reasons the incorporation wishes to maintain its records in Māori to the greatest extent possible within the law.  The taxpayer has asked for approval to keep all of its business records in Māori.

Approval would be granted, subject to the requirements that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and comply with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and sections 22 and 26 (where applicable) of the TAA.

**Example 4**

A New Zealand resident private company runs a business teaching Te Reo Māori.  The company seeks approval to issue GST tax invoices printed and completed entirely in Māori.

Approval would be granted, subject to the requirements that the taxpayer uses Arabic numerals and complies with the requirements of sections 24 and 25 of the GST Act and section 22 of the TAA.

**Example 5**

A New Zealand resident GST registered person receives a tax invoice completed in Māori.  The person, who does not speak or understand Māori, contacts her local Inland Revenue office and asks the office to intervene and require the issuer of the invoice to replace it with one completed in English.

Provided the invoice has been completed in accordance with the requirement of section 24 of the GST Act and numbers are entered using Arabic numerals, the person would be advised that the document complies with our record keeping requirements in its present form.  Any dispute over the language used in completing the invoice is a matter to be settled between the recipient of the invoice and the issuer.

**Example 6**

A New Zealand resident taxpayer makes a claim in their annual income tax return for the housekeeper rebate. This is in respect of payments made to a caregiver that cared for the taxpayer's child to enable the taxpayer to work.  Upon being requested to supply a receipt to substantiate the housekeeper rebate claimed, the taxpayer supplies a receipt completed entirely in Māori, including the numbers for the amount paid written using Māori words.

The receipt would not be accepted as a satisfactory record to support the rebate claim because numbers for the amounts paid have not been entered using Arabic numerals.

Taxpayer amendments to tax returns (Oct 99) (WITHDRAWN)
=======================================================

Withdrawn statement SPS INV-500 Taxpayer amendments to tax returns. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

The Disputes Resolution regime requires taxpayers to follow a formal process when requesting an adjustment to a previously filed tax return. This Standard Practice Statement, in conjunction with SPS INV 490, states the Commissioner's operational practice when taxpayers wish to make adjustments to tax returns.

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement applies to taxes and duties payable under a tax law from 1st December 1999, and to adjustments made on or after this date, regardless of the return period when the error occurred. These practices do not apply to assessments issued under the Child Support Act 1991 or to ACC assessments, except to the extent that the ACC adjustment occurs as a result of an income tax change.

Definitions
-----------

**Credit adjustment:** an adjustment that results in a reduced amount payable, increases a net loss, or increases a refund.

**Debit adjustment:** an adjustment that results in an increase in the amount payable, reduces the amount of a refund or reduces a net loss.

**Response period:** the response period referred to in this SPS is the two-month period starting on the date of issue of a notice of assessment or determination of loss. For GST purposes the response period is the two-month period commencing the day after the last day for filing the GST return.

Calculation of the tax effect of an adjustment
----------------------------------------------

**Income tax**

The tax effect of an item in a return period is calculated using the taxpayer's marginal tax rates for the return period in which the error arose, not the period in which it is subsequently corrected.

If a taxpayer has no tax to pay in the period in which the error arose, the rate of tax that applies is the lowest marginal rate that would apply to the return period if the taxpayer did have tax to pay.

**Other taxes**

The tax effect of an item in a return period is calculated by multiplying the value of the item adjusted by the applicable rate of tax. For example the amount of an FBT adjustment is calculated by multiplying the value of the benefit by 49%.

The total tax effect of an adjustment is calculated by adding the tax effect of all return periods affected by the item adjusted.

Correcting small errors in Income tax and Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) returns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many instances the costs to the taxpayer and Inland Revenue in correcting small errors is significant in relation to the tax effect of the adjustment, and in some cases may prove a deterrent to taxpayers correcting errors. As a solution to this problem, Inland Revenue will now allow small errors in Income tax and FBT returns to be corrected in the following return period where the income tax or FBT effect of the adjustment or adjustments is $500 or less per return period.

In designing this practice, Inland Revenue considered the Care and Management provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 charges the Commissioner with the care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. Subsection 3 of that section states:

> "In collecting the taxes committed to the Commissioner's charge, and notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to -  
> 
> 1.  The resources available to the Commissioner; and
> 2.  The importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and
> 3.  The compliance costs incurred by taxpayers."

The Commissioner also used the Care and Management provisions in SPS INV-490, to implement a practice whereby registered persons are able to self-correct GST errors in a subsequent GST return. (See TIB Volume Ten No.6 (June 1998), and TIB Volume Eleven No.2 (February 1999). The extension of self-correction of small errors to income tax and FBT returns is consistent with the principles of that practice.

Application of self-correction
------------------------------

Self-correction is only practicable for revenues where there is no impact on unrelated taxpayers, as errors in certain tax returns can result in the need for consequential adjustments to third party's returns (e.g. An error in PAYE deductions accounted for may lead to a consequential adjustment to a recipient's tax return). This has led Inland Revenue to limit the application of self- correction to income tax, FBT and GST. However, self-correction also caters to those situations where one adjustment affects related taxpayers. This means that self-correction can be made to an income tax return filed by a partnership (for example), with the resulting adjustments to the partners' tax returns.

Because the tax affairs of those taxpayers who receive only source deduction payments (i.e. salary or wages) are simple, self correction does not apply to IR 5 tax returns, or (from 1 April 1999), income statements.

Income tax and annual FBT returns are for a full year, and self-correction will result in a deferral of tax for 12 months or more. Therefore income tax and annual FBT errors can only be corrected in the immediately succeeding return if it has not already been filed when the error is detected. For example, errors in a 1998 tax return can only be self-corrected in the 1999 year. Quarterly FBT returns may be self corrected in a following return period if the correction is made when it is found, and within twelve months of the period in which the error arose.

Compliance and penalties provisions
-----------------------------------

The implementation of the Compliance and Penalties regime in 1997 included universal interest to provide compensation for tax that has been under or over-paid. This was intended, along with the other changes introduced, to encourage voluntary compliance, i.e. taxpayers had greater incentive to get things right first time. Allowing for self-correction in a following period will mean that interest is not charged in these circumstances, thus alleviating a potential barrier to compliance.

Inland Revenue reserves the right to impose shortfall penalties and assess the correct tax position in the year in which the error arose if:

*   we believe the taxpayer's original tax position was not a genuine mistake; or
*   the taxpayer repeatedly makes the same or similar mistake and self-corrects; or
*   the practice is used to create an unwarranted advantage.

Where errors are detected during an audit or investigation the taxpayer will only be allowed to self-correct errors in the following return if the total tax effect of the error or errors is $500 or less per return period, and the immediately following return has not already been filed. However, taxpayers will be allowed to self-correct errors that are disclosed at the time an audit is commenced (subject to the conditions above).

In view of the considerations above, a requirement of self-correction is that sufficient records must be kept to show:

*   The return period the error occurred
*   The amount of tax involved
*   The nature of the error
*   The return period correction was made

These records must be readily available for review by Inland Revenue staff.

General Rule for adjustments to tax returns over the telephone
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Changes to PAYE returns (IR 66N, IR 66W, IR 68P, IR 345, IR 346, IR 348, IR 349),
2.  Changes to Non-Resident Withholding tax and Approved Issuer Levy returns (IR 67P, IR 67S),
3.  Changes to Resident Withholding (IR 15P, IR 15S),
4.  Changes to Non-resident individual income tax returns (IR 3NR),
5.  Transposition of numbers and arithmetical errors in all returns,
6.  Changes to the rebates for an IR 3 or IR 5 returns, (excluding the donations rebate),
7.  Changes to Family Assistance,
8.  Adjustments where the tax effect falls within the criteria allowed for under self-correction.

Other credit adjustments
------------------------

Small errors in FBT, income tax and GST returns may be self-corrected in a following period, subject to the conditions specified above and in SPS INV 490.

Employer Monthly schedules may be amended by telephoning or by sending an Employer monthly schedule amendments form (IR 344) to correct the error in the period in which it arose.

All other types of credit adjustment must be made in writing. Where the total tax effect of the adjustment is $2,000 or more, a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) on the prescribed form must be issued. The tax effect of an adjustment is calculated by adding the tax effect of all tax return periods affected by the item adjusted. For example, an omitted item of expenditure has an income tax effect of $1650 and a GST effect of $555. As the total tax effect of the adjustment is greater than $2,000, a Notice of Proposed Adjustment is required. The only exception to this requirement is if the error has arisen because of a simple arithmetical or transposition error.

The Commissioner's practice applying to the content standards for Notices of Proposed Adjustment can be found in Standard Practice Statement INV 150, published in TIB Volume 11, No.6 (July 1999).

A NOPA must be issued where the issue involves a contestable interpretation of tax law, regardless of the tax effect of the adjustment, even if the tax effect is $500 or less.

If the adjustment is being requested after the expiry of the applicable response period, an explanation must be included as to why the request should be accepted late, unless it relates to a simple arithmetical or transposition error.

If the amount of the adjustment is less than $2,000, use of the NOPA form is optional, however all NOPAs are given priority by Inland Revenue. If an informal request for an adjustment has been made, and the issue has not been resolved within the applicable initial response period, a NOPA should be issued to protect the taxpayers right to further challenge the item in contention.

Inland Revenue will no longer accept amended tax returns for any credit adjustments.

Other debit adjustments
-----------------------

Small errors in FBT, income tax and GST tax returns may be self-corrected in a following period, subject to the conditions specified above and in SPS INV 490.

Employer Monthly schedules may be amended by telephoning or by sending an Employer monthly schedule amendment form (IR 344).

In addition to those specified in the General rule above, debit adjustments may be made to IR3, IR 3NR, GST and FBT returns by telephone or in writing.

Adjustments to other tax returns must be requested in writing. Use of the NOPA form for these adjustments is optional, however all NOPAs are given priority. If an informal request for an adjustment has been made, and the issue has not been resolved within the applicable initial response period, a NOPA should be issued to protect the taxpayers right to further challenge the item in contention.

Any debit adjustments requested by way of Notice of Proposed Adjustment will be treated as voluntary disclosure for the purposes of consideration of penalties.

Inland Revenue will not accept amended tax returns for any debit adjustment.

Summary
-------

1.  Taxpayers may self-correct minor errors in income tax, FBT and GST returns, subject to the conditions outlined above and in Inland Revenue Standard Practice Statement INV 490.
2.  Requests for correction of errors such as the transposition of numbers, or arithmetical mistakes may be made by telephone or in writing.
3.  Adjustments that result in an increase in tax to pay, reduction of a refund or a decrease in the amount of net loss may be requested by telephone or in writing. Those that are requested on the prescribed Notice of Proposed Adjustment form will be given priority consideration.
4.  In general requests for adjustment where the tax effect is a decrease in tax to pay must be made in writing. Where the proposed adjustment has a tax effect of $2,000 or more, or where the issue involves contestable interpretation of tax law, the request must be made on the prescribed Notice of Proposed Adjustment form unless it is correcting a simple arithmetical or transposition error.
5.  Amended or ‘second' tax returns will no longer be accepted.

Requests to amend assessments (Aug 02) (WITHDRAWN)
==================================================

Withdrawn statement INV-510-Requests to amend assessments. Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may exercise the discretion to amend assessments to ensure correctness.

Application
-----------

This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) applies from 1 September 2002.

This SPS applies to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (referred to as "section 113" in this SPS) and section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (referred to as "section 27(2)" in this SPS).

This SPS replaces all previous statements on the Commissioner's practices when exercising the discretion under section 113, including those contained in SPS INV-300 _Acceptance of late objections under section 126 of the Tax Administration Act 1994_ (March 1997).

SPS INV-500 _Taxpayer amendments to tax returns, Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 11, No 9 (October 1999) is withdrawn from the above application date.

This SPS should be read in conjunction with SPS INV-490 _GST returns – correcting minor errors (and clarification), ( Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol 10, No 6 (June 1998) and Vol 11, No 2 (February 1999) respectively) and SPS INV-251 _Voluntary Disclosures (Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 14, No 4).

Legislation
-----------

**Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides:**

> **113** Commissioner may at any time amend assessments
> 
> **113(1)** **\[Amendments at any time\]** The Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment as the Commissioner thinks necessary in order to ensure its correctness, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid.
> 
> **113(2) \[Fresh liability\]** If any such alteration or addition has the effect of imposing any fresh liability or increasing any existing liability, notice of it shall be given by the Commissioner to the taxpayer affected.

**Section 27(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides:**

> **27(2) \[Alterations\]** Subject to sections 108A and 108B and Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner may from time to time and at any time make all such alterations in or additions to an assessment made under this section as the Commissioner thinks necessary to ensure the correctness of the assessment, notwithstanding that tax already assessed may have been paid.

Summary
-------

Section 113 and section 27(2) enable the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure correctness.  This allows the Commissioner to amend assessments when the Commissioner considers an assessment contains an error or following the application of the disputes provisions contained in Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA).

Inland Revenue considers section 113 and section 27(2) operate alongside the disputes resolution process provisions (disputes provisions) contained in Part IVA of the TAA.  The disputes provisions provide the procedures for resolving disputes between the Commissioner and taxpayers.  Accordingly it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to exercise his discretion under section 113 and section 27(2) when the amendment is the subject of a dispute, however an assessment can be amended following completion of the disputes process or to reflect an agreed adjustment.

When the Commissioner considers an assessment contains a genuine error, and there is no dispute, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend the assessment to correct the error.  Inland Revenue considers section 113 and section 27(2) provide the power to amend assessments where genuine errors have been made.

This SPS is directed at those instances where genuine errors have been made.  It does not provide a mechanism for circumventing the disputes resolution process.  The Commissioner will amend an assessment, on a case by case basis, when the Commissioner is satisfied that a genuine error was made and that none of the limitations outlined in this SPS apply.

This SPS has been prepared to assist with consistency and understanding how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion to amend assessments following taxpayer requests.

Discussion
----------

Section 113 and section 27(2) contain a broad discretion allowing the Commissioner to amend assessments to ensure correctness.  They provide little guidance as to how the Commissioner should exercise this discretion in practice.  Accordingly it is also necessary to look at the scheme of the legislation and at case law.

**Decision to consider request**

Case law indicates the Commissioner cannot be compelled to either amend an assessment or investigate a claim that an assessment is in error.  The power in that regard is for the Commissioner to voluntarily exercise.  See _Commonwealth Agricultural Services Engineers Ltd (In Liquidation) v CIR_ \[1926\] 38 CLR 289, _CIR v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 and _Lawton v CIR_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531.

Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that an assessment contains an error, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend an assessment.  See _Wood v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,255.  Case law also indicates that if the Commissioner does decide to consider a claim by a taxpayer that an assessment is in error the Commissioner does not have an absolute obligation to amend the assessment when an error has been verified.  See _CIR v Wilson_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512 and _Lawton v CIR_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,531.

Case law further indicates section 113 can be invoked after a dispute has been initiated or where there is no dispute that an assessment is in error.  See _O'Neil & Ors v CIR_ (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051.

These cases refer specifically to section 113, however the principles are applicable to the exercise of the discretion in section 27(2).

**Limitations**

The Tax Administration Act 1994 contains provisions that impose time limits on increasing assessments.

*   sections 107A & 108 (time bar for amendment of assessments) - the Commissioner cannot increase tax assessments after 4 years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provides the tax return.  Section 113 is subject to these legislative time limits when increasing tax liabilities.
*   section 108A (time bar for assessment of GST) - the Commissioner cannot increase an assessment of GST after four years from the end of the GST period for which the return was provided or assessment made.

Furthermore, through the operation of section MD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), the Commissioner is prevented from refunding amounts of overpaid tax (excluding GST) after 8 years from the end of the year in which the original assessment was made.  Any refunds arising from the operation of section 113 are also subject to this legislative time limit.

Section 45 of the GST Act prevents the Commissioner refunding amounts of overpaid GST after 8 years from the end of the taxable period in respect of which the assessment was made.  Refunds arising from the reduction of a GST liability under section 27(2) are also subject to this legislative time limit.

In broad terms, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to action a taxpayer's request to amend an assessment.  However, the Commissioner does have a duty to correct errors verified by the Commissioner where to do so is consistent with the Commissioner's duty under sections 6 and 6A (care and management provisions) of the TAA and such amendment is within the limits set out in this Standard Practice Statement.

**Care and management considerations**

It is important to recognise that the Commissioner does not have unlimited resources to undertake lengthy verification processes to determine whether assessments should be amended.  When meeting the duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, section 6A(3) of the TAA requires the Commissioner to consider: the resources available to the Commissioner; promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers; and compliance costs.  Accordingly it is consistent with the Commissioner's duty under section 6A(3) for the Commissioner to limit the amount of time that will be spent investigating a request for an assessment to be amended.  Ensuring a balance between time spent considering requests to amend assessments and other activities is consistent with the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system under section 6 of the TAA.  By providing full information to evidence their requests, taxpayers are assisting the Commissioner to uses resources efficiently.

By having a practice of amending assessments to ensure correctness where genuine errors have been made, the Commissioner is ensuring fairness to all taxpayers – to those taxpayers who have made a genuine error and to those taxpayers who get their returns or assessments correct the first time.  This also promotes integrity in the administration of the tax system.

**Principles**

The following principles have been established as the basis for the Standard Practice set out below:

*   Generally, arithmetic, transposition and other types of genuine errors verified by the Commissioner will be corrected – subject to statutory time limits, care and management considerations and other limitations set out in this SPS.  
      
    
*   Where a taxpayer is requesting the Commissioner to amend an assessment, the taxpayer must provide all relevant information with the request.  
      
    
*   All relevant factors must be taken into account when the Commissioner is considering a taxpayer's request to amend an assessment.  In some cases the length of time that has passed since the error was made may be a relevant factor, however it may not necessarily determine whether the Commissioner will amend or not.  
      
    
*   Taxpayers cannot compel the Commissioner to amend an assessment.  
      
    
*   If the Commissioner is satisfied that an assessment contains a genuine error the Commissioner does not have an absolute obligation to amend the assessment.  
      
    
*   Whether something is a genuine error is determined by the Commissioner.  A genuine error in an assessment is something that has resulted in the taxpayer paying the incorrect amount of tax – either too much or too little.  
      
    
*   Generally the Commissioner will not amend an assessment while the proposed amendment is the subject of a dispute.  However an assessment can be amended to reflect an agreed adjustment.  
      
    
*   Interest will apply to tax that has been underpaid or overpaid.  
      
    
*   A taxpayer is liable to a shortfall penalty where they have not met the requisite standards of care.

Standard Practice
-----------------

The following standard practice has been developed from the above principles.

**Taxpayer's requests**

A taxpayer or their agent requesting the Commissioner amend an assessment to correct a genuine error, is required to supply the Commissioner with all relevant information to evidence the claim at the time the request is made, including:

*   tax type and period containing the error
*   amount of tax in error
*   nature of the error
*   how the error occurred
*   how and why the error was identified
*   action required to ensure correctness.

_Types of errors_  
Common errors may be arithmetic or transposition errors.  There may also be other types of errors which are clear and genuine.

**Considering requests**

When considering taxpayer requests to amend assessments the Commissioner must take into account all relevant factors on a case by case basis.

Where a taxpayer or their agent claims an assessment contains a genuine error, Inland Revenue will:

*   determine whether the request is clear
*   request the taxpayer or their agent clarify a request that is not clear.

The Commissioner will amend an assessment when the Commissioner considers _all_ of the following are met:

*   the request is clear
*   all information has been provided
*   the error has been verified by the Commissioner
*   the amendment is within the time limits (see below)
*   none of the other limitations apply (see below).

Where the Commissioner is not satisfied that a genuine error exists or considers one or more of the limitations apply, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment.  Where such a decision is made, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or agent of the decision and the reasons for the decision.

**Limitations**

The following are limitations on the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion to amend assessments.

_Time limits_  
The Commissioner can only increase a tax assessment within 4 years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer provided the tax return.  For GST, the 4-year period runs from the end of the GST return period for which the GST return was provided or the assessment was made.

The Commissioner can only make a refund of excess tax/GST within 8 years from the end of:

*   the year in which the assessment was made in the case of tax (excluding GST); or
*   the taxable period in respect of which the assessment was made in the case of GST.

_Interpretation of legislation in issue_  
When the interpretation of legislation is in issue, the Commissioner does not consider it appropriate to amend an assessment outside the disputes resolution process.  Interpretations of legislation should properly be considered in the disputes resolution process.

_Not a genuine error_  
If, after considering all relevant information, the Commissioner is not satisfied that a genuine error was made, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment.  For example, the facts may indicate a tax position was adopted rather than a genuine error having occurred.

_Requests following Court, TRA or adjudication decisions, or Rulings_  
When a taxpayer requests amendment of an assessment to reflect a decision affecting the same or another taxpayer, the Commissioner will generally not amend the assessment.  However when exercising the discretion, the Commissioner will take into account all relevant factors including:

*   whether the taxpayer has consistently asserted that they are entitled to a deduction (in contrast to a taxpayer who never sought a deduction in the past, but who becomes aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer and tries to avail themselves of it)
*   whether the taxpayer has been associated with a claim or action against Inland Revenue on an issue relevant to the request
*   whether Inland Revenue has told the taxpayer that the outcome of a particular issue would be applied to the taxpayer.

_Requests following change in Commissioner's practice_  
When a taxpayer requests amendment of an assessment to reflect a change in Commissioner's practice, the Commissioner will generally not amend the assessment.  However, the Commissioner will take into account all relevant factors and taxpayers will be notified when the Commissioner will exercise his discretion to amend assessments in these circumstances.

_Current dispute_  
When the requested amendment is the subject of a current dispute the Commissioner will not make the amendment unless the amendment is to reflect an agreed adjustment.

_Regretted choice (choice between valid options)_  
Where a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to change an assessment from one valid option to another, there is no error to correct.  Accordingly the assessment will not be amended.  This is a matter of regretted choice.  An example of regretted choice is where a taxpayer chooses one of several options for the calculation of a tax liability and subsequently requests to change that option.

If however, the taxpayer can prove that the taxpayer's return erroneously reflected their choice then the Commissioner may consider the request to amend the assessment.

_Amended returns_  
Although a taxpayer's request does not have to be in any particular form, Inland Revenue will not accept amended returns to correct errors.  However, an amended tax calculation may be provided in support of a request to amend.  When correcting minor errors in GST returns, see Standard Practice Statement INV-490 _GST returns – correcting minor errors (and clarification), Tax Information Bulletins_ Vol 10, No 6 (June 1998) and Vol 11, No 2 (February 1999) respectively.

Tax agents may use the Inland Revenue _Tax agents' request form (IR 796)_ when requesting amendment of assessments.  However, to ensure all relevant information is provided to Inland Revenue, it may be necessary to provide information in addition to the information provided on the form.

**General**

_Shortfall penalties_  
Where the request to amend an assessment meets the requirements for a voluntary disclosure, any applicable shortfall penalties will be reduced pursuant to section 141G of the TAA.

_Fresh liability_  
If any alteration or addition to an assessment imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability, then the Commissioner will give notice to the taxpayer affected.

Application where returns are amended before due date (Feb 99) (WITHDRAWN)
==========================================================================

Withdrawn INV-570 Application where returns are amended before due date (Feb 99). Statement provided for historical purposes only.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

Introduction
------------

This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) outlines the Commissioner's practice when a taxpayer files a return taking an incorrect tax position and then seeks to amend the return before the due date for filing the return.

Application
-----------

This SPS applies for the period from 1 March 1999 to 31 March 2001.  It applies to all amendments made to a return before due date, including amendments requested by phone call, letter, NOPA or by filing an amended return.  It does **not** apply to **income tax** returns.

Background
----------

The Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes shortfall penalties in all cases when a taxpayer breaches the standards defined in sections 141A to E and takes an incorrect tax position creating a tax shortfall.  This applies even if the return is amended before the due date for filing the return.

If the incorrect tax position was not caused by a breach of the taxpayers' statutory obligations, shortfall penalties cannot be imposed.

Except for income tax, taxpayers take their tax position at the date when they file the return.  This is the assessment date regardless of whether it is before the due date for filing the return.  Therefore when taxpayers file an incorrect return they have taken an incorrect tax position at that date.

The definition of taxpayer's tax position is different for income tax.  If a taxpayer alters the tax position taken in an income tax return before the earlier of the due date or when the assessment is issued, the amended return will be accepted as the taxpayer's tax position.

To date, in accordance with the legislation, Inland Revenue has been proposing shortfall penalties in some cases when the taxpayer has amended a return before the due date, with a 75% reduction for voluntary disclosure before notification of a pending tax audit or investigation.  However, we are concerned that imposing shortfall penalties in these situations may discourage taxpayers from voluntarily disclosing an incorrect tax position.  This would not be in keeping with the purpose of the penalty regime, which is to encourage taxpayers to voluntarily co-operate with Inland Revenue.

To encourage voluntary disclosure Inland Revenue will take a liberal approach.  We will not impose shortfall penalties if a taxpayer independently and voluntarily files an amended return before due date.  However, we reserve the right to impose shortfall penalties in all situations if we believe that the taxpayer's original tax position was not a genuine mistake or if the taxpayer repeatedly makes the same or similar mistake and files amendments to the returns before due date.

Practice
--------

Inland Revenue will adopt the following approach:

**_If taxpayer amends return before due date and before IRD advises taxpayer of acceptance or non-acceptance of original tax position_**

In this situation the taxpayer has realised the mistake and has voluntarily notified IRD of the incorrect tax position.  To impose shortfall penalties would discourage taxpayers from making such voluntarily disclosures in the future.  The taxpayer has independently found and corrected the mistake before due date so Inland Revenue will not impose shortfall penalties.

Notification that the tax position has or has not been processed or accepted for processing will be the date the taxpayer or agent receives written advice or a statement of account, or the time of a telephone call advising of a pending tax audit or investigation.

If the exact time of the written advice/statement of account becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by section 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.  This is in accordance with the Standard Practice Statement INV-250 on Voluntary Disclosure.

**_If taxpayer amends return before due date but after IRD advises taxpayer of acceptance of original tax position_**

In this situation the taxpayer has independently realised the mistake and chooses to file an amended return before the due date.  Again to impose shortfall penalties in this situation would discourage this type of voluntary disclosure.  Generally Inland Revenue would not impose shortfall penalties because the taxpayer has independently found and corrected the mistake before due date.

If a refund is issued or the tax becomes due before the taxpayer files an amended return interest will be charged in accordance with Section 120.

Inland Revenue reserves the right to impose penalties if the amended return filed before due date is not correcting a genuine mistake.  That is, the shortfall may be considered for penalties if we believe that the taxpayer intentionally attempted to overstate a benefit or understate tax by filing an incorrect first return.  If we believe this may be the case we will need to request details as to why the shortfall occurred.

An example of the above would be if a vendor who has entered into a property transaction (for which an early return has been filed) omits to return the sale and then finds out that Inland Revenue is auditing the purchaser of the property.  In this situation the vendor might quickly put in an amended return because they consider that IRD would check up on whether the vendor has returned the sale.

**_If taxpayer amends return before due date but after IRD advises taxpayer of pending audit/investigation_**

In this case the taxpayer did not amend the return until after Inland Revenue gave notice that the tax position was to be examined.  Inland Revenue will consider shortfall penalties in this situation.  To establish whether the shortfall was the result of a breach of sections 141A to E we will need to request details of how the shortfall occurred.  If a penalty is warranted it will be reduced by 40% as a post-notification voluntary disclosure or 75% as a temporary shortfall.

If penalties were not imposed in these situations taxpayers would have an incentive to file early returns, overstating their benefit or understating their tax.  If IRD does not accept the tax position taken the taxpayer could send in an amendment before the due date to avoid penalties.  This does not encourage voluntary compliance first time.  Consideration of a penalty in this instance prevents taxpayers abusing the opportunity to take a tax position beneficial to themselves before the due date.

**_If taxpayer repeatedly makes same/similar mistake then amends return before due date_**

Inland Revenue wants to continue to encourage taxpayers to take the correct tax position when filing their returns.  Therefore in situations like this we may consider imposing a shortfall penalty.

Invalid asset transfers were in reality loans
=============================================

2009 case note – CIR directed to prepare amended financial statements allowing for loans – debt, transfer of assets, trusts.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Allen, Palmer and Silver Fern Trustees Limited

Legislative References

High Court Rules

### Summary

There were loans owing from Silver Fern Trustees Ltd to Allen and Palmer. Certain assets were to be recorded as assets of Silver Fern Trustees Ltd and the Commissioner was directed to prepare amended financial statements for Silver Fern Trustees Ltd.

### Impact of decision

This decision turns on the particular facts of this case. However, it shows the judicial consideration of loans purporting to the other transfers.

### Facts

Following an investigation into the tax affairs of Mr Allen and Mr Palmer and subsequent assessments of tax, the Commissioner obtained judgment against Mr Allen (for $1,520,693) and Mr Palmer (for $1,519,618). The Commissioner asserted that there were debts owed to Mr Allen and/or Mr Palmer by Silver Fern Trustees Limited ("Silver Fern") and sought a court declaration to that effect.

Mr Allen and Mr Palmer are United States citizens who came to New Zealand on 16 August 1999. While in New Zealand they promoted an investment scheme supposedly involved in the purchase of offshore corporate structures, typically in Panama, through which high-yielding investments were to be made. The investment scheme was fraudulent, but unfortunately significant funds were paid over by unwitting investors.

On 16 April 2004, following a Serious Fraud Office investigation into his activities between August 1999 and August 2001, Mr Allen was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud members of the public and of using a document with intent to obtain a pecuniary advantage. Mr Allen was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and was subsequently paroled and deported in April 2007.

On 23 May 2003 Mr Palmer was convicted in the United States District Court on charges of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and the filing of false and fraudulent tax returns. Mr Palmer was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment and is not due for release until June 2010.

Neither Mr Allen nor Mr Palmer has taken steps to defend the proceedings brought by the Commissioner.

Silver Fern was incorporated on 27 April 2001 with Mr Allen and Mr Palmer as the initial shareholders and directors. By February 2002 the Companies Office records showed Mr Allen as sole shareholder and director. While there were later changes to the directors and shareholders, Mr Allen remained one of the directors and ultimate owner of the shares.

Silver Fern is the Trustee of the Silver Fern Trust ("the Trust") established by Mr Allen on 27 April 2001. The purposes of the Silver Fern Trust included settling the purchase of a property at 46 Puriri Drive, Whenuapai ("the Whenuapai property") to provide a home in New Zealand for Mr Allen's family while visiting or living in New Zealand. The beneficiaries of the Trust included Mr Allen and his family. In early May 2001 Silver Fern settled the purchase of the Whenuapai property.

The Commissioner obtained in April 2002 a charging order nisi on property other than land which included a number of motorcycles owned by Mr Allen and Mr Palmer and a Mareva injunction over various assets of Silver Fern (as well as Mr Allen and Mr Palmer) including the net proceeds of the sale of the Whenuapai property and additional motorcycles and motor vehicles.

The Commissioner sought to either enforce the judgment amounts against Silver Fern in the same manner as if he had judgment against that company, or issue a sale order to seize Mr Allen's and/or Mr Palmer's personal property, including debts owed to them by Silver Fern.

The Commissioner challenged three financial transactions purportedly recorded in the Silver Fern's financial statements which gave rise to the following issues.

#### Issue 1

Whether a sum of $200,000 paid by Mr Palmer by way of deposit for the purchase of a Whenuapai property was a loan to Silver Fern, and if so whether that loan has since been repaid.

#### Issue 2

Whether the balance of the purchase price paid to settle the purchase of the Whenuapai property was a loan from Messrs Allen and/or Palmer to Silver Fern as trustee of the Trust or a gift from a company in Panama known as Fortune Management.

#### Issue 3

Whether Silver Fern as trustee of the Trust owed any moneys to either Mr Allen, or to Mr Palmer, or to both of them, on account of certain motor vehicles and motorcycles that are shown in some versions of the financial accounts as being assets of Silver Fern.

### Decision

#### Issue 1

Wylie J concluded that accounts for Silver Fern for the 2003 year and following should reflect that there was a debt owing by the Trust to Mr Palmer which included the sum of $200,000 paid by Mr Palmer as the deposit on the purchase of the Whenuapai property.

There was clear evidence that the $200,000 paid by Mr Palmer as a deposit on the purchase of the Whenuapai property was a loan. Assertions by Silver Fern that the money had been repaid in part or full were not borne out by any documentation or evidence.

#### Issue 2

The Commissioner asserted the balance of the consideration by Silver Fern, $1,932,340, for the purchase of the Whenuapai property was a loan to Silver Fern as trustee of the Trust from Messrs Allen and Palmer in proportion to their contributions, and that this loan remained unpaid.

Silver Fern contended that the balance of the consideration was received by Silver Fern as trustee of the Trust as a cash gift or settlement from an entity in Panama.

Wylie J found that the money originated from an entity known as Fortune Management which was based in Panama. While none of the evidence was decisive by itself, collectively they compelled the conclusion that Messrs Allen and Palmer and their financial affairs were inextricably intertwined with Fortune Management Services Inc and probably Fortune Development Services Inc.

There was nothing in evidence to suggest that there was any gift by Fortune Management Services Inc, or that it settled the money on the Trust. Given the absence of any commercial justification for a gift or a settlement and given the deep involvement of Messrs Allen and Palmer in the affairs of Fortune Management Services Inc, Wylie J found that the moneys were in effect a payment by Fortune Management Services Inc, to Messrs Allen and Palmer to enable them to meet their obligations under the agreement for sale and purchase. They in turn advanced the money to Silver Fern so that it could complete the purchase of the Whenuapai property on behalf of the Trust. The money should be treated as a joint advance to the Trust by both Mr Allen and Mr Palmer.

#### Issue 3

The Commissioner claimed that there was a debt owing by the Trust to Messrs Allen and Palmer in proportion to their contributions to the purchase of the motor vehicles and motorcycles which remains unpaid and can be attached to the net proceeds of the sale held in the name of Silver Fern.

Silver Fern denied that there had been any loan and that the motor vehicles and motor cycles were never properly transferred to Silver Fern and it held them as bare trustee.

The evidence was that the vehicles were either purchased in Mr Palmer's name or from money which came from him. Some of the vehicles had been transferred to the Trust on Mr Allen's instructions and in breach of the Court orders in existence at that time.

Wylie J found where the evidence supported authorisation or approval of the transfer of the motor cycles or motor vehicles to the Trust, the vehicles became an asset of the Trust with a debt created back as a result of the transfer. Without such supporting evidence his Honour concluded the particular asset could not be treated as an asset of the Trust, nor could there be a debt created by the transfer to the Trust.

### Conclusion

This judgment was issued as an interim judgment. His Honour's finding means there will need to be alterations to the financial accounts to reflect those findings. The Commissioner was directed to prepare and file amended accounts together with a memorandum raising any further orders required. Silver Fern could then file its response. A final judgment will then be issued confirming the accounts and addressing any matters arising.

In this case, the first two messages are warnings to notify those totals in the header record do not match the detail records (shown as a warning alert circle with an exclamation mark). These warning messages notify the user that something may have gone wrong with the file, but it could still be submitted if that was all that was wrong. The last message is an error with the IRD number, that will stop the file from being submitted. Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Investment Income Reporting Legislation passed in March 2018 includes several provisions regarding the reporting of investment income information. The reporting changes are intended to give IR a better understanding of investment income and will enable tax and social policy to be administered more effectively. As at 1 April 2020, these changes are now mandatory. 3.1 Summary of changes as at 1 April 2020 • More frequent reporting of investment income in an electronic format is compulsory. • Payers of interest (including interest on domestically issued debt subject to the approved issuer levy), dividends and taxable Māori authority distributions are required to provide investment income information to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the month following the month in which the income was paid. • Payers of investment income are required to provide more detailed information about the payee where it has been provided to them by the payee. The key changes to note are the provision of: • date of birth of the payee • contact address, and • details about joint account holders (if any). • It is no longer necessary to issue end-of-year RWT on interest certificates to recipients of interest income if they have provided the payer with their IRD number. 3.2 File Upload Process This is one of the channels to submit investment income information to IR and is accessed via myIR. To access this service, the payer must: • have a myIR account, • be enrolled for electronic Investment Income Reporting (refer to this webpage for information on the enrolment process), • be enrolled for the tax type they wish to upload a file for (i.e. AIL, DWT, IPS, RWT, NRT), and • have access rights to file for the tax type. If the above pre-conditions are met, the payer may navigate to the File Upload service by completing the following steps: 1. navigate to the Accounts tab, 2. select the tax type to file a return for, 3. select a return period to file for, 4. select the Upload file button, then 5. choose a file to upload as per the below screenshot: Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The file selected must be a comma-separated value (csv) file format. (A csv file is a delimited text file that uses commas to separate values, where each line of the file is a data record). If there are no errors in the file it will be submitted. If there are errors present, these will be detailed in error messages, and the payer will need to correct the errors and resubmit the file. The following section contains the detailed specifications for the csv files for each tax type. Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 CSV File Specifications This section details the format of the csv files required to be provided to IR for the AIL, DWT, IPS, NRT and RWT tax types. 4.1 CSV File structure The Investment income reporting csv file has two sections in its data structure: • A single header record • One or more customer detail records The header record holds the summary details and precedes the customer detail records. It will contain data about the payer, the tax type and the total amount of tax deductions for the month being filed. The detail record holds the individual customer details such as name, address and the amount of tax deducted. Every customer record will include a Parent (or primary) record and may or may not include one or more Child records. The Child records should contain the Joint account owner details (if held by the payer). Include one child record for every additional joint account holder owning the account. E.g. For an account owned jointly by 3 persons – A, B and C, three rows of data will need to be submitted – a parent record including the details for customer A and 2 child records for customers B and C. The file must be uploaded in the csv format. Zipped files cannot be uploaded. The following specifications contain the data elements associated with each withholding tax type. They specify the • attribute type (data attributes are defined in the Appendix 5.2), • the maximum field size, • if the data element is a required field or optional • any associated data validations • any default values/notes that apply for each element. Important Note: Specific fields have a legislative requirement for the information to be provided if it is held by the payer at the time of filing. Please refer to Schedule 6 of Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill for further information. Data fields which are required to be provided if held by the payer include: • Payee IRD number • Payee date of birth (if payee is a person) • The IRD number, date of birth and address details of the Joint owners of the account In other cases, the data element may be required only if certain conditions are met. For example, in the case of the payee contact details, at least one of either address, email or phone number is required. If one of these is supplied, the other two become optional. Conditions will be detailed in the Validation column. Note: Where optional data is not held (i.e. DOB, address, email or phone number), those fields should be left blank. However, if IRD number is not held, the field must be filled with 9 zeros. 4.1.1 Submitting multiple files There may be circumstances where a payer may need to submit multiple files for the same month for a tax type. You can elect to become a ‘multi-filer’, allowing you to submit multiple Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] files.

Depending on the file size, it can either be placed in a local or a LAN drive. 5.1.3 File naming suggestions There is no standard file naming required. However, for easier identification we suggest the following: • A unique, period-based name. • Inclusion of the type of return to differentiate it from other returns, which may be required to be filed electronically in the future. • A CSV extension to indicate the file type. 5.1.4 End of record indicator Each header and detail record must end with a carriage return and line feed, which is ASCII character 13, followed by ASCII character 10. 5.1.5 Trailer record There is no trailer record required. Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.2 Data attributes The following is a list of valid attributes accepted by the myIR system: Data type Description ALPHA Alphabetic characters only. Alphabetic: Any letter or space (“a” to “z”, “A” to “Z” and space). Leading and trailing spaces must be trimmed; field values must not be enclosed in quotes; blank values must have a format of comma comma i.e.,, NUM A positive integer of a given length. No ‘+’ sign (unless being used for a phone number). ANAM Alphabetic and numeric characters from a standard 101/102 keyboard except commas, square brackets, backslashes and quotation marks (“). Leading and trailing spaces must be trimmed; embedded spaces left as is; all spaces are invalid. PDEC Money in cents. The number should be a non-negative decimal integer. For example, if the amount is $547.98, the output format should be ‘54798’. No padding is required. Nil values should be represented by zero, i.e. 0. CURR Money in cents; the decimal point is implied; the number can be positive or negative. E.g. $102.67 is entered as 10267 DATE Any valid date in the format CCYYMMDD. IRD A valid 9 digit IRD number. It must be modulus 11 checked (see IRD number validation). Note that IRD numbers can contain eight or nine digits. From June 2008, IR introduced an extended number range for IRD numbers to include a new 9 digit range. When entering eight digit IRD numbers, you will need to add a leading zero (0), or they will be rejected by the data validation check. RANGE This field may only contain the values within the given range. Blank values must have a format of comma comma, i.e. ,, EMAIL This field will contain the email address. Email addresses must follow the RFC 5322 email standard. The full technical specification for this standard can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322 Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 51 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.3 Inland Revenue (IRD) Number validation The IRD number format used by Inland Revenue is an eight or nine digit number consisting of the following parts - • A seven or eight digit base number • A trailing check digit Check digit validation The following steps are to be performed - 1. Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range, or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4. Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 52 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. Re-calculate the check digit : • To each of the base number’s eight digits a secondary weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 6. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0 then subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is 10, the IRD number is invalid. 5. Compare the check digit : • Compare the calculated check digit to the last digit of the original IRD number. If they match, the IRD number is valid. Example 1 IR number 49091850. The base number is 4909185 and the supplied check digit is 0. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (1\*4) + (8\*3) + (5\*2) = 154. 154 / 11 = 14 remainder 0 (i.e. mod (154,11) = 0) The remainder (0) = check digit (0), so no further calculation is necessary. Example 2 IR number 35901981. The base number is 3590198 and the supplied check digit is 1. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (3\*2) + (5\*7) + (9\*6) + (0\*5) + (1\*4) + (9\*3) + (8\*2) = 142. 142 / 11 = 12 remainder 10 (i.e. mod (142,11) = 10) 11 – 10 = 1 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 3 IR number 49098576. The base number is 4909857 and the supplied check digit is 6. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (8\*4) + (5\*3) + (7\*2) = 177 . 177 / 11 = 16 remainder 1 (i.e. mod(177,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (0\*7) + (4\*4) + (9\*3) + (0\*2) + (9\*5) + (8\*2) + (5\*7) + (7\*6) = 181 181 / 11 = 16 remainder 5 (i.e. mod(181,11) = 5) 11 – 5 = 6, this matches the check digit. The number is valid. Investment Income Reporting File Upload Specification V1.5 53 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 4 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410132. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 2. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 5 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410133. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 3. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation. The number is invalid.

[Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19/remedial-amendments "Remedial amendments to the Portfolio Investment Entity tax rules")

Investor return adjustment in section HL 7 can apply for an investor's interest in a portfolio investor class or their interest in a different class
====================================================================================================================================================

2007 amendment allows portfolio tax rate entities to perform investor return adjustments to reflect the effect of the investor's portfolio investor rate.

Section HL 7 has been amended to allow a portfolio tax rate entity to perform an investor return adjustment to reflect the effect of the investor's portfolio investor rate as a member of a portfolio investor class.  Previously, the investor return adjustment had to be performed for the investor's interest in the entity as a whole.

It should be noted, however, that a portfolio tax rate entity still has the flexibility to perform the investor return adjustment to whatever portfolio investor interest of the investor that the entity considers is required.  This is because, under the amended section HL 7(3), the entity can adjust the investor's portfolio investor interest in the relevant class, or their interest in another class.  This means that a portfolio tax rate entity can adjust an investor's interest in any way it sees fit to reflect the tax paid.  This change, like the changes to section HL 20 and the tax credits provisions (described below), provides greater flexibility for portfolio tax rate entities.

Remedial changes to section HL 7(3) provide that the investor return adjustment must be made within two months of the end of the tax year, if the entity has made an election to pay tax under section HL 23.

The legislation allows the investor return adjustment to be made more frequently than within two months of the end of a calculation period or a tax year (depending on the type of portfolio tax rate entity).  Section HL 7(3) specifies the maximum timeframe for making the return adjustment.  It is not intended to preclude an entity making adjustments to investor interests earlier, if this is desired from a commercial perspective.

#### Allocation of portfolio investor allocated income to zero-rated portfolio investors aligned with investor's income year

Previously, investors in portfolio tax rate entities that are zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates were treated as deriving portfolio investor allocated income (or loss) in an income year, if the relevant income allocation period fell within their income year.  Portfolio tax rate entities that pay tax under sections HL 21 and HL 23 must operate on a 31 March tax year basis.  This could have resulted in zero-rated portfolio investors having to return income for two tax years of the entity, in their income year.

For example, an investor with a 30 June balance date would have needed to include all portfolio investor allocated income derived between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2009 in their 2008-09 tax return.  In contrast, the 2008-09 tax year for the portfolio tax rate entity would be from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009.  The investor would therefore need to include their share of the income in the entity's 2009-10 tax year as well (the three months from 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2009).  However, income information for the 2009-10 tax year would not be communicated to the investor until 30 June 2010 and would not separately identify the 1 April to 30 June income.

Sections CP 1 and HL 24 have been amended so that zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates only derive in an income year an amount of portfolio investor allocated income from a portfolio tax rate entity that relates to the portfolio allocation periods in the entity's income year that end in the investor's income year.

Similarly, zero-rated portfolio investors with non-standard balance dates only have in an income year an amount of portfolio investor allocated loss, in relation to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, that relates to the portfolio allocation periods in the entity's income year that end in the investor's income year.  No portfolio investor allocated loss arises in relation to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 22.

Amendments have also been made to section HL 27 to ensure that the allocation of foreign and New Zealand tax credits matches the allocation of the income for  
non-standard balance date zero-rated investors.

Under these changes, the investor in the example above would only be treated as deriving in their 2008-09 income year (the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009) the portfolio investor allocated income or loss that relates to the portfolio tax rate entity's 2008-09 tax year (1 April 2008 to 30 March 2009).  Any portfolio investor allocated income relating to the period 1 April 2009 to 30 June 2009 would not be included in the investor's return of income for 2008-09, as this relates to the portfolio tax rate entity's 2009-10 tax year.  Similarly, only the investor's share of New Zealand and foreign tax credits that relate to the portfolio tax rate entity's 2008-09 tax year would be available as a credit in the investor's 2008-09 income year.

#### Foreign tax credits

Consistent with the changes to sections HL 20 and HL 7, section HL 27 has been amended so that tax credits (both foreign and New Zealand) are allocated to an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class, and are able to be used by a portfolio tax rate entity to reduce the investor's portfolio entity tax liability relating to the portfolio investor class.  In the case of foreign tax credits, depending on whether application of foreign tax credits is restricted to the tax liability of an investor as a member of a specific portfolio investor class or all portfolio investor classes the investor has an interest in, a different tax result may arise. 

A number of amendments have been made to add greater flexibility to the way a portfolio tax rate entity (particularly entities that pay tax under section HL 23) can use tax credits.  The provisions do not remove other options available under the portfolio investment entity  
tax rules.

Under section HL 27(3), foreign tax credits are allocated for each portfolio allocation period (for example, a day) to each investor as a member of a portfolio investor class.  The amount of foreign tax credit allocated is based on the investor's share (that is, the investor fraction) of the class's share of the foreign income which gives rise to the credit.

Foreign tax credits can only be used by a portfolio tax rate entity to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor to which they have been allocated.  Therefore, a portfolio tax rate entity must track foreign tax credits allocated to each investor in a tax year.  This is also necessary because an investor who exits a portfolio investor class during the tax year, but re-enters the class in a future period within the same year, should be able to get the benefit of any foreign tax credit not previously used.

The allocation of foreign tax credits to investors (which will occur daily in most cases), and the ability of a portfolio tax rate entity to use the credits to pay the portfolio entity tax liability for an investor, should be distinguished.  The ability for a portfolio tax rate entity to use foreign tax credits is given under section HL 27(10).  Similarly, if the investor is a zero-rated portfolio investor, section HL 27(7) governs the ability of the investor to use foreign tax credits to reduce the tax liability on their portfolio investor allocated income.  A number of changes have been made to these sections.  These are discussed in greater detail below.

##### **Foreign tax credits can be used to reduce a portfolio entity tax liability for any portfolio investor class of the investor**

Foreign tax credits allocated to an investor as a member of a portfolio investor class can be used by a portfolio tax rate entity as a credit against income tax payable by the entity for the investor as a member of that class.  Under the amendments to section HL 27(10), a portfolio tax rate entity can also use foreign tax credits that have been allocated to the investor as a member of one portfolio investor class, to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the investor for another portfolio investor class.

Therefore, amended section HL 27(10) gives flexibility to portfolio tax rate entities in the way that they make use of foreign tax credits allocated to investors.  If foreign tax credits can be used across different portfolio investor classes of the same investor, rather than just to reduce the portfolio entity tax liability of the class that gives rise to the credit, a different tax result will arise.  Example 2 illustrates.

If an entity chooses to use foreign tax credits allocated to an investor only against the portfolio entity tax liability of the portfolio investor class which gives rise to the credit, the total portfolio entity tax liability for Class A would be $0 (and no foreign tax credit would be able to be used).  For Class B, a liability of $25 with an available credit of only $10 would arise.  On the other hand, if the portfolio tax rate entity chooses to utilise the credits available to the investor as a member of both Class A and Class B to reduce the aggregate tax liability for the investor, the liability would be $25, with total available foreign tax credits of $15.  In this case, the investor would benefit from having an extra $5 of tax credit.

#### Example 2

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Class A** | **Class B** |
| **Day 1** | PETL = $10   (FTC = $5) | PETL = $15   (FTC = $10) |
| **Day 2** | PETL = -$10   (FTC = $0) | PETL = $10    (FTC = $0) |

The above result would be an absolute tax difference, rather than a tax timing difference, as any excess foreign tax credits are forfeited at the end of a tax year.  In other circumstances, a class approach to utilising foreign tax credits may be more beneficial - for example, where the overall entity result for the investor is a loss but they have foreign tax credits allocated to investment classes that are profitable. 

The amended legislation allows both approaches outlined above, to provide greater flexibility to portfolio tax rate entities.

New section HL 27(10B) outlines the amount of foreign tax credit that is available to be used in a portfolio calculation period to reduce an investor's portfolio entity tax liability as a member of the portfolio investor class that gives rise to the credit, or as a member of another portfolio investor class.

The amount of the credit is the lesser of available allocated foreign tax credits (excluding credits used in previous calculation periods) and the amount of the investor's portfolio entity tax liability (again, excluding credits used to meet tax liabilities in previous periods).

##### **Foreign tax credits allowed to be carried back to reduce a portfolio entity tax liability of an investor in previous portfolio calculation periods**

The amendments to section HL 27 ensure that foreign tax credits can be used for the benefit of an individual investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 23, in a tax year, irrespective of the portfolio calculation period in which they arise.

Under the changes, a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 22 or HL 23 can use foreign tax credits to reduce an investor's portfolio entity tax liability in the portfolio calculation period in which the credit is allocated and earlier portfolio calculation periods in the same tax year.

This effectively allows foreign tax credits allocated to an investor to be carried back (as well as forward) to previous allocation periods in the tax year.  This provides a more consistent income year approach to the use of foreign tax credits by a portfolio tax rate entity, rather than use of the credits being limited to the day in which they arise and any future period.  Any foreign tax credits unable to be used at the end of the tax year would, as previously, be forfeited.  

A broadly similar approach applies to a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 - the main difference being that foreign tax credits can only be carried back within a portfolio calculation period.

##### **Foreign tax credits allocated to zero-rated investors**

Under the amended section HL 27(7), foreign tax credits that are allocated to investors in a portfolio tax rate entity that are themselves portfolio tax rate entities can be used by these investor entities without restriction.

This allows such investors to flow-through the allocated foreign tax credits to their investors each day.  Previously, all zero-rated investors in portfolio tax rate entities were restricted to the lesser of the allocated foreign tax credit or the entity's share of the portfolio investor allocated income multiplied by the entity's basic tax rate for the relevant tax year.  This is no longer the case for investors in portfolio tax rate entities that are themselves portfolio tax rate entities.

Section HL 27(8) has been amended to deal with foreign tax credits allocated to zero-rated investors that are not portfolio tax rate entities.  For these investors the maximum the investor can use in their income year is the lesser of the amount of the credit that is allocated or:

*   for an investor with a portfolio investor exit period in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21, the amount calculated by multiplying the investor's portfolio investor rate by their portfolio investor allocated income for the exit period;
*   for a zero-rated portfolio investor in a portfolio tax rate entity that pays tax under section HL 21 or HL 23, the amount calculated by multiplying the basic statutory rate of tax for the investor by their portfolio investor allocated income for the tax year.

As noted earlier, amendments have also been made to align the foreign tax credits allocated in a tax year of the portfolio tax rate entity to the income year of zero-rated investors with non-standard balance dates.

IR cases in the courts
======================

**18 September 2019**

Working with customers to get their tax right is IR’s preferred approach. However, when all other avenues fail, we consider taking prosecution action.

IR has more than 90 cases before the courts as of the end of June and sentences have been handed down over recent months for tax evasion and other offences.

Tax cases receive more media attention each year reflecting public concern about appropriate action being taken when taxpayers break the law. Here are tax cases Inland Revenue has taken through the courts to sentencing in recent months.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Peter G Lochead**

A Christchurch man has been sentenced to 7.5 months home detention and 120 hours community work on one representative charge of aiding and abetting another person in their failure to account to the Commissioner for tax deductions made from employees’ wages. 

Lochead was the sole director/shareholder of an engineering services company which went in to voluntary liquidation in 2017 owing $461,803.34 to Inland Revenue. The company had failed to account for $122,734.85 of PAYE deductions for 11 months.

His tax agent and business advisor confirmed Lochead would have paid trade creditors and wages in preference to Inland revenue and other creditors.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Allan David Gilmour**

An Auckland carpet layer has been fined for not filing GST and PAYE returns.

Allan David Gilmour was sentenced in the Manukau District Court and fined $4,600 and ordered to pay $130 court costs.

Gilmour faced 23 charges. For three years he didn’t file income tax returns and from September 2015 until September 2018 he didn’t file GST returns.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Lesley Marie Keriana Waaka**

An Auckland woman with a fictitious gift basket business, who fabricated data in GST returns, has been sentenced to 8 months home detention.

Lesley Marie Keriana Waaka also used forged bank statements to try to justify her GST refund claims.

The company she set up never had actual taxable activity and was used by Waaka as a vehicle to claim fraudulent GST returns. The court heard her offending was pre-meditated and persistent.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Lute Tonga Vailolo**

Lute Tonga Vailolo was sentenced to 11 months home detention. [https://www.media.ird.govt.nz/articles/false-gst-and-income-tax-claims-lead-to-home-detention/](articles/false-gst-and-income-tax-claims-lead-to-home-detention/)

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Lee Hinehou Hare**

A former New Plymouth company director who used forged documents to try get GST refunds she wasn’t entitled to has been sentenced to community detention for tax fraud. [https://www.media.ird.govt.nz/articles/community-detention-for-tax-fraud/](articles/community-detention-for-tax-fraud/)

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V T A George Jones**

A 78-year-old former director of several Christchurch hospitality businesses was sentenced to six months home detention when he appeared in court in August.

George Jones ran the businesses with his son [https://www.media.ird.govt.nz/articles/christchurch-businessman-sentenced-to-home-detention/](articles/christchurch-businessman-sentenced-to-home-detention/)

He faced 7 representative charges of aiding and abetting his son in making tax deductions from staff wages while not intending to pass them on to IR. He’s an experienced director and has led 39 companies since 1993.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Satend Kumar Ram**

An Auckland builder has been fined $5,800 and $520 (130 x 4) court costs for failing to fill in PAYE, GST and income tax returns. 

Satend Kumar Ram faced 29 charges of aiding and abetting Brim Construction in failing to file tax.

Mr Ram should have the filed:

• Monthly PAYE schedules from September 2017 to February 2019,

• GST periods between July 2017 to November 2018 and January 2019, and

• Income tax for the year ending 31 March 2018.

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Tony Edward Cree**

Tony Edward Cree was sentenced to 3 years in prison.  [https://www.media.ird.govt.nz/articles/false-tax-refund-claims-send-man-to-prison/](articles/false-tax-refund-claims-send-man-to-prison/)

**Commissioner of Inland Revenue V Mark Glanville Thompson**

Former company director Mark Glanville Thompson was sentenced to 3 months community detention when he appeared for sentence in Auckland in July.

Thompson aided and abetted a company in liquidation to collect PAYE, child support payments, KiwiSaver, student loan and superannuation deductions but didn’t pass them on to IR.

They totalled $142,501.83. The company, Stonex Systems, failed to account for employer deductions for over a year. Thompson was the sole director and was in control of payments to Inland Revenue.

IR Easter shutdown for system changes – Covid-19 support will continue
======================================================================

**06 April 2020**

Inland Revenue (IR) will turn off its computer systems for seven days from this Thursday to implement the latest round of planned transformation changes.

All phone and online services will be unavailable from 3pm on 9 April until 16 April. That includes two business days – April 14 and 15.

IR’s deputy commissioner change, Greg James, said that in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, it was important for New Zealanders to know that IR would continue, over the shutdown period, to support the Ministry of Social Development in approving wage subsidy applications, and would continue to make all expected payments, including Working for Families payments.

“In a difficult time such as this, helping people get what they need as quickly as we can, remains our top priority,” he said, “and making these changes now significantly improves our ability to deliver Covid-19 tax measures over the coming weeks and months.

“The transformation changes will further simplify tax requirements, reduce effort, improve services and allow customers to do more for themselves.

“And it will increase our ability to respond swiftly to any Covid-19 related developments and to any other crisis situations that might occur in the future,” he said.

However, Mr James acknowledged that making the changes now could increase the risk of service disruptions in the short term, if things did not go completely smoothly.

“We will be managing some short-term disruption,” he said, “in order to get the immediate and long-term benefits for New Zealanders.

“We have carefully considered our options in this,” he said, ‘but we can’t know what the risks involved in delaying and choosing some future date are because we don’t know what will be happening in the economy then. So not making these changes now would mean delaying the benefits to New Zealand, without necessarily reducing the risk.

Mr James said IR was well prepared, with a dedicated team in place to identify and resolve any issues quickly.

While myIR will not be functioning, the IRD website content will still be accessible.

**Additional information**

**Covid-19: important points for businesses:**

• Any Employment Information files due during this time can be filed on 17 April instead. 

• Inland Revenue will write-off any penalties and interest for businesses unable to pay taxes on time due to the impact of COVID-19. Don’t worry about contacting us right now. Get in touch with us when you can.

• To help get correct payments to people we would like employers to still file their returns as normal. This helps us work out the right amounts for people and helps the Government continue to respond to what is happening in the economy.

**IR’s latest changes - immediate and long-term benefits:**

• These changes will help ensure the automatic issuing of income tax assessments runs more smoothly. This is even more important for customers this year.

• For all dealings with Inland Revenue (except child support and paid parental leave for now) people will be able to do more for themselves and apply for help if they need it through myIR.

• IR will exchange information with KiwiSaver scheme providers much more quickly, meaning that customers’ accounts will be more up to date. The Government guarantee of employer contributions can only be implemented in our new system, START. This is more important than ever in the current environment.

• Any customer experiencing difficulties will be able to apply for relief through a simple, new myIR service. Currently they have to ring us or fill in a form.

• Borrowers who are struggling to repay their student loans will be able to apply for a special deduction rate online. Currently, they have to ring or write to us.

• These new services will make it easier for customers to get the help they need and will help to ensure their payment obligations reflect their current income.

• KiwiSaver and Student Loan information will be processed more quickly and will be more accurate.   Improved self-service options will enable Student Loan borrowers to manage their loans more easily themselves and will provide KiwiSaver members with better information about their contributions and now, do more for themselves.

• Inland Revenue will share Student Loan information with other government agencies more quickly and efficiently.

• Employers will be able to manage all their information and obligations in one account and will have a consolidated view of all the deductions they make on behalf of their employees.

• Employers will be able to set up instalment arrangements themselves online for any debt they owe instead of having to call us.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Ministerial Response to the Petition of Alisha Riley on Increase the GST threshold Proposal 1This paper seeks approval of the Minister of Revenue’s response to the Petitions Committee’s referral of the Petition of Alisha Riley. Background 2The Petition of Alisha Riley was presented to the House on 23 February 2024. 3The petition requests that the House of Representatives urge the Government to increase the GST registration threshold in its 2024 tax policy work programme. 4The petitioner proposes increasing the GST registration threshold from $60,000 to $130,800. This figure was derived by calculating the proportional increase in the minimum wage since GST was introduced in 1986. 5The petitioner also provided a written submission to support their petition. The submission outlines the petitioner’s argument that wage inflation is the main driver of expenses for low GST input businesses, and consequently these businesses are adversely impacted by the existing GST registration threshold. 6The Petitions Committee has also requested the Minister of Revenue consider and comment on the possibility of legislation or a regulation that would allow the GST threshold to be updated on an annual basis in line with inflation. Comment on petition’s request and Ministerial response 7On 11 March 2024, the Petitions Committee referred the petition to a Minister for response. 8Upon reflection, I recommend the GST registration threshold is not increased at this time. Increasing the registration threshold would likely have consequences for other small and medium sized businesses and would likely impose a significant fiscal cost. 9Currently, businesses with an annual turnover of $60,000 or more are required to be registered for GST. They are required to charge and collect GST on their sales, and they can claim back GST they have paid on their business costs. 10 The purpose of the registration threshold is to strike a balance between applying a broad-based GST system to almost all forms of consumption, not distorting business competition, and ensuring compliance costs are minimised where possible (especially 1 3yj46e8jvz 2024-05-21 08:34:34 Item 01 for small businesses). While inflation may be indirectly considered when evaluating the impact of compliance costs, inflation or changes to the minimum wage are not explicitly considered when setting the registration threshold. 11 New Zealand’s GST system is highly regarded internationally, in part, because it broadly applies to a wide range of goods and services with very few exemptions. The GST system’s broad base means there is a reduced risk of market distortion between GST registered and GST unregistered suppliers, as it’s likely sale prices are subject to GST. Increasing the registration threshold to $130,800 would narrow the GST base because it would apply to fewer goods and services sold in New Zealand. Furthermore, the costs of complying with GST have decreased for small businesses since the threshold was last increased in 2009. 12 There are concerns that adjusting the registration threshold annually may drive commercial behaviour and interfere with natural business growth. This is because some unregistered businesses whose annual turnover is approaching the registration threshold may choose to reduce their growth in the understanding they will remain under the increased threshold for another 12 months. 13 In the 2023 calendar year, GST registered taxpayers with an annual turnover between $60,000 and $130,800 accounted for approximately $463.38 million of GST collected (or 1.7% of total GST collected). Although it is unlikely that all taxpayers would consequently deregister if the registration threshold was increased, these figures provide an indication of the potential impact if taxpayers were otherwise able to delay registering for GST. 14Although adjusting the registration threshold by only inflation or minimum wage would not be the most appropriate methodology, as they do not take into account the considerations noted above, inflation would be the more appropriate measure given it relates to a broader range of costs for all businesses. When GST was introduced in 1986, the registration threshold was $24,000. If the original threshold was inflation- adjusted to March 2024, it would be approximately $65,774. 15 Micro and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face the highest compliance costs relative to the amount of tax paid by them. There are several potential policy initiatives which seek to remove barriers and reduce compliance costs for SME taxpayers. These will be considered for prioritisation as part of setting the Government’s Tax and Social Policy Work Programme. Timing of the response 16 The Ministerial response must be presented to the House by 5 June 2024, in accordance with Standing Order 380. Consultation 17 This Cabinet paper was prepared by Inland Revenue. Treasury was informed of this Cabinet paper. 2 3yj46e8jvz 2024-05-21 08:34:34 Communications 18 The Minister of Revenue will present the Minister’s response to the petition in the House of Representatives. No further publicity is required. Proactive Release 19 The Minister proposes to release this paper proactively following the presentation of the Ministerial response. 3 3yj46e8jvz 2024-05-21 08:34:34 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1note that on 11 March 2024 the Petitions Committee referred the Petition of Alisha Riley to a Minister for response; 2note the petitioner’s request, that the Government increases the GST registration threshold to $130,800; 3note the submission of the Minister of Revenue and in particular their advice that the GST registration threshold should not be increased, as a higher registration threshold would likely have consequences for other small and medium sized businesses and would likely impose a significant fiscal cost; 4approve the Ministerial response to the Petition of Alisha Riley, attached to this submission; 5note that the Ministerial response must be presented to the House by 5 June 2024; 6invite the Minister of Revenue to present the Ministerial response to the House in accordance with Standing Order 380; 7invite the Minister of Revenue to write to the petitioner enclosing a copy of the Ministerial response to the petition, after the response has been presented to the House.

\
5.1 The Solicitor-General is ultimately responsible for the conduct of all litigation in the name of the Commissioner.

It is expected that most disagreements will be resolved at or below the level of the Team Leader of the Tax and Commercial Team in Crown Law and the Director of the Litigation Management Unit in Inland Revenue. Only difficult and important matters are expected to be escalated to the level of Deputy Solicitor-General/Deputy Commissioner. Ultimately the SolicitorGeneral, after consultation with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, will resolve any outstanding issue over the conduct of litigation.\
\
The Solicitor-General is ultimately responsible for determining which counsel will represent the Commissioner. In practice, the Team Leader of the Tax and Commercial Team in Crown Law will make those decisions up to High Court level, the Deputy Solicitor-General at Court of Appeal level, and the Solicitor-General at Supreme Court level.

The Solicitor-General may withdraw his approval at any stage in a particular case.\
\
The settlement of cases in litigation (other than debt matters and summary prosecutions in which Inland Revenue solicitors represent the Commissioner) will be jointly approved by Crown Law and Inland Revenue. This reflects the respective obligations and responsibilities of the Commissioner under s 6 and 6A Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Solicitor-General as summarised in paragraph 1.1 above. In the event that joint agreement cannot be reached the escalation process set out in paragraph 5.1 will be followed.\
\
5.5 Counsel appointed by the Solicitor-General to represent the Commissioner are responsible for what legal arguments are put to the Court, subject to the views of the Solicitor-General. Counsel will ensure that proposed submissions are fully discussed with Inland Revenue whose views on the proposed submission will be carefully considered and followed unless there are good reasons for not doing so. In the event of a dispute about proposed submissions, that dispute will ultimately be resolved by the Solicitor-General if the dispute is unable to be resolved through dialogue between Crown Law and Inland Revenue.\
\
5.6 Counsel appointed by the Solicitor-General to represent the Commissioner will be responsible for ensuring that the Crown's discovery obligations are discharged.\
\
All communication with the Court must be authorised by counsel appointed by the Solicitor-General to represent the Commissioner.\
\
Crown Law will communicate with Inland Revenue on litigation matters through Inland Revenue's Litigation Management Unit in the first instance. The Litigation Management Unit will, in the first instance, be responsible for communication over litigation matters with other parts of Inland Revenue. Crown Law will advise Litigation Management Unit of any Inland Revenue matter that has not come through the Unit or other approved channel.\
\
# 6\. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP MEETINGS\
\
6.1 The Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue will ensure that appropriate fora exist between Crown Law and Inland Revenue to ensure the effective functioning of the relationships between the two Organisations.\
\
# RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXTERNAL PARTIES\
\
6.2 The Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue recognise that their complementary roles should be explained to the broader community through joint communications.

Subject to your agreement, the Cabinet paper should be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 20 June 2024, so that it may be considered by the Cabinet Business Committee at its meeting on 1 July 2024. Background 4.Pension transfers to New Zealand, when made outside our four-year transitional residency period, result in New Zealand tax payable at an individual’s marginal rate on some of the lump sum transferred. The tax applies only to the amount of income derived by the pension fund (ie, fund growth) after the person became New Zealand tax resident or after their transitional period ended (where applicable). In some cases, the amount of tax payable can be substantial, such as when a person transfers a sizable pension many years after becoming New Zealand resident. Transfers to New Zealand: introduction of a “scheme pays” mechanism 5.The United Kingdom’s (UK) pensions rules are strict. Transfers of pension funds outside the UK are only permitted in limited circumstances, one being where the receiving scheme is a Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme (QROPS) under UK rules. Broadly, QROPS are schemes that must comply with the UK’s rules for pension schemes. These include a rule that disallows withdrawal from the fund before the UK’s minimum retirement age (currently 55). 6.The UK rules mean that individuals who withdraw from either their UK pension fund or the receiving QROPS fund to pay the New Zealand tax bill, may incur a UK unauthorised payment charge of up to 55%. This means the tax must be paid out of pocket by the individual. This creates a barrier to transfers and has caused hardship for some individuals. 7.To resolve this issue, we recommend that a “scheme pays” mechanism is introduced. This would make the New Zealand transfer tax a liability of the New Zealand QROPS rather than the individual. “Scheme pays” would allow the New Zealand QROPS to report the transfer to Inland Revenue and pay the tax due directly from the individuals transferred pension funds (meaning the individual would not need to pay the tax). This mechanism is acceptable to the UK’s His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is also used in Australia to address this problem. IR2024/251 : Cabinet paper – Qualified recognised overseas pension schemes Page 2 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8.We recommend that it is mandatory for QROPS to offer “scheme pays” and that the following features apply: 8.1 The individual will choose whether they, or the scheme, pays the tax due. 8.2 Regardless of the option the individual chooses, the QROPS will be responsible for a monthly digital report of transferred funds. The report should be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and will include details such as the individual’s name and IRD number, the amount being transferred and the taxable amount, and whether the scheme will pay the tax. Option 1: Scheme pays 8.3 If the individual chooses “scheme pays”, the QROPS will withhold tax at a flat rate of 28% and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. Option 2: Pay as an individual 8.4 If the individual chooses to pay the tax themselves, the standard rules will apply, meaning that the person will pay tax at their marginal rate. Inland Revenue will use the information supplied to pre-populate the individual’s MyIR account; they will either: 8.4.1 pay the tax due as part of the year-end automatic calculation process, or 8.4.2 file their IR 3 self-assessment return and pay the tax (in keeping with the current rules). 9.Increased reporting of pension transfers received in New Zealand may assist in addressing some concerns raised about potential misunderstanding of, and non- compliance with, New Zealand’s tax rules. 10.During targeted consultation some submitters preferred using the individual’s prescribed investor rate (PIR) to calculate the tax. A PIR is the rate at which an investor pays tax on their taxable income from a portfolio investment entity (PIE). Although many QROPS are structured as PIEs we preferred a flat rate because: 10.1 If the correct PIR is not used, then a year-end “wash up” will result in the individual needing to fund the payment of the additional tax, or receiving a refund of tax or credit against other taxes. 10.2 HMRC’s rules prohibit the individual from accessing the QROPS fund, meaning that it will not be possible for any excess amounts to be repaid to the individual. 10.3 For most transferees, the 28% rate provides certainty and prevents the transferred funds from being taxed at marginal rates. This means that the transferred lump sum will not be pushed into an artificially high tax bracket. 10.4 An individual who seeks the benefit of the lower bands may still choose to pay and file under the present system. 10.5 A flat rate system is administratively simple and cost effective relative to the affected population. Other designs will necessarily require greater complexity and cost. IR2024/251 : Cabinet paper – Qualified recognised overseas pension schemes Page 3 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 11.We intend that relevant error and correction provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to reporting, withholding and paying of tax due. 12.To ensure that transfers from the UK and elsewhere are treated equally, we recommend that this design applies to all transfers of pension funds to New Zealand pension providers. 1 13.Appropriate guardrails will be required both to ensure that the new rules apply only to transfers to New Zealand fund providers (as opposed to withdrawals from overseas fund providers, which should be taxable at marginal rates) and to prevent schemes being left liable for incorrect or incomplete information or without funds to pay the tax due. 14.We do not anticipate more than minor changes in the detailed design phase. However, there are boutique providers in the market for whom the cost of changing or developing systems may be higher than it is for larger players offering a PIE. Application date 15.We recommend that “scheme pays” applies from is introduced from 1 April 2026. This will ensure sufficient time to implement system changes and prepare QROPS and scheme providers for the implementation of “scheme pays”. There is a risk that an earlier date of 1 April 2025 would not allow providers adequate time to make the necessary changes. “Locked-in” KiwiSaver schemes 16.On 17 June 2015, HMRC tightened the QROPS criteria so that any overseas pension scheme allowing withdrawal before the age of 55 could not qualify. This caused KiwiSaver schemes (which allow earlier withdrawals in various circumstances such as hardship), to lose their QROPS status. Grandparenting treatment was applied to the retirement funds of migrants who made the transfer to a KiwiSaver scheme before 17 June 2015. However, they could not subsequently transfer their funds to another KiwiSaver scheme without incurring a UK tax charge. This means they were effectively “locked in” to their current KiwiSaver provider. This also causes problems when a provider planned to merge KiwiSaver schemes with low participation. 17.The UK tax charge applies only for five full UK tax years after the migrant lost their UK tax residence (it was later increased to 10 years, but this is not relevant for historic transfers). Without complicating factors that may arise in individual cases, for most individuals this period expired on 6 April 2021. Nevertheless, legacy cases remain. In addition, certain UK tax reporting requirements apply to former QROPS. Affected scheme providers seek changes to the rules to promote flexibility. 18.We recommend that the KiwiSaver rules be changed to allow “locked-in” UK retirement savings to be transferred from KiwiSaver schemes into another New Zealand QROPS with the consent of the individual member. This would allow the remaining balance of the KiwiSaver account to be managed without UK tax implications. HMRC has confirmed that this solution would be effective. We recommend this change applies from 1 April 2025. Consultation 19.We undertook three rounds of targeted consultation with QROPS providers as well as industry and professional bodies including Chartered Accountants Australia and 1 Noting that transfers between Australian superannuation funds and KiwiSaver funds are treated differently under the Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability scheme. We intend this scheme to be unaffected by the proposed new rules. IR2024/251 : Cabinet paper – Qualified recognised overseas pension schemes Page 4 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] New Zealand, Certified Practising Accountants Australia, and the Financial Services Council. 20.All submitters supported the introduction of a “scheme pays” option for QROPS though some preferred using the individual’s PIR over a flat rate (see paragraph 32 above). Others were concerned about the extension of the proposal to non-QROPS and the necessary time for implementation. A selection of QROPS providers also supported resolution of the “locked-in” KiwiSaver issue, though the majority made no comment. 21.We also consulted the Financial Markets Authority and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment who were comfortable with these proposals. 22.A Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared for the Qualified Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes policy measures and is attached to the draft Cabinet Paper. The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has determined that this Regulatory Impact Statement meets the quality assurance criteria. Administrative implications 23.The introduction of “scheme pays” is expected to have an administrative implementation cost of $1.700 million capital and $0.800 million operating. Ongoing costs (depreciation and capital costs) will be $0.795 million over the 2024/25 to 2027/28 years. Inland Revenue will absorb this cost within existing baselines, noting that there is a limit to the level of initiatives that the department can absorb. The release of “locked-in” KiwiSavers is not expected to have any administrative impact. $ million – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 & outyears Total Capital costs System build – – 1.700 – – 1.700 Total capital (debt) impact – – 1.700 – – 1.700 Operating costs System build – – 0.800 – – 0.800 Depreciation – – 0.100 0.240 0.240 0.580 Capital charge – – 0.045 0.085 0.085 0.215 Total operating impact – – 0.945 0.325 0.325 0.795 Financial implications 24.The proposed introduction of “scheme pays” will have a negative impact on tax revenue with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (1.600) Total operating 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.600 IR2024/251 : Cabinet paper – Qualified recognised overseas pension schemes Page 5 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2028/29 2029/30 2030/31 2031/32 2032/33 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.900) (0.900) (1. 000) (1.100) (1.100) Total operating 0.900 0.900 1.000 1.100 1.100 25.The proposed amendment for “locked-in” KiwiSavers has no fiscal implications.

Background 2.You previously reviewed the Cabinet paper for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024- 25, Emergency Response and Remedial Measures) Bill and agreed with the recommendations in the cover report \[IR2024/177\] (the cover report). That report set out the background on the QROPS “scheme pays” proposal. 3.In essence, “scheme pays” would enable New Zealand pension scheme providers to report and pay New Zealand tax due on the taxable portion of a transferred overseas pension fund directly to Inland Revenue. This would resolve the issue for migrants from the United Kingdom (UK) who cannot withdraw from the fund to pay New Zealand tax under UK rules, but who struggle to make the payment from personal sources. Conflict of interest 4.Following your agreement to the recommendations in the cover report, the Cabinet Office confirmed that the Minister of Revenue has a conflict of interest concerning the QROPS proposal. A nother Minister will be delegated to take the QROPS Cabinet paper to the Cabinet Business Committee on 8 July 2024 and Cabinet on 15 July 2024. 5.We have therefore prepared a Cabinet paper for QROPS (the draft Cabinet paper) which is attached for your information. This paper contains the same information as the paper you have already seen, except for updates relating to a change in the application date, as outlined below. Proposed change of application date for “scheme pays” 6.In the cover report we recommended that “scheme pays” apply from 1 April 2025, with provision for an optional later application date, on the basis that some scheme providers might require more time to prepare. However, following further discussions at Inland Revenue, we now recommend that “scheme pays” instead apply from 1 April 2026, with no provision for a later application date (an optional later application date should not be necessary given the deferred starting date). IR2024/265 : QROPS – Change to proposed application date for “scheme pays” Page 2 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7.Inland Revenue’s operational team has indicated that a 1 April 2026 application date would allow sufficient time for all scheme providers to update their systems to accommodate “scheme pays”. Setting this date would allow Inland Revenue to collaborate effectively on detailed design with providers on changes to systems and processes providing greater certainty. 8.The second proposal in the cover report (the “locked-in KiwiSaver” proposal) is unaffected by this change. Administrative implications 9.The change to the application date will have a minor effect on administrative costs. The implementation cost of $1.700 million capital and $0.800 million operating will be recognised a year later (in the 2025/26 year). Ongoing costs (depreciation and capital costs) will be $0.795 million over the 2025/26 to 2027/28 forecast period. Financial implications 10.The proposed introduction of “scheme pays” from 1 April 2026 will result in a minor change to the fiscal implications, reducing the fiscal cost from $2 million over the forecast period (2026/27 and 2027/28) to $1.6 million (2027/28). 11.As such, the revised proposal will have a reduced negative impact on tax revenue with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt as shown below: $m increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (1.600) Total operating 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.600 2028/29 2029/30 2030/31 2031/32 2032/33 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.900) (0.900) (1. 000) (1.100) (1.100) Total operating 0.900 0.900 1.000 1.100 1.100 Cons ultation 12.The Treasury was informed of the proposed application date change. Next steps 13.Following your agreement to this change, the draft Cabinet paper can be circulated for Ministerial consultation. 14.Following Ministerial consultation, the draft Cabinet paper will be finalised and provided to the Acting Minister of Revenue for lodgement by 10am, Thursday 4 July 2024. 15.The Cabinet paper and Regulatory Impact Statement will be considered at the Cabinet Business Committee meeting on Monday 8 July 2024 and at Cabinet on Monday 15 July 2024. 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of th e Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Business Committee QUALIFYING RECOGNISED OVERSEAS PENSION SCHEMES Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Business Committee’s agreement to two policy measures relating to qualifying recognised overseas pension schemes (QROPS) that require changes to tax legislation. 2 If approved, I propose including the necessary legislative amendments in the next omnibus taxation Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. Relation to Government priorities 3 These measures promote Government priorities by maintaining the integrity of the tax system and making it easier for taxpayers to meet their obligations. Executive summary 4 I recommend amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to give effect to a “scheme pays” mechanism for QROPS and other retirement savings transfers to New Zealand and to improve the flexibility of “locked-in” KiwiSavers. Financial implications 5 The “ scheme pays” proposal would be funded through the Tax Policy Scorecard mechanism (the Scorecard). 6 The Scorecard is a memorandum account that allows the fiscal impacts of tax policy changes to be offset against one another, rather than being managed through Budget allowances or the between-Budget contingency. Use of the Scorecard requires joint Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue agreement. The Minister of Finance and I have agreed to use of the Scorecard for this proposal. 7 The locked-in KiwiSaver proposal has no fiscal implications. b01w5dhx65 2024-07-11 11:49:28 Item 4 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 8 Pension transfers to New Zealand, when made outside our four-year transitional residency period, result in New Zealand tax payable at an individual’s marginal rate. The tax applies only to the amount of income derived by the pension fund (ie, fund growth) after the person became New Zealand tax resident or after their transitional period ended (where applicable). In some cases, the amount of tax payable can be substantial, such as when a person transfers a sizeable fund many years after becoming New Zealand resident. Retirement savings transfers to New Zealand: QROPS 9 The United Kingdom’s (UK) pensions rules are strict. Transfers of pension funds outside the UK are only permitted in limited circumstances, one being where the receiving scheme is a QROPS under UK rules. We understand that, in New Zealand, the majority of QROPS investments are in portfolio investment entities (PIEs). 10 Under UK tax rules, many individuals cannot withdraw from either their UK pension fund or the receiving QROPS fund to pay the New Zealand tax bill without incurring a UK unauthorised payment charge of up to 55%. The tax must be paid out of pocket by the individual. This creates a barrier to transfers and has caused hardship for some individuals. 11 I propose that a “scheme pays” mechanism is introduced. This would allow the New Zealand QROPS to report the transfer to Inland Revenue and pay the tax due directly from the individual’s transferred pension funds (meaning the individual would not need to pay the tax). This mechanism is acceptable to the UK’s His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is also used in Australia to address this problem. 12 I propose that it will be mandatory for a QROPS to offer a “scheme pays” option. The following features apply: 12.1 The individual will choose whether they personally pay, or the scheme pays, the tax due. 12.2 Regardless of the option the individual chooses, the QROPS will be responsible for a monthly digital report of transferred funds. The report should be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 12.3 If the individual chooses “scheme pays”, the QROPS will withhold tax at a flat rate of 28% (which is the top rate of tax for PIE investors) and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. Paying tax at a flat rate is much easier for Inland Revenue’s systems to administer, especially given the number of individuals likely to be affected. A flat rate avoids the problems that would arise if an incorrect tax rate was applied to the transfer, such as the risk of a refund to the individual in breach of UK rules. b01w5dhx65 2024-07-11 11:49:28 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12.4 If the individual chooses to “pay as an individual”, they will be required to return the income and pay the tax due at their marginal rate (in accordance with current rules). 13 All submitters supported the adoption of “scheme pays”, although some preferred the use of portfolio investment rates (PIRs) over a flat rate. However, the use of PIRs would impose an excessive administrative burden relative to the population size. 14 Increased reporting of pension transfers received in New Zealand may assist in addressing some concerns raised about potential misunderstanding of, and non-compliance with, New Zealand’s tax rules. 15 To ensure that the new rules work fairly and efficiently and to prevent schemes being left liable for incorrect or incomplete information or without funds to pay the tax due, appropriate conditions will apply to transfers under the “scheme pays” mechanism. In particular, the new rules should apply only to transfers to New Zealand fund providers (as opposed to withdrawals from fund providers, which should be taxable at marginal rates). 16 I propose that relevant error and correction provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 apply to reporting, withholding and paying tax due. 17 The introduction of “scheme pays” is expected to have an administrative implementation cost of $1.700 million capital and $0.800 million operating. Ongoing costs (depreciation and capital costs) will be $0.795 million over the 2024/25 to 2027/28 years. Inland Revenue will absorb this cost within existing baselines, noting that there is a limit to the level of initiatives that the department can absorb. The design of “scheme pays” contemplates leveraging existing systems and processes for investment income. More than minor changes to the detailed design may incur further costs and may require the application date to be extended. 18 The release of “locked-in” KiwiSavers is not expected to have any administrative impact. Retirement savings transfers to New Zealand: other jurisdictions 19 To ensure that transfers from the UK and elsewhere are treated equally, I propose that the ”scheme pays” design applies to all transfers of pension funds to New Zealand pension providers 1 . 1 Noting that transfers between Australian superannuation funds and KiwiSaver funds are treated differently under the Trans-Tasman retirement savings portability scheme. This scheme will not be affected by the proposed new rules. b01w5dhx65 2024-07-11 11:49:28 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] “Locked-in” KiwiSaver schemes 20 On 17 June 2015, HMRC tightened the QROPS criteria so that any overseas pension scheme allowing withdrawal before the age of 55 could not qualify. This caused KiwiSaver schemes to lose their QROPS status. As a result, individual members could not transfer their funds to another KiwiSaver scheme without incurring a UK tax charge; they were effectively “locked in” to a particular KiwiSaver provider. “Lock in” also causes residual issues for KiwiSaver providers who wish to merge under-performing or small schemes. 21 I propose that the KiwiSaver rules be changed to allow “locked-in” UK retirement savings to be transferred from KiwiSaver schemes into a New Zealand QROPS with the consent of the individual member. This would allow the remaining balance of the KiwiSaver account to be transferred to another KiwiSaver provider without incurring a UK tax charge. HMRC has confirmed that this solution would be effective. 22 The release of “locked-in” KiwiSavers is not expected to have any administrative impact. Application date 23 I recommend that the “scheme pays” proposal apply from 1 April 2026. This will allow sufficient time for both Inland Revenue and scheme providers to build the necessary systems. 24 I recommend that the “locked-in” KiwiSaver proposal apply from 1 April 2025. Cost of living implications 25 The proposals have no cost of living implications. Financial implications 26 Adoption of “scheme pays” will have a negative impact on tax revenue with a corresponding impact on the operating balance and net debt: $m increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 (1.600) 2028/29 2029/30 2030/31 2031/32 2032/33 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.900) (0.900) (1.000) (1.100) (1.100) 27 This should be charged against the tax policy scorecard. b01w5dhx65 2024-07-11 11:49:28 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28 The changes to release “locked-in” KiwiSavers are not expected to have revenue implications. Legislative implications 29 Implementing these proposals will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 30 If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these proposals in the next omnibus taxation Bill, scheduled for introduction in August 2024. 31 The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2024–25, Emergency Response, and Remedial Measures) Bill holds a category 5 priority on the 2024 Legislation Programme (to proceed to select committee by the end of 2024). Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 32 The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the UK Pension Transfers – Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes (QROPS) Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the quality assurance criteria. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 33 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to the proposals because the threshold for significance is not met. Population implications 34 The QROPS proposals will affect persons who have worked in the UK and contributed to a UK registered pension scheme. To ensure equity between persons in similar circumstances, “scheme pays” will be available to other persons who have foreign pension schemes (see paragraphs 57). Overall, the proposals are expected to be taxpayer-friendly. 35 A flat rate of 28% may affect persons who would be otherwise taxed at a lower rate on their annual income, whereas under the current rules the transferred sum can be taxed at rates up to 39% depending on its size. The overall impact may depend on individual circumstances. Human rights 36 The proposals have no implications for human rights. b01w5dhx65 2024-07-11 11:49:28 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 37 Targeted consultation has been undertaken with private sector fund providers and tax advisors, industry representatives and professional bodies in connection with the proposed changes to the pension transfer rules.

IR staff helping shape new department
=====================================

**19 July 2017**

Inland Revenue staff throughout New Zealand were told today how their submissions on proposals to re-shape the department have influenced the final outcome.  
  
Feedback from the consultation has driven a number of changes to what was originally proposed and those changes were presented at meetings around the country today, Inland Revenue Commissioner Naomi Ferguson said.  
  
Ms Ferguson said that as a result of comments from staff, additional specialist positions had been added to the new organisation.  
  
**No reduction in frontline services staff**  
  
“One thing from the original proposal that has not changed though – there will be no reduction in frontline customer services staff,” said the Commissioner.  
  
Ms Ferguson said the 3,300 customer-facing staff would all be offered new roles or confirmed straight into new roles.  
  
In addition there are around 900 positions on offer, with around the same number of positions affected – but the make-up of these positions is different with fewer available in management, but more available in specialist roles.  
  
“The main objective of our transformation is to organise in terms of customer-types rather than IR functions, so bringing our service people closer to customers in the way they do their work.  
  
**More specialist positions added**  
  
“A commonly raised concern was that the value and importance of technical specialists had not been sufficiently recognised in the proposal, so we’ve addressed that,” said the Commissioner.  
  
“We’ve added 18 specialist positions across the new organisation, and added more levels in some roles to reflect expertise,” she said.

**Timing**  
  
Timing to implement the new structure was also commented on widely in submissions.  
  
“Some thought we should give ourselves longer to implement the new structure and others did not want to delay,” said Ms Ferguson. “On balance we decided to push out the implementation date from the proposed 1 January next year to 12 February.  
  
“That gives everyone a bit more time to get through Christmas and New Year but keeps us on track to get all of this in place in time for the implementation of Stage 2 of our transformation in April.  
   
“And again, in response to concerns expressed, we’ve extended the period for people to make decisions about accepting the new roles from 10 working days to 15.”  
  
Ms Ferguson said that staff feedback on the proposals had played a very important part in shaping the new Inland Revenue organisation.  
  
**Pride and passion**  
  
“There’s a great deal of expertise, pride and passion amongst the people who work here at Inland Revenue and that has all been evident in the submissions we got,” she said.  
  
“Much of what was said was challenging and the important thing is that we’ve listened and the proposals have changed as a result. I’m grateful for the thought and effort that was put in by our people.”  
  
“As has been the case throughout this transformation process, clear and frequent communications will continue and we’ll keep offering support for staff no matter what their situation. And we’ll keep investing in skill development and training to help them be the best they can be in the new organisation.”

IR updates its compliance focus on Multinationals
=================================================

**08 November 2019**

Inland Revenue says new measures to ensure large multinationals pay the right tax in New Zealand are working well and should mean an extra $200m in tax collected each year.

The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018 made a series of changes to New Zealand's international tax rules as a response to the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Project Shifting (BEPS) project.

Inland Revenue’s International Revenue Strategy Manager John Nash says the Act included a wide range of measures to protect the New Zealand tax base from aggressive tax practices by multinationals.

“There’s a perception, since late 2012, that some multinationals pay little or no tax anywhere in the world by using international BEPS tax planning techniques,” John Nash says.

“Final tax returns for 2019 and 2020 haven’t been filed yet, so it’s early days, but we’re confident the new anti-BEPS measures are making a difference. We’re very pleased with the behavioural changes in various multinationals restructuring moves because they clearly recognise the effectiveness of the new rules.”

In the wake of the anti-BEPS measures coming into effect, IR has updated its compliance focus on multinationals.

Inland Revenue issued a comprehensive practical guide to all the new measures this week, [https://www.ird.govt.nz/international](https://www.ird.govt.nz/international)
as well as setting out its forward programme of work to ensure compliance by multinationals.

![John Nash launches the Multinational Enterprises Compliance Focus in Auckland](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2019/ir-updates-its-compliance-focus-on-multinationals/john-nash-launches-compliance-document-2.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221306&hash=2932AE5410452AE1AACEACF5CF8A9DE4)

“IR closely monitors all foreign-owned corporates with a turnover of more than $30m. They must submit information each year which must include their financial statements and tax reconciliations.

“We also have new intelligence from our tax treaty partners by way of country-by-country reports, telling us how major multinationals have allocated their profits around the world.

“If they don’t play by the new rules, we will know who they are, and they should expect we’ll be in touch. So, it makes sense for multinationals to look at restructuring their affairs, talk with us and get matters right up-front.”

John Nash says the anti-BEPS work must be a joint, world-wide effort.

“That’s why New Zealand has joined with more than 130 other jurisdictions in the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework, resulting in major legal and practical changes globally.

“We have a wide tax treaty network, including 40 double tax agreements with key trading partners, and a very close relationship with our major tax treaty partner, Australia. We routinely exchange intelligence on taxpayers and specific industries with the Australian Taxation Office.

“Across Asia, we have definitely noticed an increase in exchanges of information between tax authorities. These are a great help in the early identification of aggressive arrangements, which may adversely affect the New Zealand tax base,” John Nash says.

Child support is financial support paid by parents who either do not live with their children, or who share the care of their children with another person. Sometimes, children may be cared for by someone other than parents, such as grandparents, other family members, or Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children. In these cases, both parents may pay child support. Child support aims to ensure that: • • parents take financial responsibility for their children • • financial contributions from liable parents help to cover the cost of benefits that support their children. Paying child support We collect payments from the liable parent and pass them on to either: • • the receiving carer to help with the costs of looking after the child or • • the government, if the receiving carer is receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit or the receiving carer was receiving a sole parent rate benefit and the child support is for a period prior to 1 July 2023. When we pass payments on to a receiving carer, we tell Work and Income what has been paid so that it can be included as income for any benefits they receive. Inland Revenue does not deal directly with children or pay child support direct to the children. Payments are made to the receiving carer. Care arrangements Inland Revenue does not decide parenting arrangements, who is a parent or who has the day-to-day care of children. For help with these matters you can contact your lawyer, community law centre, local Family Court coordinator or Citizens Advice Bureau. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 9 Child support options There are three options for setting up child support: • • private arrangement • • voluntary agreement, or • • formula assessment. If a carer receives an Unsupported Child’s Benefit they’ll complete a child support formula assessment application as part of the benefit application process. Carers who do not receive an Unsupported Child’s Benefit can make their own arrangements for child support. Private arrangement A private arrangement suits parents and carers who can come to an agreement on the amount of child support and do not need our help to manage the payments. A private arrangement gives you the flexibility to agree: • • the amount of child support to pay • • when it will be paid, and • • how it will be paid. Voluntary agreement A voluntary agreement suits parents and carers who can agree on an amount of child support, but still want us to be involved to collect the child support and pass it on. A voluntary agreement lets you and the other parent or carer set the amount of child support paid, then we apply the rules for when a payment is due and when it is paid to the carer. See page 26 for more information on voluntary agreements. Formula assessment A formula assessment suits parents and carers who are unable to agree on an amount to pay or prefer that we work out the amount that should be paid. Because we use a set formula it is less flexible than other types of child support arrangements but provides an impartial calculation that considers the ability of both parents to contribute to the financial support of their children. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 10 Either parent can apply for a formula assessment of child support. Non-parent carers who care for a child for at least 35% of the time can also apply for a formula assessment of child support. A non-parent carer must apply from both parents of a child. A formula assessment must be used if a carer is receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit. Which children qualify for child support? Children who are not living with one or both of their parents either some or all the time, qualify for child support. They must be a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand. Child support for a child stops once they turn 18 unless they are attending school. If they attend school for the full school year in which they turn 18, then child support stops on the 31st of December of that year. A child is no longer eligible for child support if they: • • are 16 or older and working full time or receiving a benefit or student allowance • • marry or enter a civil union or de facto relationship • • are aged 18 and no longer attending a registered school. “Full-time” means working as an employee or being self- employed for a minimum (on average) of 30 hours a week or in employment that is considered full-time regardless of actual hours worked. Working for Families Child support is different from Working for Families. Working for Families are a government-funded payment for families with children who meet certain qualifying criteria. For more information, read our guide Working and raising a family - IR201 or What are Working for Families Tax Credits? at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Help from Work and Income You and your family may be able to get support from Work and Income. Go to www.workandincome.govt.nz for information on what assistance is available to you. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 11 Other government help If you want to learn more about other government services or support that may be available to you go to www.govt.nz How we work out child support When a person applies for a child support formula assessment, we use the formula set out in the Child Support Act 1991 to work out how much child support is payable. The formula considers some basic principles: • • support for a child should be assessed using both parent’s income • • it should take into account the age of the child and the amount of care each parent has • • it should take into account support they provide for other children, and • • the costs of raising the child should be shared between the parents based on their financial ability. The parent who earns the most income will usually be expected to contribute to more of the costs of raising a child. Income of each parent We work out the income to use for a parent by looking at the type of income they earned in the previous tax year. If we are working out child support for the year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, we look at what is earned for 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The income used is called the adjusted income. If all of your income is taxed at source, such as salary, wages, a benefit or interest and dividends your adjusted income, is income you earned in the last calendar year (1 January to 31 December). If we are working out your child support for the year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 this would be based on your taxable income earned in the year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 12 Your adjusted income is your income from two tax years ago if you need to: • • provide an income tax return – for example, your income is from rents or self-employment • • tell us about other income – for example, overseas income. If we are working out your child support for the year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 this would be based on your income tax return for the year 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. Income from two years ago is adjusted for inflation. If you have losses from a previous tax year in your income, we will ignore those losses for child support. This means the losses will not reduce your income for child support purposes. Allowances When working out child support we use allowances to recognise other costs that a parent has to support themselves or their children. These are: • • Living allowance – a set amount deducted from a parent’s income for their own living costs to recognise they need to support themselves. • • Dependent child allowance – an amount deducted from a parent’s income to recognise the costs of their dependent children. These are children child support is not paid for. • • Multi-group allowance – an amount deducted from a parent’s income to recognise the costs of other children they pay or receive child support for, to a different parent. The child support formula steps There are eight steps in the child support formula. Step 1 Work out each parent’s adjusted income. Step 2 Reduce the adjusted income by any of the following allowances if they apply: • • Living allowance • • Dependent child allowance • • Multi-group allowance The result is the parent’s child support income. Step 3 Add both parents’ child support income together to get a combined child support income. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 13 Step 4 Divide each parent’s child support income by the combined child support income to get an income percentage for each parent. Step 5 Work out each parent’s amount of recognised care for the child, and work out the care cost percentage (that is the percentage of costs the parent needs to be able to cover based on the time the child lives with them). Step 6 Subtract the care cost percentage from the income percentage for each parent. The result is the “child support percentage”. • • If the result is a negative percentage, that parent is a receiving carer. • • If the result is a positive percentage, that parent is a liable parent. • • If the result is a nil percentage, the parent is a liable parent. Step 7 Work out the costs for each child, based on the parents’ combined child support income and applying this against the “Child expenditure” table. The table can be found at ird.govt.nz/child-support/types/formula-assessment/amount expenditure-tables Step 8 Work out the child support payable by multiplying the positive child support percentage (from step 6) by the cost of the child (from step 7). You can work through the child support formula for your situation using the child support liability/entitlement calculator at ird.govt.nz/child-support/types/formula-assessment/ amount/estimate Recognised care The child support formula assessment recognises the care a parent provides for their child if they provide ongoing daily care for at least 28% of the time - approximately two nights a week on average (103 nights a year). We generally determine care based on the number of nights a person cares for a child but can look at day-time care if nights in care is not appropriate. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 14 How recognised care affects a formula assessment Care is recognised in the child support formula assessment as a contribution towards the costs of raising a child and helps determine what a parent pays or receives: • • care between 25% and 35% of the time can reduce the amount of child support a parent pays • • a parent can receive child support if they have care of a child for at least 35% of the time • • a parent will not pay child support if they have care of a child more than 65% of the time. For more information about recognised care and how it might apply to you, read our guide Helping you to understand recognised care - IR156 ird.govt.nz/childsupport 15 Applying for child support A parent or non-parent carer can apply for a formula assessment of child support. You can apply online through your myIR account. If you’re getting Unsupported Child’s Benefit If you’re an Unsupported Child’s Benefit, you must apply for child support. Your Work and Income case manager will discuss this with you when you apply for a benefit. If you’re a non-parent carer If you’re a non-parent carer, you can apply by completing the Application to assess child support by a non-parent carer - IR954 form. Non-parent carers: • • must have a minimum of 35% care of a child to apply for child support (at least 128 nights over a 12-month period) • • cannot be living in a relationship with a parent of the child • • must apply for child support from both parents. If you are not able to provide information about both parents; where possible, we’ll identify the other parent from the information we hold and include their details in the assessment. We will not assess the other parent if they are deceased, unknown, or not a New Zealand citizen or ordinarily resident in New Zealand or Australia. If you’re not receiving an Unsupported Child’s Benefit you can choose not to receive child support from one of the liable parents. This is called a payment waiver. For more information go to our website at ird.govt.nz/childsupport or read our factsheet Child support - non-parent carers - IR1023 Note If you’re receiving board and lodging payments from Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children for the child in your care, you cannot receive child support for them. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 16 What you need for your application For us to accept a child support application the child must have an IRD number. If your child doesn’t have one you can apply by completing an IRD number application - resident individual - IR595 form. You also need to provide proof of parentage for the child, this is usually a New Zealand birth certificate but can also be one of the following documents: • • the child’s full overseas birth certificate (with a certified English translation if necessary) • • adoption order for the child • • a paternity order for the child made by a New Zealand or overseas court • • a document signed by the parent acknowledging they are the child’s parent • • a copy of the Family Court’s declaration of step-parentage. If you do not have proof of paternity A parent will not be made liable to pay child support until we receive proof of parentage. If you do not have any proof of paternity when you decide to apply for child support, you can still apply and tell us the name of the person you believe is the parent of the child. If a paternity order is made later, we can start your child support from the day you made your original application if: • • you apply to the court for the paternity order before or within 60-days of applying for child support, and • • you provide the paternity order to Inland Revenue within 60-days of it being granted. If you do not meet these timeframes, we’ll start the child support from the date we get the paternity order. To learn more about applying for paternity orders go to justice.govt.nz/family/care-of-children/prove-paternity ird.govt.nz/childsupport 17 What happens if you do not accept my application? If we do not accept your application, we’ll send you a letter telling you why. If you disagree with our decision, you have 28 days to object. If we do not accept your application because of some missing information, you need to send us that information as soon as possible. We’ll start your child support from the date we receive it. Example You apply for child support on 1 February but you do not include the child’s birth certificate. We decline your application. You then send us the birth certificate and we receive it on 1 April. Your child support will start from 1 April. What is the minimum child support? There is a minimum amount of child support that a liable parent must pay for a year. The minimum is: • • required to be paid by the liable parent even if the formula works out less than that amount • • applied to the liable parent for all the children they pay for. So, if they pay child support for more than one child, the minimum payment is divided between all the children. • • adjusted each year in line with inflation. For the current year’s minimum amount, go to ird.govt.nz/child-support/types/formula-assessment/ amount/annual-rates To work out how much your child support might be, use our child support liability/entitlement calculator at ird.govt.nz/ child-support/types/formula-assessment/amount/estimate HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 18 After we accept your application Confirming the amount of child support If you apply for a formula assessment of child support we use the formula in the Child Support Act 1991 to work out how much child support needs to be paid and send you a letter to let you know the details of your child support. The receiving carer will get a letter advising their child support entitlement and the liable parent will get a letter advising them how much child support they need to pay. The letter also confirms: • • who you’re receiving child support from, or who you’re paying child support to, • • the children the child support is for, and how much child support you’ll receive or pay, and • • the other information we’ve used to work out your child support for example, your income, or other dependent children. If you have registered a voluntary agreement, we will send the liable parent and the receiving carer a letter confirming how much child support is to be paid each month. Checking the details of your child support You need to check the details in your letter to make sure that we have included all your relevant circumstances, for example, we have included all your dependent children. If something is missing, you need to tell us within 28 days of the date we sent you the letter so we can update your information from the start of your child support. Example We sent you a letter on 28th of July letting you know you have been assessed to pay child support from the 21st of July. You notice that we have not included Jeremy, your child with your new partner as a dependent. You need to contact us with the details about Jeremy by the 25th of August so we can update your child support from the 21st of July. If you tell us after the 25th of August, we will update your child support from the date you contact us. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 19 Making child support payments Deductions from employment income If a liable parent has employment income (salary, wages, or ACC) or receives a benefit, they must pay their child support by deductions from this income. We will work out how much needs to be deducted and let the liable parent’s employer or Work and Income know how much to deduct and when to start the deductions. There may be times when a liable parent does not want deductions from their employer, for example they have a genuine privacy concern, or they will only be employed casually. In these types of situations, we can allow the liable parent to pay another way as long as they keep up to date with their payments. If for any reason an employer does not make a child support deduction as expected, for example the liable parent has taken leave without pay, the liable parent will need to make those missed payments themselves. How to make payments There are several options for liable parents who need organise their payments themselves. Go to our website at ird.govt.nz/cs-pay to view the information about how to make payments. When payments are due Liable parents have 30 days from the date we send the first child support to pay letter to make the first child support payment. The first payment will normally be a part-month payment, because we calculate the amount payable from the date we accept the application. Receiving carers should receive their first payment about seven weeks after we receive the application, as long as the liable parent makes their first payment on time. After that, child support for a month needs to be paid by the 20th of the following month. For example, payment for August is due on the 20th of September. After that, child support is then paid to the receiving carers by the 23rd of the month. For example, child support for August HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 20 has to be paid on the 20th of September and we pay this to the receiving carer by the 23rd of September. What happens if child support is paid late? If you are new to paying child support, we do not charge any penalties in the first 60 days. This gives you a chance to make sure you understand your obligations and have your payments organised. After this one-off grace period, if you do not pay your child support by the due date, a two stage late payment penalty is charged as follows: • • 2% of the unpaid child support the day after the due date • • 8% of the unpaid child support 27 days later. Example You did not pay your monthly assessment of $300 for May. We charged a $6 penalty (2% of the amount due) on 21 June. You now owe $306. If you still do not make a payment before 17 July, a $24 penalty (8% of the $300 child support amount due) is charged. You now owe $330. What happens if I get behind on payments? If you get behind on your child support payments, it’s important that you catch up as quickly as possible. The best way to do this is by paying the total amount in one lump sum. If you cannot pay the amount owing in one lump sum contact us on 0800 221 221 or go to ird.govt.nz/child-support/ managing/debt/liable-parents to find out your options. If you do not contact us to arrange to repay the amount owing, we’ll need to take collection action. If you have an employer or are on ACC or a benefit, we’ll arrange for extra child support to be taken direct from your income each payday (we can ask for up to 40% of your income after tax). We may also collect overdue child support from: • • bank accounts (the available balance on the account) • • any other money that may be payable to you, for example, a trust account or superannuation payouts. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 21 We can also take legal action against you such as stopping you at the border or charging orders over assets. However, we’ll always try to work out a payment agreement with you before taking any legal action. If you have a tax refund owing, we’ll use this to pay your child support debt, even if you have a payment agreement with us. Remember we cannot pass on any payments for the support of your children until you have paid us. Receiving child support payments What happens to the child support payments? We pass child support payments that we have received from the liable parent to the receiving carer. However, if the receiving carer receives an Unsupported Child’s Benefit, the child support is passed on to the government to help pay for their benefit. When and how do I get paid? When you apply for child support, we’ll ask you for your bank account details. We’ll pay your child support into your bank account by the 23rd of each month as long as the liable parent has paid. When we pass payments on to you, we tell Work and Income what has been paid so that it can be included as income for any benefit you receive. Example If you’re entitled to receive child support of $900 each month from the liable parent for a child and you receive an Unsupported Child’s Benefit of $700 each month for that child, we’ll pay you child support of $200. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 22 How can I check my payments? You can check what you’ve received, and what you’re entitled to receive, by: • • logging into your myIR account • • using our 0800 self-service number. See page 30 for more about this service. What if the liable parent does not pay? We can only pay a receiving carer the child support that is paid by the liable parent. If they do not pay, we’ll try to recover the unpaid child support. Changes to your circumstances Please let us know immediately about any changes to your circumstances that could affect your child support. You need to tell us about your changes in circumstances within 28 days of the change happening. If there is a delay in telling us this could lead to you paying or receiving the wrong amount of child support. See the checklist on the next page for changes you need to tell us about. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 23 ✓ Checklist You start living with the person who you pay child support to, or who pays you child support. You are a receiving carer for child support and start living in Australia. You start or stop being liable for child support in Australia. The children you pay or receive child support for stop living in New Zealand. Any child leaves your care or comes into your care (this may be a child you’re paying child support for). Any child in your care starts work, or goes on to a benefit or student allowance. Your 18-year old child stops attending school. Any child in your care marries, enters into a civil union or de facto relationship. The amount of time a child is in your care changes. If you are unsure whether you need to tell us about a change call us on 0800 221 221 to discuss your situation. You can tell us about a change using your myIR account or by completing the Change of circumstances - IR116 form. You can download a copy from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides and send it to us. Changes to the amount of child support you pay or receive If we send you a letter to say the amount of child support has changed, it could be for one of the following reasons: • • a child has started or stopped living with either parent • • either parent’s income has changed • • either parent has started or stopped paying for another child • • the liable parent has been exempted from paying child support. For more information please see page 27. When we can, we will tell you the reason your child support has changed. However, please note that due to privacy for other parties in your child support assessment we’re not always allowed to tell you exactly why the amount has changed. HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 24 What if I receive too much child support? If your circumstances change in any way, you can receive too much child support. It’s important you tell us as soon as possible to avoid an overpayment. Overpaid child support normally needs to be repaid to us. We recognise that this could cause difficulties and we’re open to discussing a payment agreement with you. If you’re still entitled to receive child support, we’ll usually arrange with you to reduce those payments by an agreed amount until we recover the debt. In some circumstances, we may write the debt off. Please call us on 0800 221 221 to discuss your situation. Time limit on reassessments for past child support There is a four-year time limit on assessing past child support years. This means we cannot change your child support for a year that ended more than four-years ago unless one of the limited exceptions apply, for example information supplied was fraudulent or misleading. When does child support stop? Your child support will stop when the child: • • turns 18 years of age, or if they are 18 years of age and attending school at the 31st of December, or • • starts working full-time (on average 30 hours a week or more), or • • receives a benefit or student allowance, or • • starts living in a marriage, civil union or defacto relationship. Can I cancel child support? If you are the receiving carer and you want to cancel child support, you can do this in your myIR account by calling us or by completing a Cancelling your child support - IR107 form. You can download a copy from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides If you want to cancel a child support formula assessment anyone with at least 28% care of the child must also agree to cancel the child support. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 25 You cannot cancel child support for any child you receive Unsupported Child’s Benefit for. Does living in Australia affect my child support? There is an agreement with Australia covering how child support is administered when one parent lives in Australia and one lives in New Zealand. This agreement means: • • receiving carers living in Australia must apply in Australia to receive child support and we will collect payments from the parent living in New Zealand if Australia requests it • • receiving carers living in New Zealand must apply through us to receive child support and Australia will collect payments from the liable parent in Australia if we request it. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/child-support/overseas/australia What if my income is lower than what’s used in my child support? If you believe your income will be lower than the amount used in your child support assessment you may be able to estimate your income. Your income needs to have reduced by 15% or more from the income we used in your child support assessment. If you estimate your income, at the end of the child support year, we will compare your estimated income to your actual income and reassess your child support to make sure you paid or received the right amount. To learn more about estimating your income go to ird.govt.nz/child-support/managing/income HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 26 Voluntary agreements We encourage parents and carers to negotiate their own child support agreements, if possible. If parents and carers can agree on child support, but would like us to administer it for them, they can register a voluntary agreement with us. How to register an agreement You can register a voluntary agreement using your myIR account or by completing a Registration of voluntary agreement for Child Support - IR102 form. Both parties must agree for us to register the agreement. Your voluntary agreement for child support must be: • • for at least $10 a week ($520 a year) The parties to the agreement must both be either New Zealand citizens or ordinarily resident in New Zealand, and the children must qualify for child support. Note If a receiving carer is getting an unsupported child’s benefit they can only register a voluntary agreement if the amount is equal to or more than the amount payable under a child support formula assessment. What happens next? After we register your agreement, we’ll work out the monthly payments and let you know how much you’ll pay or receive. Note When we’ve registered your voluntary agreement, only Inland Revenue can collect the payments. Changing or ending the agreement You can change your agreement at any time in your myIR account or by completing a new Registration of voluntary agreement for Child Support - IR102 form and sending it to us. The receiving carer can end the voluntary agreement by completing the Cancellation of child support - IR107 form or in their myIR account. ird.govt.nz/childsupport 27 If either party decides to apply for child support under a formula assessment this ends the voluntary agreement. Are there exemptions from paying child support? Temporary exemptions You may be able to apply for a temporary exemption from making child support payments if you’re: • • in prison for 13 weeks or longer • • in hospital for 13 weeks or more • • suffering a long term-illness • • under 16 years of age. If you’re in prison you must apply for the exemption before you’re released. If you’re in hospital you have up to three months after the day you leave hospital to apply for the exemption. If you are suffering a long-term illness you have up to three months after your illness ends to apply for the exemption. You have up to three months after the day you turn 16 to apply for the exemption. There may be reasons why you do not qualify for an exemption, for example, you have income over a certain level. To learn more about temporary exemptions go to ird.govt.nz/ child-support/reviews-objections-exemptions/exemptions What if I disagree with a temporary exemption? If the liable parent has been granted an exemption from paying child support, you may be able to have it reviewed. For more information about exemption reviews please read our guide Helping you to understand child support reviews - IR175 Permanent exemptions Victims of a sex offence can apply for a permanent exemption from paying child support for a child if: • • you believe the child was conceived as the result of a sex offence (as defined by sections 127-144C of the Crimes Act 1961). HELPING YOU TO UNDERSTAND CHILD SUPPORT 28 A permanent exemption will be granted if: • • a person other than you has been: – convicted of the sex offence, or – proved to have committed the sex offence before the Youth Court, or – If no-one has been convicted of the offence, Inland Revenue is satisfied it is likely that an offence has been committed • • in the opinion of Inland Revenue, the child was conceived as a result of that sex offence. If no one has been convicted of the sex offence you will need to provide as much information as you can to support your application for the exemption, such as a letter from a doctor or a police report. Call us on 0800 221 221 if you would like more information.

We’ll review our decision or your assessment, and the reasons you’ve given in your objection and advise you of the outcome. If you’re a liable parent you have to continue paying your child support while we consider your objection and until we advise you to pay a different amount. What if the amount of child support I’m paying or receiving does not consider my circumstances? If you disagree with the amount of child support you’re paying or receiving because of special circumstances, you can apply for a child support administrative review. An administrative review is a way of looking at your child support formula assessment to see if it can be altered to fit your particular situation. The administrative review is done by a review officer who is an independent person contracted by us. Review officers are experienced in law and follow precedents set by past court cases.

If your annual family income has dropped, you may be entitled to more money, though this will depend on your particular situation. To update your records, go to your Working for Families account in myIR and select ‘Family and income details’. If you’re entitled to more money, we’ll increase your payments and let you know in myIR. Student loans If you’re an employee experiencing hardship, you can apply for lower repayments.

Go to your child support account in myIR and select ‘Child support change of circumstances’. Tailored tax options If your income drops, you can apply for a tailored tax code, tailored tax rate, or a certificate of exemption. Using 1 of these options may help you pay the right amount of tax every payday, rather than possibly having a big tax bill or big refund at the end of the year. ird.govt.nz/tailored-tax-code Estimate or re-estimate your provisional tax A drop in income may mean you can pay less provisional tax. To re-estimate your provisional tax, go to ird.govt.nz/prov-tax-estimate Tax relief options If you have overdue tax, and immediate full payment will cause you serious hardship, you can set up an instalment arrangement to repay the money in manageable amounts over time. Log in to your myIR account, select ‘I want to ...’ then ‘Request an instalment arrangement’. We’ll stop charging late payment penalties if you keep to the arrangement. In some cases, we may be able to write off some of your debt. You can apply for tax relief in myIR.

How redundancy payments and retirement allowances are taxed Redundancy payments and retirement allowances are taxable income. When your employer pays you, they’ll deduct tax and you’ll get the after-tax amount in your hand. How much tax? Your employer will estimate your income for the year including your redundancy payment or retirement allowance. They will then deduct tax from the payment or allowance at your top tax rate. Once we know your actual income for the year, we’ll work out if you have any end-of-year tax to pay, or if you’ll get a refund. You do not pay ACC earners’ levy on redundancy payments or retirement allowances. KiwiSaver: retirement allowances Your employer will deduct your KiwiSaver contributions from any retirement allowance you receive. Your employer will also make employer contributions (if you’re eligible). KiwiSaver: redundancy payments Your employer won’t deduct KiwiSaver contributions from redundancy payments or make any employer contributions. Student loans If you have a student loan, your employer will deduct student loan repayments from any redundancy payment or retirement allowance you receive. Child support (paying parents) If you pay child support, your employer will deduct child support from any redundancy payment or retirement allowance you receive. Your redundancy payment or retirement allowance won’t change the amount of child support you need to pay. That’s because we base your child support on your previous year’s income. But we will include your redundancy payment or retirement allowance as income in your next year’s child support assessment. However, if your income in the next year drops by 15% or more, you can ask us to reduce your child support payments. Go to your child support account in myIR and select ‘Child support change of circumstances’. If you have overdue child support, you may like to consider using part of your redundancy payment or retirement allowance to repay the amount owing. Working for Families Is your Working for Families entitlement paid weekly or fortnightly? If you get a redundancy payment or retirement allowance, your Working for Families payments will likely change. They could drop ─ or even stop ─ for the rest of the tax year (1 April to 31 March). That’s because your entitlement amount is based on your estimated annual family income. Once we know your actual family income for the year, we’ll work out if we overpaid or underpaid you. Are you on the right tax code (employees)? Have you started another job since you got your redundancy payment or retirement allowance? Please make sure you’re on the right tax code. If you’re unsure, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-codes- individuals You’ll find an online tool to help you work out what tax code to use. The right tax code helps ensure you pay the right tax during the year and avoid a big tax bill at the end of the year. Is a tailored tax option right for you? A redundancy payment or retirement allowance may push you into a higher-than-normal tax bracket for that year. In that case, a ‘standard’ tax code may not have deducted enough tax from your salary or wage earlier in the year. Did you know you can apply for a tailored tax code? Using this code means you’ll have extra tax taken from your salary or wage for the rest of the current tax year. The tailored tax code takes into account your redundancy payment or retirement allowance and may prevent a surprise bill at the end of the year.

Business Ngā Ūmanga While the information in this factsheet is for anyone who has lost their job, there's an additional section for contractors only - see the next column. Assistance for contractors and employees Whether you're a contractor or an employee, you may qualify for an increase in Working for Families Tax Credits, or a reduction in your child support payments. Please contact us as soon as your circumstances changes so we can ensure you receive your full entitlements. Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) WfFTC is paid to families with dependent children aged 18 or under. If you currently receive WfFTC, you may be entitled to an increased payment. You can either update your family income through your myIR secure online services account at www.ird.govt.nz or call us on 0800 227 773 and we'll take your details over the phone. If you don't get WfFTC because you were earning too much, but your income has reduced, it's worth checking to see if you now qualify. Use the "Estimate your Working for Families Tax Credits" calculator at www.ird.govt.nz "Work it out". Make sure you select the calculator for the correct year. You can apply for WfFTC at www.ird.govt.nz "Get it done online". Child support A reduction in income won't automatically change your current child support assessment calculation. If you expect your income, which we based your currect assessment on, to decrease by 15% or more, you may be able to estimate your income or ask for an administrative review. You can update your income details by logging into your myIR account and selecting "income" under the "My family" tab. You'll need to estimate how much you expect to earn for the whole year and provide evidence to support your estimation, eg, payslips or, if you're self- employed, a letter from your accountant. Alternatively, you can fill out an Estimate of income for child support assessment (IR104) form and mail it in to us. Any change in your circumstances may affect the child support payments you receive or make. If there's been a change, please let us know immediately by calling 0800 221 221. Additional assistance for contractors We understand losing a contract unexpectedly can have a big impact on your cashflows. You may be tempted to put your taxes "on hold" for the time being. But the sooner you contact us, the sooner we can take some of the pressure off. We'd like to tell you about the ways we can help. We recommend you discuss your options with your tax advisor before making any decisions. Returns and payments You should continue to pay your taxes by the due date. Late payment penalties and interest apply to late payments. If you're unable to make a payment, call us on 0800 377 771. Together, we'll work out a solution, taking into account your individual circumstances. For example, you may qualify for an instalment arrangement, which allows you to pay the tax over a period of time. If you contact us before the due date, and the arrangement is approved, you'll only pay a late payment penalty of 1%. No further penalties will be charged, provided you keep to the terms of the arrangement. Note that interest charges will still apply. Affected by a receivership? This factsheet is for contractors and employees who were previously working for an organisation now in receivership. If your income for the year will be lower than expected, we can help you manage your tax payments, and claim any financial assistance available to you through the tax system.

Individuals Ngā Hunga Takitahi IR1021 | March 2024 Do you rent your holiday home to the public for short-term stays? You need to be aware of the tax rules that apply to “mixed-use” assets. Our factsheet tells you what you need to know. You don’t need to read this factsheet if your property is: • a residential property used for long-term rental • a home office, and your expense claim is based on floor area • your home and you rent a room out for short-term stays. The mixed-use asset rules don’t apply in these situations. The mixed-use asset rules apply differently depending on whether the asset is owned by a natural person or a close company. This overview is for when a mixed-use holiday home is owned by a natural person(s). You have a mixed-use holiday home if, during the income year, it is used both for “private use” and “income-earning use”, and it’s also unused for 62 days or more. You have to determine if your holiday home is a mixed-use asset each income year. This can change from year to year. If the mixed-use asset rules apply, they set out what income from the mixed-use holiday home is taxable, and what proportion of expenses you can deduct. Your income and deductions depend on the level of private use and income- earning use of your mixed-use holiday home. What is “private use”? Private use of your holiday home means use by: • you or your family, even if rent is paid. • non-associated people if you earn rent at less than 80% of market rates. To help you work out if someone is associated to you use our guide Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes – IR620. What is “income-earning use”? Income-earning use of your holiday home means use by a non-associated person from which you earn rent at 80% or more of market rates. It also includes time you stay in your property to repair damage caused by paying guests. Opting out If you meet certain criteria for the income year, you may choose to opt out of the mixed-use asset rules. If you opt out, the rental activity doesn’t need to be included in your income tax return. You don’t return any of your income and you can’t claim any of your expenses for the holiday home. Tax rules for holiday homes You can opt out if: • your gross income for the year from the income-earning use of your mixed-use holiday home is under $4,000, or • your holiday home is loss-making, and your gross income from income-earning use of the holiday home is less than 2% of the value of the holiday home. To calculate the value, use the most recent of: • the local authority capital or annual (rateable) value • the purchase price (or market value at purchase if you bought the property from an associated person). What income is taxable? You must pay income tax on rent earned from income-earning use. Any rent from private use is exempt from income tax. What expenses are deductible? Expenses from mixed-use holiday homes fall into three categories: 1. Fully deductible. You can claim 100% of any expense which relates solely to the income-earning use of the holiday home. Examples: Costs of advertising for guests, any additional insurance or rates you have to pay (over what you otherwise would) because you rent the holiday home out. 2. Not deductible. You can’t claim any expenses relating to the private use of the holiday home. Example: Costs of a boat and quad bike stored in a locked garage and unavailable to the people renting your holiday home. 3. Apportioned. If an expense relates to both income- earning use and private use, you need to apportion it using this formula: Expense× income-earning days income-earning days + private-use days Examples: rates, insurance, internet and power bills, repairs for general wear and tear. Only include interest that is deductible as an expense in this formula. Note From 1 October 2021, the interest limitation rules have limited the ability to claim interest as a deduction for your holiday home in New Zealand, unless an exclusion or exemption applies. For more information, see our guide Rental Income - IR264. ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Carry forward of excess deductions If your deductible expenditure under the mixed-use asset rules for your holiday home is more than the income, you may not be able to claim the whole deduction in that year. This will be the case if your income from income-earning use of the holiday home is less than 2% of the holiday home’s value. In that situation, you can only claim a deduction equal to the amount of the income from income- earning use of the property. You’ll have to carry forward the excess deductions to a future income year when you earn income from the holiday home. You can use the carried forward excess deductions in a future year if the income from income-earning use of the holiday home in that year is more than that year’s deductions under the mixed-use asset rules. The maximum amount you can claim from the excess is the difference between that year’s income from income- earning use of the holiday home and that year’s allowable deductions under the mixed-use asset rules for the holiday home. Any remaining excess continues to be carried forward to future years. Record keeping Please keep records so you can work out your income tax obligations at the end of the tax year. Your records should show: private-use days, income-earning days, the expenses you paid, and the name of each guest together with their relationship to you and the rent they paid. More information This factsheet has given you a brief overview of the tax rules affecting mixed-use holiday homes owned by a natural person. For more information including how the rules apply to close companies go to taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz and read our: • Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 25, No 9 (October 2013) • Question we’ve been asked (QB) 19/06 • Question we’ve been asked (QB) 19/07 Example of calculations required for a mixed-use holiday home The facts Peter owns a holiday home in Waihi. During the 2021– 22 income year, the home was used by Peter and his family (42 days) and non-associated paying guests (80 days). For the rest of the year (243 days), the home was unused. Peter’s sister paid rent of $3,150. Rental income from non-associated paying guests came to $12,000. Expenses were: Advertising for guests $500 General repairs and maintenance $750 Repairing window (broken by non-associated paying guests) $150 Cleaning septic tank $400 Insurance (home and contents) $800 Lawn-mowing contractor $250 Fishing licences (for the family) $250 Rates $1,500 Deductible interest\* $800 Total expenses for the year $5,400 \* interest of $800 is the portion that is deductible during the phase-out period for the interest limitation rules The calculations Peter’s property is a mixed-use holiday home because it was used for private use and income-earning use and it was unoccupied for 62 days or more. His gross rental income is $12,000. The $3,150 received from his sister is exempt from income tax because she is a member of Peter’s family. Expenses for the home fall into all three categories. Fully deductible (expenses relate to income-earning use): Advertising for guests $500 Repairing window (broken by non-associated paying guests) $150 $650 Not deductible (expenses relate to private use): Fishing licences (for the family) $250 Apportioned (expenses relate to both income-earning and private use): General repairs and maintenance $750 Cleaning septic tank $400 Insurance (home and contents) $800 Lawn-mowing contractor $250 Rates $1,500 Deductible interest $800 $4,500 Peter applies the apportionment formula to the apportioned expenses: Expense× income-earning days income-earning days + private-use days =$4,500× 80 80 + 42 =$2,950.82 This means Peter’s expense claim totals $3,600.82 (the fully deductible expenses of $650.00 plus the apportioned expenses of $2,950.82). His taxable income from his property is: Gross income $ 12,000.00 Less expenses $ 3,600.82 Taxable income $ 8,399.18
ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Business Ngā Ūmanga IR 1022 | April 2023 When you’re selling goods or services over the internet, you have the same tax obligations as any other business. This factsheet explains your obligations for income tax and GST, and what to do if you need to correct your tax returns. Trading online is the same as doing business from a shop, or from your home. Any income you earn from a business (including online auctions or sales sites such as TradeMe) needs to be included in an income tax return. You work out how much tax you’ll need to pay each year in your income tax return. If you’re trading online and answer yes to some or all of the following questions, it’s likely you’ll need to declare the income you’ve earned. • Did you buy goods with the intention of reselling them? • Did you intend to make a profit from the sale? • Are you providing services in return for payment? (The payment does not have to be cash.) • Do you regularly sell goods or services online? • Do you sell online as part of an already established business? Note: There is no minimum income level to be in business. Telling us about your online business We routinely monitor online transactions. If you’ve been trading online for some time and think you’ve overlooked your tax obligations, talk to a tax advisor or contact us. The easiest way to keep on top of your tax affairs is to tell us when you start trading. This way we can help you register for myIR, and send you the forms and information you’ll need at the right time. Filing an income tax return Generally a business income year is from 1 April to 31 March. At the end of the year you need to work out your taxable income. You may need a tax advisor or accountant to do this for you. You also need to decide what business type your online activity will be as this will affect how it’s registered for income tax purposes with us. This will also determine how you return your taxable income details to us at the end of a tax year. Online trading tax implications The business types and returns: • Sole trader – you use your own personal IRD number and file an IR3 return • Partnership or look-through company – needs its own IRD number and files an IR7 return • Company – needs its own IRD number and files an IR4 return • Trust or estate – needs its own IRD number and files an IR6 return. For more about filing returns go to ird.govt.nz/income- tax Registering for GST If you’re providing goods or services and your turnover is more than $60,000 in any 12-month period, or is likely to be more than $60,000 in the next 12 months, you’ll need to register for GST. If you need help deciding, use our guided help - Do I need to register for GST? Expenses from internet trading When you’re in business, you can claim certain expenses. These can include stationery and supplies for the business. Some expenses are specific to trading over the internet. This table is a summary of the different website expenses and the income tax treatment for them. Cost Deductible as an expense Depreciable as a capital expense Purchase or registration of a domain name NoNo Annual fee for domain registration YesNo Renting space on an ISP server YesNo Site design costsNoYes Site update costs YesNo ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Reconstruction, upgrading or functional improvement to website NoYes Cost of a server (computer) NoYes When an expense is deductible, the entire expense is included in your income tax return. When an expense is depreciable, you can only claim a percentage of the expense each year. Each type of depreciable expense has a different percentage, which you can look up in our Depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Exports and GST If you’re GST registered and exporting goods or services, these sales are zero-rated, so you charge 0% GST. When you’re selling exports over the internet, you need to be able to prove the products are leaving New Zealand, or the service has been provided outside New Zealand. Digital products such as music, software or e-books sold to overseas customers (and downloaded overseas) are considered services, so you need to be able to show the buyer downloaded them overseas. Secondhand goods and GST When buying secondhand goods in New Zealand from someone who is not registered for GST, the purchase price is considered GST-inclusive, and you can claim the GST back in your GST return. You still need to keep all the taxable supply information usually provided in an invoice or other documents. When you buy secondhand goods from an unregistered person, and then sell those goods over the internet, the ordinary rules apply. This means if the goods are sold to: • a New Zealand customer, the sale includes GST at the normal rate • an overseas customer, and you ship the goods to them, the sale includes GST at 0% (zero-rated) • an overseas customer, and the export is handled by a third-party supplier, the sale cannot be zero-rated, and includes GST at the normal rate. You can find more information about e-commerce and GST on our website at ird.govt.nz/special-supplies or in our guide GST plus - IR546 for a more detailed explanation of zero-rated and special supplies. Voluntary disclosures If you realise you’ve made a mistake in your return, you can make a voluntary disclosure to tell us what’s wrong with your taxes. If you make a voluntary disclosure before you’re notified of a tax audit or investigation, we’ll reduce the shortfall penalties charged and we will not prosecute you. Read more about voluntary disclosures in our guide Putting your tax returns right – IR280 Tax residency and double tax agreements When you’re a New Zealand tax resident, you need to pay tax in New Zealand on both your New Zealand and overseas income. You’re a New Zealand tax resident if any of the following situations apply: • You’re in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period • You have an enduring relationship with New Zealand • You’re away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government.

Child support Turuki Tamariki IR1023 | July 2023 ird.govt.nz/childsupportThe information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. This factsheet tells you when a non-parent carer can apply for child support. Who is a non-parent carer? You are a non-parent carer if you provide care for a child but you are not the child's parent. For example, • a grandparent • another family member • a family friend • a guardian • any other person who provides ongoing daily care. Being eligible for child support As a non-parent carer, you are eligible for child support if: • you care for the child at least 128 nights a year (at least 35% of the time) • you are not living in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with the child's parent • you are not receiving board and lodging payments from Oranga Tamariki—Ministry for Children. If you receive an unsupported child's benefit, you will need to apply for child support when you apply for the benefit from Work and Income. How to apply for a formula assessment You can apply for child support against each parent of the child in your care by completing an Application to assess child support by a non-parent carer - IR954 form. We will assess and collect any child support payable. When you apply for the unsupported child's benefit, you will complete this form at Work and Income and they will send it to us. If your benefit is cancelled or you do not receive an unsupported child's benefit You can do one of the following: • make a private arrangement with the parents and tell us to stop collecting your child support • make a voluntary child support agreement with the parents, which we can administer for you • continue your child support formula assessment. The child support will be paid to you • apply for a child support formula assessment. Child support - non-parent carers Private arrangements You can make a private child support arrangement with either parent or with both parents. You do not need to involve us, as long as you do not receive an unsupported child's benefit for the child. Voluntary agreements Working out your own agreement gives you and the parent(s) certainty, because you decide on an amount of child support that you both agree is fair. You can change the amount payable at any time, but you both have to agree to any changes. You can register your agreement with us and we will administer the payments. To find out more or register a voluntary agreement, complete a Registration of voluntary agreement for child support – IR102 form. Go to ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Managing your child support If we accept your application to receive child support, we'll create child support records for you, the child and their parents. We will contact you if we need more information. Otherwise, you and the parents will each receive a letter from us confirming that child support records exist and what this means for each of you. ird.govt.nzThe information in this document was current at the time of publication. Refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Payment waiver Non-parent carers can waive the right to receive child support from one of the parents as long as they are not receiving an unsupported child's benefit for the child. An assessment is still completed for that parent but we will tell them they do not need to make payments. When and how you get paid Child support is usually due to be paid by the liable parents on the 20th of the following month. If they pay on time, we will pay you by the 23rd of the month. For example, a child support payment for August is due on 20 September. If it is paid on time, we will pay you by 23 September. If you receive an unsupported child's benefit for the child in your care, we will pass the payments from the liable parent on to the government to help cover the cost of your benefit. You will receive any amount left over. Example You have two children in your care, Sky and Mia. You are receiving unsupported child's benefit of $800 for Sky only. Your child support entitlement from Sky's parents is $1,000 a month and from Mia's parents is $500 a month. When Sky's parents pay the government will receive $800 and you will get $200 a month. When Mia's parents pay you will receive $500. Cancelling your child support formula assessment You can cancel child support if you are not receiving an unsupported child's benefit. To cancel your child support, you need to complete a Cancelling your child support - IR107 form.

Individuals Ngā Hunga Takitahi IR 1024 | May 2014 Have you ever withdrawn or transferred a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme while you were a New Zealand tax resident? The lump sum could be taxable. This factsheet gives you an overview of the rules. For more detailed information, go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/ If you’ve withdrawn or transferred a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, you may need to pay income tax on the amount. How it works depends on when the lump sum was withdrawn, and how you’ve accounted for your scheme in the past. Definitions Foreign superannuation scheme: A scheme created outside New Zealand to provide people with retirement benefits (eg, United Kingdom pension schemes). This definition doesn’t include schemes set up under another country’s social security legislation. Lump sum: A single payment paid to you directly, or transferred to your New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. A lump sum does not include a pension paid regularly to you from a foreign superannuation scheme (which is generally taxable in full when received). Exemptions Four-year exemption A four-year lump sum exemption period generally applies to lump sums received on or after 1 April 2014, if you have not previously had an exemption period. The exemption period starts from the date you become a New Zealand resident. It runs until the end of 48 months from the beginning of the month after the one in which you become a New Zealand resident. If y ou receive a lump sum within the first four years of becoming a New Zealand tax resident, you won’t have to pay tax on the amount you receive. Australia to New Zealand transfers The Australian transfer exemption is effective from 1 April 2010. This means that when you transfer/withdraw a lump sum from an Australian scheme into New Zealand, this is not taxable. But if you transfer/withdraw a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme into an Australian scheme, this is taxable. Foreign to foreign superannuation transfer A transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme (that is not in Australia) is not taxable income from 1 April 2014. Tax rules for foreign superannuation lump sums Lump sum received from 1 April 2014 In most cases, you’ll need to pay income tax on the lump sum, unless you qualify for an exemption. You can calculate the tax using the “schedule method” or the “formula method”. The schedule method is the default method. The formula method is complex and we recommend you get advice from a tax agent. If you accounted for the income from your scheme under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules and filed a tax return before 20 May 2013, you can continue using the FIF rules from 1 April 2014. You won’t need to pay tax under the new rules when you eventually withdraw or transfer your lump sum. If you stopped using the FIF rules you’ll have to pay tax on the lump sum using the schedule or formula method after 1 April 2014. The schedule and formula methods are only available if you were non-resident when you first acquired the rights in your scheme. The schedule method Under the schedule method you pay tax on a percentage of the lump sum. The percentage varies according to how long you’ve been a New Zealand tax resident. Follow these steps to calculate the percentage. 1. Work out the last day of your four-year exemption period. Or if you don’t have an exemption period, the last day you were non-resident while holding the interest in your scheme. 2. Note the income year in which this date falls (call this year A). 3. Note the income year\* in which you withdraw the lump sum (call this year B). 4. Subtract year A from year B. The resulting number gives you the “year” to use in the table over the page. (If the result is zero, you need to use year 1.) 5. Find your percentage. You will use this percentage when calculating your income for tax purposes. If you’ve made contributions while you were a New Zealand tax resident, this may affect your income under the schedule method. \* For most people, the income year runs from 1 April to 31 March. That means their 2010 income year covered the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010. www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Example Steve became a New Zealand tax resident on 21 February 2006. On 12 August 2018, he withdrew $25,000 from his foreign superannuation scheme. He made no other withdrawals, and no further contributions were made after 21 February 2006. Stev e’s four-year exemption expired on 28 February 2010, which is in the 2010 income year (year A). The lump sum was withdrawn in the 2019 income year (year B).   Year B (2019) − year A (2010) = 9, so the  percentage to use is 40.26%. Steve must include assessable income of $10,065 in his 2019 tax return (40.26% x $25,000 = $10,065). The formula method You can only use this option if you have a defined contribution scheme. Under the formula method, you are taxed on the actual gains of your foreign superannuation scheme interest between the date your four-year exemption expires and the date you receive the lump sum. For more information, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: formula method). Lump sum received before 1 April 2014 If you used the tax rules correctly while you were a member of the scheme, or you withdrew the lump sum during the time you qualified for a temporary tax exemption on foreign income, you won’t have to pay any further tax. Find out about eligibility for this exemption at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: temporary tax exemption). If you transferred/withdrew your lump sum between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014, and you did not comply with the tax rules at the time, you have two options. • You can include as income 15% of your lump sum in your 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return as overseas income. • You can ask us to amend your previous tax returns based on tax rules that applied at the time. You may be liable to pay interest and penalties. We recommend you talk to a tax agent if you’re considering this option. KiwiSaver If you transfer a lump sum to a KiwiSaver scheme, you may have to pay income tax and student loan repayments. You can withdraw funds from your KiwiSaver account to pay Inland Revenue. Contact your scheme provider for details. Working for Families Tax Credits, student loans, child support and provisional tax Your increase in taxable income may have affected these obligations or entitlements. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/ to find out how your lump sum affects these payments. Double tax agreements New Zealand may have a double tax agreement with the country that your scheme is based in. The terms of the agreement may affect the extent to which New Zealand may tax your lump sum. These agreements also determine whether you are able to claim a foreign tax credit in your New Zealand income tax return for foreign tax paid, or if you must apply for a refund from the other country’s tax authority. For more information, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: double tax agreement).

Individuals Ngā Hunga Takitahi IR1024 | April 2024 Have you ever withdrawn or transferred a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme while you were a New Zealand tax resident? The lump sum could be taxable. This factsheet gives you an overview of the rules. For more detailed information, go to ird.govt.nz/toii/ If you’ve withdrawn or transferred a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme, you may need to pay income tax on the amount. How it works depends on when the lump sum was withdrawn, and how you’ve accounted for your scheme in the past. Definitions Foreign superannuation scheme: A scheme created outside New Zealand to provide people with retirement benefits (eg, United Kingdom pension schemes). This definition doesn’t include schemes set up under another country’s social security legislation. Lump sum: A single payment paid to you directly, or transferred to your New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. A lump sum does not include a pension paid regularly to you from a foreign superannuation scheme (which is generally taxable in full when received). Exemptions Four-year exemption A four-year lump sum exemption period generally applies to lump sums received on or after 1 April 2014, if you have not previously had an exemption period. The exemption period starts from the date you become a New Zealand resident. It runs until the end of 48 months from the beginning of the month after the one in which you become a New Zealand resident. If you receive a lump sum within the first four years of becoming a New Zealand tax resident, you won’t have to pay tax on the amount you receive. Australia to New Zealand transfers The Australian transfer exemption is effective from 1 April 2010. This means that when you transfer/withdraw a lump sum from an Australian scheme into New Zealand, this is not taxable. But if you transfer/withdraw a lump sum from a foreign superannuation scheme into an Australian scheme, this is taxable. Foreign to foreign superannuation transfer A transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme (that is not in Australia) is not taxable income from 1 April 2014.

(If the result is zero, you need to use year 1.) 5. Find your percentage. 6. Multiply your lump sum by this percentage. 7. Include the result in your IR3 return. \* For most people, the income year runs from 1 April to 31 March. That means their 2010 income year covered the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010. www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

Tax Agents Kaikaute Taake 1 IR1025 | December 2023 Guidelines for electing not to depreciate an asset These guidelines can help tax agents when they send any correspondence or requests to us. Each guideline explains what information needs to be provided so the request can be considered or the return processed as quickly as possible. These guidelines are to help you make your request. They list the information we require before considering your request. These guidelines do not override any legislation, standard practice statements, publications or forms that have been released. Legislation An election not to depreciate an asset is covered under section EE 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. By electing not to depreciate an asset, your client may avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when the asset is disposed of. Information needed Please include the following information when you're making an election as part of your client's tax return for the income year: • name and IRD number • current address • description of the asset the election is being made for • address if the asset is a non-residential building • income year the election is being made for • purchase or acquisition date. You should include any other relevant information. For example, we need to know if the asset: • is newly acquired, or • has changed use from non-business to business. You also need to tell us if this is a retrospective election to not depreciate an asset. Your client can not have already claimed depreciation for this asset in any previous tax year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Once you've notified us of your client's election not to depreciate an asset your client can not claim depreciation on it in future years. Correspondence guidelines Sending us the election You can send this by attaching it to your client's tax return. Further resources For more information about depreciation read our guide Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260 or go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation ird.govt.nz 2 The information in this document was current at the time of publication.

These guidelines do not override any legislation, standard practice statements, publications or forms that have been released. Legislation The Income Tax Act 2007 says that a person, other than a company, who has a ‘permanent place of abode’ in New Zealand is a New Zealand tax resident. Information needed If you need help determining a client’s residency status for tax purposes, please provide us with your client’s IRD number, full name and current address. We also need your client’s: • travel dates to and from New Zealand • destination • intentions about returning to New Zealand to live, and if they are returning, when they expect to do so. This list is a guide only - you’ll need to consider the overall situation when working out whether your client is a New Zealand tax resident. If you’d like our view, you can fill in a New Zealand tax residence questionnaire - IR886. We’ll then advise you about your client’s tax residence status and if they have any future New Zealand tax responsibilities. Other information If your client has strong ties to New Zealand it’s likely that they’ll have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The types of ties that are relevant are: • whether they make trips back to New Zealand and for how long • their past use of the dwelling in New Zealand • their family and social ties Guidelines for determining residency status • their employment, economic and property ties • whether they intend to come back to New Zealand to live and if they do, when. The permanent place of abode test overrides any rules about the number of days your client is out of New Zealand. So your client will still be a New Zealand tax resident as long as they have a permanent place of abode here, even if they’re gone for more than 325 days. If there’s somewhere in New Zealand your client could live, we need to decide whether it’s their permanent place of abode. To do this, we look at all of your client’s circumstances, as shown in the table below. Sending us the information You can send the information by: • a message through myIR • posting it or a completed New Zealand tax residence questionnaire - IR886.

Legislation The Income Tax Act 2007 - section LJ 2(1) and Article 19 of Schedule 1, Double Taxation Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984. About UK pensions Under the double tax agreement (DTA) with the United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand has sole taxing rights to UK pensions received by New Zealand tax residents. This means New Zealand tax residents can not claim any foreign tax credits on their UK pensions in their New Zealand tax return. Information needed If your clients had tax withheld from their pension in the UK or you want to stop any new or further deductions being made from their pension, your client needs to apply for relief from the UK. You’ll need to complete an ‘Application form for relief from UK Income Tax’ available at www.hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/nz\_indiv.pdf and send it to us. The application provides a claim for repayment of UK Income Tax on a pension. We'll process the form and forward it on your client's behalf to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). They'll ask your client's pension provider to stop the deductions in their system. The form will also allow your client to claim back amounts incorrectly withheld in the UK. If your client has previously claimed foreign tax credits on their UK pension, you may consider making a Voluntary disclosure - IR281 to have these removed from your client's returns. If your client was or is a transitional resident, the pension is generally only taxable from the date their transitional residency ends. If so, you'll need to attach details of the transitional residency on a separate sheet and attach it to the HMRC form. For a guide on what you should include see the Commissioner's operation position on foreign tax credits for amounts withheld from United Kingdom pension. Other information If interest has been charged, it’s possible to apply for remission of any use-of-money interest. Please include this in your request. If your client has difficulty paying any of the outstanding New Zealand tax you should contact us. It may be possible to enter into an instalment arrangement or apply for relief from outstanding tax if recovery would place them in hardship.

Guidelines to request a change of balance date Legislation Applications for a non-standard balance date come under section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Why have a non-standard balance date? Some situations make it impractical for your client to have a 31 March balance date. The seasonable nature of some businesses means that a different tax year may fit better. The law acknowledges this and where you can show that a standard balance date will not work for the business an alternative will be approved. How to apply You can request a balance change through myIR. Information needed When you’re applying, please include all the following details and any other relevant information: • IRD number (or IRD numbers if more than 1 taxpayer, for example, partnership and partners) • each taxpayer’s full name • the balance date you want to use • the reason why your client wants to use a non- standard balance date • your client’s current address. Depending on the reason why your client wants to use a non-standard balance date, you may also want to include: • the names of any associated entities that already use this balance date (and their IRD number if known) • the actual or predicted cashflow, stock patterns, customer demands and seasonal patterns. • other information to show that financial accounts prepared to the proposed balance date would be more appropriate than using a 31 March balance date. Further resources Please refer to Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 18/02 Requests to change a balance date, published in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 30, No 4 (May 2018) for details on the key points for consideration and the procedure for requests.

Legislation The statutory provisions governing the remission of penalties and interest are in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The main provisions relating to remission are in sections: • 183A Remission for reasonable cause • 183ABA Remission due to emergency events • 183D Remission on the grounds of highest net revenue over time. Applying for remission Before making an application for remission it’s important you or your client read the relevant statutory provisions and Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 18/04 (see below for details).

No or inaccurate identification - we can not grant penalty remissions if we can not tell who the application is for or the tax types and tax periods for the remission. Receiving more penalties - certain requests for penalty remission (on the grounds of reasonable cause) can not be considered until the failure to either file the return or pay the assessed tax has been addressed. Penalties may continue to be added in these cases. Extension of time - generally, remission for a late filing penalty will not be granted if you or your client have already been granted some other type of relief, for example, an extension of time. Provisional tax - penalties relating to late provisional tax will not be calculated until the return is filed. Sending us the request You can send us the request via secure mail in myIR.

For a reason other than an obvious error with a tax difference over $10,000 (debit and credit) it cannot be considered by phone and must be requested in writing. Also make sure you notify us of all consequential adjustments that may need to be made to your client's other returns or other taxpayers, including tax types and/ or periods. Process When we receive your request we'll consider it and determine whether an amendment is required and if the request is able to be made. If your request is accepted we'll amend the affected return and issue a correct assessment. If we decline to amend the assessment, we'll advise you in writing. If we need further information, or clarification to verify and quantify the request you've made, we may either decline to make the amendment requested or ask for additional information from you or your client. We will not amend any assessments currently the subject of a dispute. Sending us the request Requests for amendments may be made by: • secure mail • amending the return in myIR • amending the return in gateway services Where a request is more complex we may ask you to put this in writing, especially where there are consequential adjustments that may need to be made to other returns or taxpayers. Further resources Please refer to Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 20/03: Requests to amend assessments (Jun 2020), for details on the procedure for requests.

These guidelines do not override any legislation, standard practice statements, publications or forms that have been released. Legislation There are a number of statutory provisions specifically designed to help customers who have problems paying their tax on time. These provisions vary, depending whether the request is from an individual or a company. You’ll find them in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The main provisions relating to instalment arrangements are in sections: • 139B Late payment penalty • 139BA Suppression of late payment penalty when financial relief is sought • 176 Recovery of tax by the Commissioner • 177 Taxpayer may apply for financial relief • 177A Definition of serious hardship • 177B Instalment arrangements. About instalment arrangements Generally outstanding returns need to be filed and an assessment made before we can consider a request for an instalment arrangement. Before requesting an instalment arrangement it’s important to read the relevant statutory provisions and Standard Practice Statement (SPS) 18/04 (see below for details). There is no standard form to use to make an application. Information needed The following are some things you may want to consider and include in an instalment arrangement application: • clearly identify the customer, including giving us their IRD number, name, last trading address, registered office, and contact person (in case we have further questions) • indicate what tax types and periods the instalment arrangement is for • indicate what the terms of the proposed instalment arrangement are, how much your client is proposing to pay, the payment frequency, for example, weekly, fortnightly or monthly, and how they’ll pay • in some cases you may be asked to complete a Disclosure of financial position - IR590, which is available on our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides • for business customers who have multiple trading entities for which they control, please include bank statements for all accounts together with the associated entities and/or financial statements to help us make a decision about the proposal • include the reasons for requesting an instalment arrangement and whether this will affect the ability of your client to meet their obligations in the future (please be open about the customer’s circumstances) • clarify your client’s financial position. The information required will depend on the size of the debt. Some matters can be dealt with over the phone but for a larger business we’ll ask detailed questions about: - Assets and liabilities - Profit and loss account - Cash flow to demonstrate the proposed instalment arrangement is achievable. If we need more information, we’ll contact you. Credit Offset Future GST refunds will be offset to the instalment arrangement. Refundable tax credits can be refunded on request from you or your client. A refundable tax credit is defined as a tax credit under a provision that is listed in section LA 6(1)(a) to (j). Remaining refundable credits: PAYE, RWT, and certain other items. GST refunds are not a refundable tax credit. Sending us this request You can request an instalment arrangement on behalf of your client from their applicable account in myIR. You are not able to submit payments via direct debit from your clients account unless you have sole signing authority on the account approved by their bank. You can request an instalment arrangement by phone, however, we may ask for more complicated requests to be made in writing via secure mail in myIR. What happens next? The time we take to deal with the request will depend on the size of the debt. Generally, instalment arrangements for larger debts will require more supporting information and go through a longer approval process. While we’re dealing with the request we do not impose certain late payment penalties. If the request is approved, we will not charge those late payment penalties. You can read more about this in section 139BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or in SPS 18/04: Options for relief from tax debt.

Ability to access assets - the financial information provided shows your client has an asset that can be used for borrowing against or sold and so they can pay their tax in full. Lack of evidence to support the request - if there’s no evidence to show that the tax can not be paid as it falls due, we can not make a decision. Incomplete information - bank statements have not been provided for all accounts. Bank statements should be provided for all accounts the client is a signatory over or are held in the client’s name, including joint accounts. Out-of-date information - supporting information provided voluntarily or requested by us is out of date. Out-dated information will not be accepted for decision- making purposes. We’ll usually have to request updated information. Note: When making payments towards an arrangement, please use the tax type ‘ARR’ for automatic payments or on payment slips, so we can allocate any payments correctly. Your client should make the first payment as per the proposal even if we haven’t confirmed the arrangement. If your client has their own debt as well as debt for their related entities, 1 instalment arrangement can be set up to cover both entities as long as you are linked to both accounts.

Business Ngā Ūmanga Ngā tohanga mana Māori Māori authority distributions Use this factsheet if your Māori authority makes distributions to its members. It will help you work out if these are taxable or not and whether taxes must be paid. If your Māori authority makes distributions to its members there are several steps you'll need to take to meet your tax obligations. Distributions Distributions are a transfer of value from a Māori authority to a Māori authority member. It includes payments, kaumatua grants, health and education contributions, accommodation provided, interest-free loans and taxable bonus issues given to a member because of their membership in the Māori authority. Types of distribution Distributions from Māori authorities to their members are either taxable or non-taxable. 1. Taxable distributions are those from: • gross income the Māori authority received in the 2004-05 or subsequent income years • gross income not exempt from tax. 2. Non-taxable distributions which include as their source: • tax paid income earned prior to the 2004-05 income year • exempt income • tax paid income received under other tax-type rules. Use the flowchart over the page to decide if a distribution is taxable or non-taxable to a member. You can find examples of different types of distributions in our guide Māori authority tax rules (IR1202). MACA (Māori authority credit account) Most Māori authorities need to keep an account of any credits they allocate. The MACA shows how much income tax the Māori authority has paid on its income and how much of that tax can be passed on to members as a credit. Your MACA covers the period 1 April to 31 March each year. It will have an opening balance, credit and debit entries and a closing balance. A credit closing balance in a Māori authority credit account means tax credits are available for distribution to its members in the next tax year. Māori authorities can pass on to members the benefit of any tax they've already paid on the Māori authority's income. They do this by attaching credits to the distribution they pay out, so profits aren’t taxed twice. The total amount of credits attached to distributions made throughout the year are recorded as a debit entry in the MACA (IR8J). Resident withholding tax(RWT) reporting requirements If your Māori authority makes a taxable distribution, you must file an RWT return and tell us, the date and total amount of distributions, the total amount of Māori authority credits attached and any other tax credits. You will also need to provide information about the recipients of the distribution. The following information is required: • their name • their contact details - email, street address or mobile phone number • the amount and type of income paid to them • the tax withheld • the date the tax was withheld • the Māori authority credits attached, if any. If it is available, you need to provide the following additional information for each of the recipients: • IRD number • their date of birth. Unless an exemption has been granted, RWT returns must be filed electronically. The RWT return and payment of RWT is due by the 20th of the month following the distribution. You only need to file for the months in which you made a distribution. IR1027 | November 2024 www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. RWT must be deducted if the: • Māori authority decides not to attach any credits to the distribution • credits attached are less than 17.5% of the gross distribution • Māori authority doesn’t hold the member’s IRD number and the distribution exceeds $200 (in which case the tax rate is 39%) reduced by any Māori authority credits attached, up to a maximum rate of 17.5% of the gross. You must deduct RWT at the time the distribution is paid to the member. For this purpose, “pay” means: • distribute to • credit to an account. • deal with a person’s interest or on their behalf. Example: Dealing with a person’s interest or on their behalf A Māori authority declares a distribution for all beneficiaries, calculating the payout and crediting the account of each beneficiary. They make payment to known beneficiaries but some distributions remain unclaimed. The Māori authority is required to account for RWT on the full amount declared not just the amount physically paid to beneficiaries. MACA and distribution statements At the time of making a distribution, the Māori authority must provide a distribution statement to the recipients. The distribution statement must include: • the name of the Māori authority • the name, address, and IRD number of the recipients • the date the distribution was made • the amount of the distribution • what portion is a taxable distribution and what portion is a non-taxable distribution • the total amount of Māori authority credits attached, if any. For more help Our Māori authority tax rules guide (IR1202) explains: • The Māori authority credit system • Making distributions • Filing end-of-year returns. You can get a copy from ird.govt.nz under “Forms and guides”. Kaitakawaenga Māori Most of our offices have a Kaitakawaenga Māori who can assist Māori organisations and individuals with their tax responsibilities. If you have a query, or would like to arrange an advisory visit from a Kaitakawaenga Māori, please call 0800 377 774 or go to ird.govt.nz/kaitakawaenga-maori Note: Taxing distributions and managing a MACA can be complex and this table is only a guide. We suggest you talk to a tax professional. If the distribution is a mixture of taxable and non-taxable sources work out tax on the taxable portion only. Taxable distributions that are exempt income to recipients, such as education grants, must still have tax deducted and the credits passed on to the member. These credits can be claimed by the recipient. Educational grants must meet the requirements under CW 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to be considered exempt income. YesNo Māori authority makes a distribution to a member Is the distribution from a taxable source? Non-taxable distribution No tax is calculated on this distribution Taxable income to the member Exempt income to the member Is the distribution an educational grant or made to a tax exempt charity? Yes No Taxable distribution You must deduct RWT and decide whether to attach a Māori authority credit

Business Ngā Ūmanga Understanding schedular payments for contractors This factsheet tells you about schedular payments and what your obligations as a New Zealand tax resident contractor are if you receive them. There are different rules for non-resident contractors. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: non-resident contractor). What are schedular payments? Payments received under a contract for service for certain activities, eg commissions, director’s fees or labour only contracts in the building industry. Schedular payments are required to have tax deducted by the person paying them (payer). How do I know if my contract payment is a schedular payment? Page three of the Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C) form has a list of schedular payment activities. If your payment isn’t a schedular payment and isn’t salary or wages it’s treated as income from self-employment or business income. For more information see our Smart business (IR320) guide. Labour hire arrangements From 1 April 2017 a new group of contractors come within the schedular payment rules. Tax must be deducted from all payments made to you, on or after 1 April 2017, if you’re working under a labour hire arrangement for a labour hire business. This applies no matter what entity type you are contracting under, eg, individual, partnership, company. If you’re also an associated party of the labour hire business you are working for, tax may not have to be deducted. Find out more on our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: labour hire). What is a labour hire arrangement? A labour hire arrangement is where a person is paid by a labour hire business to perform work or services directly for clients of the business or other person, instead of performing work or services for the business itself. The client will pay the labour hire business who will pay the worker. Other names for labour hire business Labour hire businesses may also be known as: • on-hire business • employment agency • contract management • recruitment services You can find more information about labour hire arrangements and labour hire businesses on our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: labour hire). What do I need to give to my payer? From 1 April 2017 if: • you’re new to the schedular payment rules, eg, working under a labour hire arrangement for a labour hire business, • you start with a new payer, or • you want to change your tax rate you’ll need to complete a Tax rate notification for contractors (IR330C) form and give this to your payer. This tells your payer what tax rate you’ve chosen. What tax rate do I use? You can choose to use the standard tax rate for your type of work shown on page three of the IR330C or pick your own rate, provided it's not less than the minimum 10%, or 15% if you have a temporary entry class visa. Our Tax rate estimation tool (for contractors) can help you choose a rate. You'll find this on our website www.ird.govt.nz under "Work it out". If you choose a rate too low for your circumstances, you may not pay enough towards your end of year tax obligation. This may result in you having to pay further tax in a lump sum and be liable for provisional tax.

You'll need to know your IRD number and have access to the email address we hold for you. www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Can I change the rate I've chosen? If your circumstances change you can choose a new tax rate by completing a new IR330C and giving it to your payer. You can only choose a new tax rate twice within a 12 month period, with the same payer. If you need to change your rate more than twice in a 12 month period you'll need the agreement of your payer. If you're starting with a new payer you can choose any rate you want, subject to the minimums. It doesn't have to be the same rate you have with another payer. Show this rate on the IR330C form you give this payer. What happens if I don't complete an IR330C? If you don't complete an IR330C your payer has to deduct tax at the no-notification rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Certificate of exemption If you have a good record of tax compliance you can apply for a certificate of exemption (COE) so no tax is deducted from your payment. You'll still be required to pay tax on your income at the end of the year, and you may be liable for provisional tax. Apply online through our website www.ird.govt.nz "Work it out" or use the Request a certificate of exemption from tax on schedular payments (IR332) form. Once you've received a COE show this to your payer. You don't need to complete an IR330C as well. If you're receiving payments under a labour hire arrangement from a labour hire business you won't be able to use a COE for these payments. You'll have to apply for a 0% special tax rate using the Special tax code application (IR23BS). Special tax rate If the minimum rate you are able to choose is too high for your circumstances, eg, you have losses to carry forward, you can apply for a special tax rate which allows you to use a rate lower than the minimum. Use the IR23BS form to apply for a special tax rate. Once you've received a special tax rate certificate show this to your payer, along with the IR330C. Voluntary schedular payments If you receive income (not salary or wages) that isn't subject to the schedular payment rules you can opt in to have tax deducted from your payments. These payments will be treated as schedular payments. To opt in you need to get the agreement of your payer. Once you have their agreement you'll need to put it in writing and make sure your payer has a copy. It's recommended the agreement include: • your name and the name of your payer, • agreement all payments made to you will be treated as voluntary schedular payments, • the period the agreement applies to, • date of the agreement, and • signatures of you and your payer. You'll need to give your payer a completed IR330C showing the tax rate you want to use.

Business Ngā Ūmanga Automatic Exchange of Information Your obligations if you hold or control financial accounts What is Automatic Exchange of Information? New Zealand is one of many countries that has committed to new global standards on the automatic exchange of financial account information (AEOI). This information is required by la w to be collected by financial institutions around the world for reporting to tax authorities. Tax authorities will exchange this information to ensure everyone pays the right amount of tax. Four broad categories of financial institution are covered by AEOI – custodial institutions, depository institutions, investment entities and specified insurance companies. Apart from more obvious entities such as banks, this can also include non-bank deposit takers, collective investment entities, mutual funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, discretionary investment managers, certain brokers and trusts (including some managed family trusts). The New Zealand Government has enacted specific laws to implement AEOI with: • the United States (US) under a system known as the F oreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). This is for US citizens and tax residents only (including certain US entities), and has applied from 1 July 2014, and • other countries under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). The CRS has applied from 1 July 2017. What does this mean for me? In order to hold a financial account in New Zealand, you are required by law to comply with all AEOI obligations. Note: If you do not comply with all of your AEOI obligations then the financial institution may not open an account for you, and/or may freeze or close your account. If you have a pre-existing account If you have a pre-existing account with a financial institution as at 30 June 2017, your financial institution may contact you to confirm your country or countries of tax residence (or the country of tax residence of the person(s) you hold funds for). This is to establish whether you have accounts that need to be reported under the AEOI laws. They may also contact you if their records indicate that you (or a person that you hold funds for) could be a foreign tax resident. This might be because you have provided an address or other information for a country outside New Zealand. If you open a new account From 1 July 2017, if you open a new account your financial institution must generally ask you to self- certify your tax residence. They may ask you to complete forms and documentation, and provide other information to identify where you are a tax resident. Your financial institution may also contact you for this information for your pre-existing accounts. A self-certification may sometimes not be required if you already have a pre-existing account with the financial institution. Accounts held by entities (eg companies, trusts, partnerships) From 1 July 2017, if you are opening a new account on behalf of a legal entity (such as a company) or arrangement (such as a trust or partnership), your financial institution must generally obtain a self-certification from you to determine whether the account is reportable. The institution may ask you for information about: •the entity’s tax residence •the nature of the entity’ s business •how the entity derives its income •how the entity is managed •the nature of the entity’ s assets, and • in some circumstances, the tax residence of individuals who control the entit y. Your financial institution may also contact you for this information for your pre-existing accounts. This will help the institution to comply with their obligations under the AEOI laws. Self-certification may sometimes not be required if you already have a pre-existing account with the financial institution. Requests for information It is important that you respond truthfully and to the best of your knowledge, within a reasonable timeframe, if you receive a request for details about: • your tax residency and related information •the nature of your entity •the tax residency and related information of the person(s) y ou hold an account for. If you, your entity or person(s) you hold an account for, are identified as a foreign tax resident: • you will need to provide your or the relevant person(s) date of birth and foreign taxpayer identification number (TIN) or equivalent. This is the number used to identify IR1033 | May 2018 www.ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. you or relevant person(s) to the tax authority in the foreign country. If you or the relevant person(s) don’t have a TIN (or equivalent), you will be asked to provide a reason • the entity will need to provide its foreign TIN (or equivalent). You must take reasonable steps to obtain and provide this information. You must also provide an update if there is a material change to the information you have provided. If you don’t respond, your financial institution may have to treat you, your entity or the person(s) you hold an account for as being a foreign tax resident in a country outside New Zealand, even if you are not. Note: If you intend to open a new account and do not provide the relevant information, the financial institution must not open the account. Account freezing and closure If the financial institution does open your account then it is legally required to also check whether the account information you provided is correct. As part of this process you may be asked to provide additional information and documentation. 1 Note: If you do not respond correctly and completely to their requests for information then the financial institution might freeze and/or close your account. Penalties Penalties under the AEOI laws may apply if you provide false or misleading information, fail to provide this information, or fail to provide an update if there is a material change to the information you have provided. This includes civil penalties of $1,000 per offence that we can impose. Substantial criminal penalties can be imposed by the courts for knowledge-based offences. These penalties apply for the purposes of both CRS and FATCA. These requirements help ensure the AEOI laws worldwide are effective. They increase tax transparency by identifying people who have offshore accounts and investments. Other countries that are implementing the AEOI have similar provisions in place. What happens with my financial account information? If you, your entity or the person(s) you hold an account for are identified or treated as being a foreign tax resident, under the AEOI laws, identity details, account balance, income and payment information, and other account information may be provided to us. We will then send the information to the tax authority in the jurisdictions(s) of tax residence, if New Zealand has an AEOI with that jurisdiction. We may also use this information to assist in making sure that everyone pays the right amount of tax as per our responsibilities under the Tax Administration Act 1994. If you are a New Zealand tax resident and you have accounts with financial institutions overseas, we may receive such information from the tax authority of that jurisdiction(s). This will mean that we receive better information about New Zealand tax residents’ offshore investments, which will assist us with making sure everyone pays the right amount of tax. All information reported under these laws is handled in the strictest confidence by us and foreign tax authorities. National laws, administrative practices, and binding international treaties protect the privacy and confidentiality of your information. This is in the same way that all taxpayer information is generally handled. Disclaimer This information is a high level summary, with some exceptions, to help you understand your obligations under the AEOI laws in New Zealand.

If your band is successful, your hobby can turn into a business and you'll have legal and tax responsibilities. Is your entertainment activity a business? If you entertain on a regular basis with the intention of making a profit, either as an individual or as a group, it's likely you’re in business. If you charge for your services, the venue owner is usually required to deduct tax from payments made to you. These are known as schedular payments. Example: Your band performs for the Big Grey hotel. You charge $1,000 for the evening. The hotel owner/ manager deducts tax of 20% ($200) and pays your band the rest ($800). Payment can include koha, tips and payment in kind, that is, the same value of money in food, drink or other goods or services. What you need to know There are a few things you need to think about and your answers will determine who's responsible for the tax on the income you receive - you or the venue owner. • Does each band member get paid individually and meet their own costs and tax? Large groups can elect an informal leader to take care of all the business and keep a schedule of payments. • Have you given the venue owner a completed Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C? They'll use this to deduct the correct rate of tax from the payment you receive. • Does the band trade as a partnership or a company? If it does, it should have its own IRD number and file partnership or company tax returns. Note: If you (or the band) trades as a company you only need to complete a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C if you're also a non-resident entertainer, or if you're performing the work under a labour hire arrangement. If you're a non-resident entertainer, find out about your tax responsibilities at ird.govt.nz/nr-entertainers or call us on 09 984 4329. Certificate of exemption (COE) You may be eligible to get a certificate of exemption. You show this to the venue owner and it tells them to pay you the full fee and not to deduct tax. You're then responsible for paying the tax on this income at the end of the tax year. To find out how to apply for a COE go to ird.govt.nz/apply-for-coe Paying taxes and filing returns Payments you receive for your entertainment activity will, in most cases, be taxable. You should put a portion of each payment into a separate bank account. At the end of each tax year (31 March) you'll need to complete and send us a tax return. If you have a tax agent they'll manage this for you. You still need to give them your business records. Even if venue owners have deducted tax you must still file a tax return. You could consider appointing a tax agent (accountant). They can help you work out your taxes and complete your tax returns. The fee you pay them is tax deductible. Tax information for bands and entertainers If you're an entertainer or in a band, this factsheet will help you work out if you need to pay tax. Mickey J Moose 112211221 ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. Keeping business records Keeping the right information is important and, in most cases, a legal requirement. This includes: • having a separate bank account to help you manage your income and expenses and budget for tax and other business costs such as ACC levies • an accounting system to record income and expenses (an accounts book or software package) • assets register for instruments and equipment • keeping all business invoices and receipts for seven years • running a vehicle logbook so you can claim travel costs. Do you need to register for GST? You may need to register for GST. You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help - Do I need to register for GST? You can register for GST in myIR If you register for GST you’ll need to provide the venue owner with taxable supply information such as an invoice. You’ll need to work out the GST to pay to us. You can find out more about taxable supply information and calculating and paying GST on our website at ird.govt.nz/gst When you're paid from the door charges If you collect door charges which you later receive as your fee, the tax on them is paid in one of 2 ways. 1. You do this by yourself - the manager or licensee deducts the tax from these payments at the rate shown on the IR330C and pays you the difference. 2. You and an employee of the venue owner collect door charges together and you keep the money as your fee - the manager or licensee doesn't have to make any deductions from these payments, so you have to pay the income tax. You should put some of each payment aside and keep records so you can show this in your tax return at the end of the year. No You're an individual or a member of a band You have a current certificate of exemption You are responsible for your own income tax Yes Put some of your earnings into a separate account File a tax return by 7 July Pay your tax by 7 February the following year The venue deducts tax from your payment.

If you hire them under a contract for service, you usually have to deduct tax in the form of schedular payments. What you need to know If the band members are operating as individuals you need a completed Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C from each of them. The payments you make to the entertainers differ from wages because they're paid to independent contractors. How to deduct income tax from their fee Step 1. Deduct income tax from their payment at the rate chosen on their IR330C. If they don’t select a tax rate, use the standard rate on the last page of the IR330C. Step 2. Include the gross schedular payment amount and total tax deducted on your Employment information - IR348. Note: An individual may have a certificate of exemption. This means you don't have to deduct tax from their payment. You need to see the original certificate and check that it's current. You won't need to make other deductions such as KiwiSaver or student loan repayments because these are the entertainer's responsibility. Different tax rules apply to non-resident entertainers. For more information please go to ird.govt.nz/nr-entertainers Entertainers operating as a partnership or company If the band has its own IRD number you need a completed Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C in the band's name. You won't need an IR330C or to deduct tax from the payment if the band: • holds a current certificate of exemption, or • is a limited liability company. If they're non-resident entertainers you must still deduct tax from their payment. For more on non-resident entertainers go to ird.govt.nz/nr-entertainers Special tax rate certificate An entertainer may give you a special tax rate certificate. It will tell you to deduct tax at a special rate, or to deduct no tax. Paying the band from door charges Payments you make to the band from door charges are treated in two ways: 1. The entertainer takes the door money - you're responsible for deducting income tax from these payments at the rate shown on the IR330C and paying them the difference. 2. The entertainer takes the money jointly with an employee of the venue and keeps the money as their fee - you don't deduct income tax from these payments.

IR1037 | August 2022 Use this factsheet if you're a boarding service provider, have a homestay, students or flatmates paying to live in your home. It will help you to work out if you need to declare this income for tax purposes. Providing accommodation in your private home, sleep-out or caravan on your property - including to your own relatives - may be considered taxable income. We recognise that you'll have costs in providing accommodation so we explain the options to work out if you have income you'll need to pay tax on. Boarders in private homes To work out the income from your boarding services you can choose to use the standard cost method or actual cost method. You don't have to tell us what method you elect to use, but if you don't complete a return of income by the due date for filing, we'll assume you chose the standard cost method. Note: These rules don’t apply to flatmates. Standard cost method The standard cost method consists of two calculations: • the weekly standard cost per boarder • the annual capital standard cost. 1. Weekly standard cost This rate applies for each boarder or home-stay student you have, up to a maximum of 4. Note: You can’t use the weekly standard cost method if you have five or more boarders. Instead, you complete a tax return and include all payments received as income. You can claim expenses as long as they’re allowed under our tax rules and you keep records to support your claim. If your income is less than the weekly standard cost allowed, you don't need to show this income in your return, keep records of related costs, or pay tax on the income you receive from boarders. The weekly standard costs change every year. You can find the latest rates at ird.govt.nz/boarders If your income is more than the weekly standard cost allowed, read on. Boarders, flatmates and tenants - tax responsibilities 2. Annual capital standard cost Only use this calculation when your income from boarders is more than the weekly standard cost. The formula represents the cost of using your private home to provide private boarding services, and includes financing and depreciation costs. Don't include any of these in your calculation: • a child under 18 who accompanies a parent or guardian where there's no separate charge for the child's keep • a child over five who's in a shared custody arrangement and they live with you (as the provider) for less than six months • a dependent child attending boarding school or living elsewhere for more than half of the year. Income to be included in your return The amount of income you declare depends on the number of boarders you have at any time in a year and if the income exceeds the weekly standard cost rate. To work out how much, if any, income to show in your return, you can use the IR1125 Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding service at ird.govt.nz/boarders ird.govt.nz The information in this document was current at the time of publication. Please refer to our website for the most up-to-date information. You'll need this information when you use this worksheet: 1. You own the home - the purchase price of your house - the value of any improvements to the house - the value of any accomodation supplement you receive. 2. You rent your home - weekly amount of rent you pay - the value of any accomodation supplement you receive. Who should declare the income? If you provide boarding services with your spouse or partner, the person most directly involved on a day-to-day basis should declare the income. Rental property owned by a family trust If you provide boarding services from a home in a family trust and you're a beneficiary of the trust, you can only calculate the standard cost for the annual capital component based on any rent paid. Any rent claimed will be based on: • the period the boarding service is provided • the proportion of boarders compared to the average number of household occupants. Use this calculation to work out the rent you claim: Rent claimable = annual rent paid × service period × number of boarders 1 52 weeks average household number Actual cost method If you use this method you have to keep full records of your income and expenses for the year. You'll also need to complete a tax return to declare any profit or claim any loss. More information You can find full details in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 10 (December 2005). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Flatmates and tenants In most flatting situations payments made by one flatmate to another as a share of the overall cost of the accommodation isn't likely to be classed as taxable income. But if one flatmate (usually the house owner) sets out to profit from the contributions of others who share the accommodation, this profit is income. If you're in this situation you need to declare this as income. Use the ordinary tax rules (rental income, less allowable expenses) to work out the final amount to put in your end-of-year tax return. If you live in a property and have other tenants living in another part of your multi-flat building you must declare your rental income. Use one of the following methods to work out which expenses you can claim against your rental income: 1. Keep a record of the expenses that relate to the part of the property you're renting out, and claim these as costs against your income. 2. Keep a record of your total expenses for the property, and apportion these according to the area of the rented-out part. For example, if you rent out a flat that takes up a quarter of the area of your house, you can claim 25% of the house expenses.
