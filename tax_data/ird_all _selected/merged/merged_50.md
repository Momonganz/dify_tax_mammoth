ARTICLE 4 Resident 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the terms “resident of Canada” and “resident of New Zealand” mean respectively any person who is resident in Canada for the purposes of Canadian tax and any person who is resident in New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax. 2. A resident of a Contracting State also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. 3.

In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to claim any relief or exemption from tax provided by the Convention. ARTICLE 5 Permanent Establishment 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; and (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place relating to the exploration for or the exploitation of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 12 months. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if, for more than 183 days in any 12-month period: (a) it carries on activities which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State: (a) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12-month period, and more than 50 per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in that other State through that individual; or (b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12-month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State, the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3 and 4, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. III. TAXATION OF INCOME ARTICLE 6 Income from Immovable Property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has for the purposes of the relevant tax law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. ARTICLE 7 Business Profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where: (a) a resident of Canada beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in New Zealand by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of Canada, a permanent establishment in New Zealand, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in New Zealand by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in New Zealand and the resident’s share of profits that is attributable to that permanent establishment may be taxed in New Zealand. 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, an enterprise of a Contracting State that derives income from any form of insurance, other than life insurance, from the other State in the form of premiums paid for the insurance of risks situated in that other State, may to that extent be taxed in the other State in accordance with the law of that other State relating specifically to the taxation of any person who derives such income. However, the amount of the income so derived that may be taxed in that other State in accordance with this paragraph shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross premiums receivable, except where the income so derived is attributable to a permanent establishment of an enterprise of the first-mentioned State, in which case the other provisions of this Article shall apply. ARTICLE 8 Ship and Aircraft Operations 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from the carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. ARTICLE 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where: (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State; or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. A Contracting State shall not change the income of an enterprise in the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1 after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after eight years from the end of the taxable year in which the income which would be subject to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in paragraph 1, have accrued to that enterprise. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. ARTICLE 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company that holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and (b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends, in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends arising in a Contracting State and paid to the other Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof or to any wholly-owned agency or instrumentality of that State, political subdivision or local authority that performs functions of a governmental nature, shall be taxable only in that other State. However, this provision shall only apply in circumstances as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares and other income subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 7. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing Canada from imposing a tax on the earnings attributable to permanent establishments in Canada of a company which is a resident of New Zealand, in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of Canada, provided that the rate of any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 5 per cent of the amount of such earnings which have not been subjected to such additional tax in previous taxation years. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “earnings” means profits attributable to such permanent establishments in Canada (including gains from the alienation of property forming part of the business property, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 13, of such permanent establishments) in accordance with Article 7 in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom: (a) business losses attributable to such permanent establishments (including losses from the alienation of property forming part of the business property of such permanent establishments) in such year and previous years; (b) all taxes chargeable in Canada on such profits, other than the additional tax referred to herein; (c) the profits reinvested in Canada, provided that the amount of such deduction shall be determined in accordance with the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the computation of the allowance in respect of investment in property in Canada, and any subsequent modification of those provisions which shall not affect the general principle hereof; and (d) five hundred thousand Canadian dollars ($500,000), less any amount deducted: (i) by the company, or (ii) by a person related thereto from the same or a similar business as that carried on by the company, under this subparagraph (d); for the purposes of this subparagraph (d), a company is related to another company if one company directly or indirectly controls the other, or both companies are directly or indirectly controlled by the same person or persons, or if the two companies deal with each other not at arm’s length. 8. The provisions of paragraph 7 shall also apply with respect to earnings derived from the alienation of immovable property in Canada by a company carrying on a trade in immovable property, whether or not it has a permanent establishment in Canada, but only insofar as these earnings may be taxed in Canada under the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 13. 9. No relief shall be available under this Article if it is the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the dividends, or with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends and the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2: (a) interest arising in New Zealand and paid to a resident of Canada shall be taxable only in Canada if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by Export Development Canada; (b) interest arising in Canada and paid to a resident of New Zealand shall be taxable only in New Zealand if it is paid in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or a credit extended, guaranteed or insured by any body in New Zealand of a similar nature to Export Development Canada as may be agreed upon between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if the interest is derived by a financial institution which is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance. 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, interest referred to in that paragraph may be taxed in the State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if: (a) in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph (a) shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds 2 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, “approved issuer levy” includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; (b) it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to back-to-back loans; or (c) all or any portion of the interest is paid or payable on an obligation that is contingent or dependent on the use of or production from property or is computed by reference to revenue, profit, cash flow, commodity price or any other similar criterion or by reference to dividends paid or payable to shareholders of any class of shares of the capital stock of a corporation. 6. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the laws of the State in which the income arises. However, the term “interest” does not include income dealt with in Article 10. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 8. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 9. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 10. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the assignment of the interest, the creation or assignment of the debt-claim or other rights in respect of which the interest is paid, or the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of the person which is the beneficial owner of the interest or the conduct of its operations, to take advantage of this Article. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties if they are: (i) copyright royalties and other like payments in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or other artistic work (excluding royalties in respect of motion picture films and royalties in respect of works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television broadcasting), or (ii) royalties for the use of, or the right to use, computer software or any patent or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience (but not including any such royalty provided in connection with a rental or franchise agreement); (b) 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties in all other cases. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula, or process or other intangible property; (b) the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; (c) information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (d) the use of, or the right to use: (i) motion picture films, (ii) films, videotapes or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television, or (iii) tapes for use in connection with radio broadcasting; (e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c); or (f) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the profits attributable to that permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 7. No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with an assignment of the royalties, or with the creation or assignment of the rights in respect of which the royalties are paid or credited, to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment. In any case where a Contracting State intends to apply this paragraph, the competent authority of that State shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 13 Alienation of Property 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of: (a) shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State; or (b) an interest in a partnership, trust or other entity, deriving more than 50 per cent of its value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Convention affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. 6. Where an individual who ceases to be a resident of a Contracting State, and immediately thereafter becomes a resident of the other Contracting State, is treated for the purposes of taxation in the first-mentioned State as having alienated a property (in this paragraph referred to as the “deemed alienation”) and is taxed in that State by reason thereof, the individual may elect to be treated for purposes of taxation in the other State as if the individual had, immediately before becoming a resident of that State, sold and repurchased the property for an amount equal to the lesser of its fair market value at the time of the deemed alienation and the amount the individual elects, at the time of the actual alienation of the property, to be the proceeds of disposition in the first-mentioned State in respect of the deemed alienation. However, this provision shall not apply to property any gain from which, arising immediately before the individual became a resident of that other State, may be taxed in that other State or to immovable property situated in a third State. ARTICLE 14 Income from Employment 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 12 month period commencing or ending in the taxation year concerned; and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State; and (c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State in international traffic shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State. ARTICLE 15 Directors’ Fees Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. ARTICLE 16 Entertainers and Sportspersons 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply if it is established that neither the entertainer or the sportsperson nor persons related to them participate directly or indirectly in the profits of the person referred to in that paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived from activities performed in a Contracting State by a resident of the other Contracting State in the context of a visit in the first-mentioned State of a non-profit organization of the other State, if the visit is wholly or mainly supported by public funds. ARTICLE 17 Pensions 1. Pensions and annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Pensions arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State. However, in the case of periodic pension payments, the tax so charged shall not exceed the lesser of: (a) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the payment; and (b) the amount of tax that the recipient of the payment would otherwise be required to pay for the year on the total amount of the periodic pension payments received by the individual in the year, if the individual were resident in the Contracting State in which the payment arises. 3. Annuities arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the State in which they arise and according to the law of that State, but the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the portion thereof that is subject to tax in that State. However, this limitation does not apply to lump-sum payments arising on the surrender, cancellation, redemption, sale or other alienation of an annuity. 4. Notwithstanding anything in this Convention: (a) war pensions and allowances (including pensions and allowances paid to war veterans or paid as a consequence of damages or injuries suffered as a consequence of a war) arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in that other State to the extent that they would be exempt from tax if received by a resident of the first-mentioned State; and (b) alimony and other similar payments arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State who is subject to tax therein in respect thereof shall be taxable only in that other State, but the amount taxable in that other State shall not exceed the amount that would be taxable in the first-mentioned State if the recipient were a resident thereof. 5. For the purposes of this Article, the term “pension” includes any payment made under a sickness, accident or disability plan, as well as any payment made under the social security legislation in a Contracting State. 6. For the purposes of this Article, the term “annuity” means a stated sum paid periodically at stated times during life or during a specified number of years, under an obligation to make the payments in return for adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth (other than services rendered), but does not include a payment that is not a periodic payment or any annuity the cost of which was deductible in whole or in part for the purposes of taxation in the Contracting State in which it was acquired. ARTICLE 18 Government Service 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State, or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 or 16 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision thereof. ARTICLE 19 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is, or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State, a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of that individual’s education or training receives for the purpose of that individual’s maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 20 Other Income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. Where such income is income from a trust resident in Canada, other than a trust to which contributions were deductible, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the income if the beneficial owner is a resident of New Zealand, provided that the income is taxable in New Zealand. IV. ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION ARTICLE 21 Elimination of Double Taxation 1. In the case of Canada, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: (a) subject to the existing provisions of the law of Canada regarding the deduction from tax payable in Canada of tax paid in a territory outside Canada and to any subsequent modification of those provisions - which shall not affect the general principle hereof - and unless a greater deduction or relief is provided under the laws of Canada, tax payable in New Zealand on profits, income or gains arising in New Zealand shall be deducted from any Canadian tax payable in respect of such profits, income or gains; (b) where, in accordance with any provision of the Convention, income derived by a resident of Canada is exempt from tax in Canada, Canada may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on other income take into account the exempted income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Canadian tax paid under the laws of Canada and consistent with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Canada (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of a Contracting State which may be taxed in the other Contracting State in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in that other State. V. SPECIAL PROVISIONS ARTICLE 22 Non-Discrimination 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith that is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. 3. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises which are residents of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. 5. In this Article, the term “taxation” means taxes which are the subject of this Convention. ARTICLE 23 Mutual Agreement Procedure 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, address to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident an application in writing stating the grounds for claiming the revision of such taxation. To be admissible, the application must be submitted within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority referred to in paragraph 1 shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. A Contracting State shall not, after the expiry of the time limits provided in its domestic laws and, in any case, after eight years from the end of the taxable period to which the income concerned was attributed, change the income of a resident of either of the Contracting States by including therein items of income which have also been included in income in the other Contracting State. This paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. 5. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention and may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of applying the Convention. ARTICLE 24 Exchange of Information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to taxes, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because the information relates to ownership interests in a person. 6. Authorized representatives of a Contracting State shall be permitted to enter the other Contracting State to interview individuals or examine a person’s books and records, with their consent, in accordance with procedures mutually agreed upon by the competent authorities. ARTICLE 25 Assistance in the Collection of Taxes 1. The Contracting States undertake to lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article, including agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance. 2. The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description collected, by or on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection related to such amount. This Article only applies to revenue claims that are in respect of a tax year that commences after a date that is five years before the date on which this Convention enters into force. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim may, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. Where an application for collection of a revenue claim is accepted, that revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 shall not, in that State, be accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. A revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be enforced by imprisonment of the debtor in the other Contracting State. 5. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 6. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 7. Unless the competent authorities otherwise agree, ordinary costs incurred in providing collection assistance in respect of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall be borne by the other Contracting State and any agreed extraordinary costs incurred shall be borne by the first-mentioned State. 8. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public); (c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection available under its laws or administrative practice; (d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. ARTICLE 26 Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts 1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4, an individual who is a member of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a Contracting State which is situated in the other Contracting State or in a third State shall be deemed for the purposes of the Convention to be a resident only of the sending State if that individual is liable in the sending State to the same obligations in relation to tax on total income as are residents of that sending State. 3. The Convention shall not apply to international organizations, to organs or officials thereof and to persons who are members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or permanent mission of a third State or group of States, being present in a Contracting State and who are not liable in either Contracting State to the same obligations in relation to tax on their total income as are residents thereof. ARTICLE 27 Miscellaneous Rules 1. The provisions of this Convention shall not be construed to restrict in any manner any exemption, allowance, credit or other deduction accorded by the laws of a Contracting State in the determination of the tax imposed by that State. 2. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a Contracting State from imposing a tax on amounts included in the income of a resident of that State with respect to a partnership, trust, company, or other entity in which that resident has an interest. 3. For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, done at Marrakesh on 15 April 1994, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 4 of Article 23 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States. VI. FINAL PROVISIONS ARTICLE 28 Entry Into Force 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other Contracting State, through diplomatic channels, of the completion of the necessary domestic procedures for this Convention to enter into force in New Zealand and in Canada. This Convention shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following the date on which this Convention enters into force, (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April following the date on which this Convention enters into force.

The Convention between the Government of Canada and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, done at Wellington on 13 May 1980 (referred to herein as the “1980 Convention”) shall cease to have effect from the dates on which this Convention becomes effective in accordance with paragraph 1. 3. The 1980 Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph 2. ARTICLE 29 Termination 1. This Convention shall continue in effect indefinitely but either Contracting State may, on or before June 30 of any calendar year after the year of the entry into force, give to the other Contracting State a notice of termination in writing through the diplomatic channels. In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month following that in which the notice of termination is given, (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following that in which the notice of termination is given. (b) in Canada: (i) in respect of tax withheld at the source on amounts paid or credited to non-residents, on or after the first day of the second month following that in which the notice of termination is given, and (ii) in respect of other Canadian tax, for taxation years beginning after the end of that calendar year. 2. This Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph 1, unless the Contracting States agree otherwise.

The taxes to which this Convention shall apply are: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) the income tax; (ii) the corporation tax; (iii) the special income tax for reconstruction; and (iv) the special corporation tax for reconstruction; (hereinafter referred to as �Japanese tax�); and (b) in the case of New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as �New Zealand tax�). 2. This Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, those referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their respective taxation laws, within a reasonable period of time after such changes. Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term �Japan�, when used in a geographical sense, means all the territory of Japan, including its territorial sea, in which the laws relating to Japanese tax are in force, and all the area beyond its territorial sea, including the seabed and subsoil thereof, over which Japan has sovereign rights in accordance with international law and in which the laws relating to Japanese tax are in force; (b) the term �New Zealand� means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the terms �a Contracting State� and �the other Contracting State� mean New Zealand or Japan, as the context requires; (d) the term �tax� means New Zealand tax or Japanese tax, as the context requires; (e) the term �person� includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (f) the term �company� means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (g) the term �enterprise� applies to the carrying on of any business; (h) the terms �enterprise of a Contracting State� and �enterprise of the other Contracting State� mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (i) the term �international traffic� means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (j) the term �national�, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; (k) the term �competent authority� means: (i) in the case of Japan, the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative of the Minister of Finance; and (ii) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; and (l) the term �business� includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character. 2. As regards the application of this Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the laws of that Contracting State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Contracting State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that Contracting State. Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term �resident of a Contracting State� means: (a) in the case of Japan, any person who, under the laws of Japan, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person�s domicile, residence, place of head or main office or any other criterion of a similar nature; and (b) in the case of New Zealand, any person who, under the laws of New Zealand, is liable to tax as a resident of New Zealand. The Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof is also a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention. A person is not a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention if the person is liable to tax in that Contracting State in respect only of income from sources in that Contracting State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the individual�s status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both Contracting States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State with which the individual�s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the Contracting State in which the individual�s centre of vital interests is situated cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either Contracting State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which that person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of this Convention, having regard to the place of its head or main office, its place of effective management and any other relevant factors. In the absence of a mutual agreement by the competent authorities of the Contracting States, the person shall not be considered a resident of either Contracting State for the purposes of its claiming any benefits provided by the Convention, except those provided by Article 25. 4. (a) Where under this Convention any income is relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the laws in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income, is taxed by reference to the amount thereof that is remitted to or received in that other Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall apply only to so much of that income as is taxed in the other Contracting State. (b) Where under this Convention any income is relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the laws in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income, is exempt from tax by virtue of being a temporary resident of that other Contracting State within the meaning of the applicable law of that other Contracting State, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall not apply to the extent that that income is exempt from tax in the other Contracting State. 5.

For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. (a) The duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be determined by aggregating the periods during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by associated enterprises provided that the activities carried on in that Contracting State by an enterprise are connected with the activities carried on in that Contracting State by its associated enterprise.

The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4.

The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other Contracting State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other Contracting State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, a Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State in the circumstances referred to in that paragraph after ten years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits that would be subjected to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in that paragraph, have accrued to that enterprise. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State and is a company that has owned directly or indirectly, for the period of six months ending on the date on which entitlement to the dividends is determined, at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends: (a) is a qualified person by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (c) of paragraph 2 of Article 22; (b) has at least 50 per cent of its voting power in the aggregate owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer companies referred to in subparagraph (a); or (c) is granted benefits with respect to those dividends under paragraph 5 of Article 22. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 5. The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a company which is entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its beneficiaries in computing its taxable income in the Contracting State of which the company is a resident. 6. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the tax laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 8. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other Contracting State, nor subject the company�s undistributed profits to a tax on the company�s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other Contracting State. Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if: (a) the interest is beneficially owned by the Government of that other Contracting State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or the central bank of that other Contracting State or any institution wholly owned by that Government; (b) the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of that other Contracting State with respect to debt-claims guaranteed, insured or indirectly financed by the Government of that other Contracting State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or the central bank of that other Contracting State or any institution wholly owned by that Government; or (c) the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State that is a financial institution that is unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer.

Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph (c) of that paragraph may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if: (a) in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph (a) shall not apply if New�Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds two percent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, �approved issuer levy� includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of signature of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; or (b) it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to an arrangement involving back-to-back loans. 6. The term �interest� as used in this Article means income from debtclaims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor�s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, and all other income that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the tax laws of the Contracting State in which the income arises. Income dealt with in Article 10 shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Convention. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 8. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 9. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term �royalties� as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; (b) the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; (c) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (b); or (d) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

(a) Notwithstanding that a resident of a Contracting State may not be a qualified person, that resident shall be entitled to the benefits granted by the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 11 or Article 13 with respect to an item of income described in those paragraphs or Articles derived from the other Contracting State if: (i) the resident is carrying on business in the firstmentioned Contracting State (other than the business of making or managing investments for the resident�s own account, unless the business is banking, insurance or securities business carried on by a bank, insurance company or securities dealer); (ii) the income derived from that other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, that business; and (iii) that resident satisfies any other specified conditions in those paragraphs or Articles for the obtaining of such benefits. (b) If a resident of a Contracting State derives an item of income from a business carried on by that resident in the other Contracting State or derives an item of income arising in the other Contracting State from a person that has with the resident a relationship described in subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 9, the conditions described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be considered to be satisfied with respect to such item of income only if the business carried on in the first-mentioned Contracting State is substantial in relation to the business carried on in that other Contracting State. Whether such business is substantial for the purpose of this paragraph shall be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.  (c) In determining whether a person is carrying on business in a Contracting State under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the business conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and the business conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person. A person shall be connected to another if one owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the voting power of the company) or another person owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the voting power of the company) in each person. In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons. 5. A resident of a Contracting State that is neither a qualified person nor entitled under paragraph 4 to the benefits granted by the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 11 or Article 13 with respect to an item of income described in those paragraphs or Articles, or is a company that is not entitled to the benefits of paragraph 3 of Article 10 because the company does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of paragraph 3 of Article 10, shall nevertheless be granted such benefits if the competent authority of the other Contracting State determines, in accordance with its domestic law or administrative practice, that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of such resident and the conduct of its operations are considered as not having the obtaining of such benefits as one of the principal purposes. 6. For the purposes of this Article: (a) the term �qualified governmental entity� means the Government of a Contracting State, any political subdivision or local authority thereof, the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand or a person that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof; (b) the term �principal class of shares� means the class or classes of shares of a company which represent a majority of the voting power of the company; (c) the term �recognised stock exchange� means: (i) any stock exchange established by a Financial Instruments Exchange or an approved-type financial instruments firms association under the terms of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (Law No. 25 of 1948) of Japan; (ii) the securities markets (other than the New Zealand Debt Market) operated by the New Zealand Exchange Limited and any other New Zealand securities exchange recognised under the laws of New Zealand; and (iii) any other stock exchange which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to recognise for the purposes of this Article; and (d) the term �pension fund� means any person that: (i) is established under the law of a Contracting State; and (ii) is operated principally to administer or provide pensions, retirement benefits or other similar remuneration or to earn income for the benefit of other pension funds. Article 23 LIMITATION OF RELIEF No relief shall be available under this Convention if it was the main purpose of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of any right or property in respect of which the income is paid or derived to take advantage of the Convention by means of that creation or assignment. Article 24 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Japan regarding the allowance as a credit against Japanese tax of tax payable in any country other than Japan, where a resident of Japan derives income from New�Zealand which may be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the amount of New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income shall be allowed as a credit against the Japanese tax imposed on that resident. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed that part of the Japanese tax which is appropriate to that income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Japanese tax paid under the laws of Japan and consistent with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of New�Zealand from sources in Japan (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. Article 25 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other Contracting State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. The provisions of this paragraph shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other Contracting State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other Contracting State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 9 of Article 11 or paragraph 6 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the firstmentioned Contracting State. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned Contracting State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. 5. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. Article 26 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those Contracting States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if that person�s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 25, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs of this Article. 5. Where, (a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and (b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State, any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either Contracting State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these Contracting States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph. Article 27 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that Contracting State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy. 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other Contracting State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 28 ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION OF TAXES 1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. The term �revenue claim� as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of the taxes covered by Article 2 and in addition, the following taxes imposed by the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) the consumption tax; (ii) the inheritance tax; and (iii) the gift tax; (b) in the case of New Zealand: the goods and services tax. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that Contracting State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Contracting State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Contracting State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other Contracting State that met the conditions allowing that other Contracting State to make a request under this paragraph. 4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that Contracting State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Contracting State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other Contracting State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other Contracting State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned Contracting State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Contracting State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that Contracting State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Contracting State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, acts carried out by a Contracting State in the collection of a revenue claim accepted by that Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4, which, if they were carried out by the other Contracting State, would have the effect of suspending or interrupting the time limits applicable to the revenue claim according to the laws of that other Contracting State, shall have such effect under the laws of that other Contracting State. The first-mentioned Contracting State shall inform the other Contracting State about such acts. 7. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 8. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned Contracting State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be (a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned Contracting State that is enforceable under the laws of that Contracting State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Contracting State, prevent its collection, or (b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned Contracting State in respect of which that Contracting State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other Contracting State of that fact and, at the option of the other Contracting State, the firstmentioned Contracting State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 9. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy; (c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; (d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that Contracting State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. 10. Before assistance is lent under the provisions of this Article, the competent authorities of both Contracting States shall agree upon the mode of application of this Article, including an agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance to each of the Contracting States. In particular, the competent authorities of both Contracting States shall agree on a limit to the number of applications for assistance that a Contracting State may make in a particular year, as well as a minimum monetary threshold for a revenue claim for which assistance is sought, and procedural rules related to the remittance of amounts collected pursuant to the provisions of this Article. Article 29 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 30 HEADINGS The headings of the Articles of this Convention are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of the Convention. Article 31 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. This Convention shall be approved in accordance with the legal procedures of each of the Contracting States and shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of exchange of diplomatic notes indicating such approval. 2. This Convention shall be applicable: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts taxable on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, as regards income for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; and (b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable period beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force. 3. The Convention between New Zealand and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed at Wellington on 30 January, 1963, as amended by the Protocol signed at Wellington on 22 March, 1967 (hereinafter in this Article referred to as �the prior Convention�) shall cease to be applicable from the date upon which this Convention applies in respect of the taxes to which the Convention applies in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article. 4. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it applies in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article. Article 32 TERMINATION This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of the Convention. In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts taxable on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, as regards income for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; and (b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable period beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given.

With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the Convention: If, in any future tax treaty with any other state, New Zealand should provide more favourable treatment of dividends with respect to the relevant conditions, New Zealand shall without undue delay inform Japan and shall enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to providing the same treatment. 8.

With reference to paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention: (a) The competent authorities shall by mutual agreement establish a procedure in order to ensure that an arbitration decision will be implemented within two years from a request for arbitration as referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention unless actions or inaction of a person directly affected by the case presented pursuant to that paragraph hinder the resolution of the case or unless the competent authorities and that person agree otherwise. (b) An arbitration panel shall be established in accordance with the following rules: (i) An arbitration panel shall consist of three arbitrators with expertise or experience in international tax matters. (ii) Each competent authority shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the competent authorities shall appoint the third arbitrator who serves as the chair of the arbitration panel in accordance with the procedures agreed by the competent authorities. (iii) All arbitrators shall not be employees of the tax authorities of the Contracting States, nor have had dealt with the case presented pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 26 of the Convention in any capacity. Unless otherwise agreed by the competent authorities of the Contracting States, the third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting State, nor have had the arbitrator�s usual place of residence in either Contracting State, nor have been employed by either Contracting State.

(d) An arbitration decision shall be treated as follows: (i) An arbitration decision has no formal precedential value. (ii) An arbitration decision shall be final, unless that decision is found to be unenforceable by the courts of one of the Contracting States due to a violation of paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention, of this paragraph or of any procedural rule determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph that may reasonably have affected the decision. If the decision is found to be unenforceable due to the violation, the decision shall be considered not to have been made. (e) Where, at any time after a request for arbitration has been made and before the arbitration panel has delivered a decision to the competent authorities and the person who made the request for arbitration, the competent authorities have solved all the unresolved issues submitted to the arbitration, the case shall be considered as resolved pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 26 of the Convention and no arbitration decision shall be provided. 17.

With reference to Article 28 of the Convention: (a) It is understood that in the case of New Zealand the collection of a revenue claim is subject to Part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or any legislation which replaces those provisions after the date of signature of the Convention. (b) In no case shall the provisions of Article 28 of the Convention be construed so as to allow a Contracting State to request assistance from the other Contracting State in the collection of a revenue claim with respect to which the first-mentioned Contracting State would not be able to provide such assistance under the laws or in the normal course of administrative practices of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the request for such assistance were made to the first-mentioned Contracting State.

Convention between New Zealand and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income 2 New Zealand and Japan, Desiring to conclude a new Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 PERSONS COVERED This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. Article 2 TAXES COVERED 1. The taxes to which this Convention shall apply are: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) the income tax; (ii) the corporation tax; (iii) the special income tax for reconstruction; and (iv) the special corporation tax for reconstruction; 3 (hereinafter referred to as “Japanese tax”); and (b) in the case of New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”). 2. This Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Convention in addition to, or in place of, those referred to in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their respective taxation laws, within a reasonable period of time after such changes. Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term “Japan”, when used in a geographical sense, means all the territory of Japan, including its territorial sea, in which the laws relating to Japanese tax are in force, and all the area beyond its territorial sea, including the seabed and subsoil thereof, over which Japan has sovereign rights in accordance with international law and in which the laws relating to Japanese tax are in force; 4 (b) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean New Zealand or Japan, as the context requires; (d) the term “tax” means New Zealand tax or Japanese tax, as the context requires; (e) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (f) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (g) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business; (h) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (i) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between 5 places in the other Contracting State; (j) the term “national”, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; (k) the term “competent authority” means: (i) in the case of Japan, the Minister of Finance or an authorised representative of the Minister of Finance; and (ii) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; and (l) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character. 2. As regards the application of this Convention at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the laws of that Contracting State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Convention applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Contracting State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that Contracting State. 6 Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means: (a) in the case of Japan, any person who, under the laws of Japan, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person’s domicile, residence, place of head or main office or any other criterion of a similar nature; and (b) in the case of New Zealand, any person who, under the laws of New Zealand, is liable to tax as a resident of New Zealand. The Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof is also a resident of that Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention. A person is not a resident of a Contracting State for the purposes of the Convention if the person is liable to tax in that Contracting State in respect only of income from sources in that Contracting State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the individual’s status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both Contracting States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State with 7 which the individual’s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the Contracting State in which the individual’s centre of vital interests is situated cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either Contracting State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the Contracting State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both Contracting States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which that person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of this Convention, having regard to the place of its head or main office, its place of effective management and any other relevant factors. In the absence of a mutual agreement by the competent authorities of the Contracting States, the person shall not be considered a resident of either Contracting State for the purposes of its claiming any benefits provided by the Convention, except those provided by Article 25. 8 4. (a) Where under this Convention any income is relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the laws in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income, is taxed by reference to the amount thereof that is remitted to or received in that other Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first-mentioned Contracting State shall apply only to so much of that income as is taxed in the other Contracting State. (b) Where under this Convention any income is relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the laws in force in the other Contracting State, an individual, in respect of that income, is exempt from tax by virtue of being a temporary resident of that other Contracting State within the meaning of the applicable law of that other Contracting State, then the relief to be allowed under the Convention in the first- mentioned Contracting State shall not apply to the extent that that income is exempt from tax in the other Contracting State. 5. For the purposes of applying this Convention: (a) an item of income: (i) derived from a Contracting State through an entity that is organised in the other Contracting State; and (ii) treated as the income of the beneficiaries, members or participants of that entity under the tax law of that other Contracting State, 9 shall be eligible for the benefits of the Convention that would be granted if it were directly derived by a beneficiary, member or participant of that entity who is a resident of that other Contracting State, to the extent that such beneficiaries, members or participants are residents of that other Contracting State and satisfy any other conditions specified in the Convention, without regard to whether the income is treated as the income of such beneficiaries, members or participants under the tax law of the first-mentioned Contracting State. (b) an item of income: (i) derived from a Contracting State through an entity that is organised in the other Contracting State; and (ii) treated as the income of that entity under the tax law of that other Contracting State, shall be eligible for the benefits of the Convention that would be granted to a resident of that other Contracting State, without regard to whether the income is treated as the income of the entity under the tax law of the first-mentioned Contracting State, if such entity is a resident of that other Contracting State and satisfies any other conditions specified in the Convention. (c) an item of income: (i) derived from a Contracting State through an entity that 10 is organised in a state other than the Contracting States; and (ii) treated as the income of the beneficiaries, members or participants of that entity under the tax law of the other Contracting State, shall be eligible for the benefits of the Convention that would be granted if it were directly derived by a beneficiary, member or participant of that entity who is a resident of that other Contracting State, to the extent that such beneficiaries, members or participants are residents of that other Contracting State and satisfy any other conditions specified in the Convention, without regard to whether the income is treated as the income of such beneficiaries, members or participants under the tax law of the first-mentioned Contracting State or the state where the entity is organised. (d) an item of income: (i) derived from a Contracting State through an entity that is organised in a state other than the Contracting States; and (ii) treated as the income of that entity under the tax law of the other Contracting State, shall not be eligible for the benefits of the Convention. 11 (e) an item of income: (i) derived from a Contracting State through an entity that is organised in that Contracting State; and (ii) treated as the income of that entity under the tax law of the other Contracting State, shall not be eligible for the benefits of the Convention. Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; and 12 (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts more than twelve months. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, an enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if, for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 90 days in any twelve month period, it carries on activities (including the operation of substantial equipment) in that Contracting State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or the exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that Contracting State. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State: (a) through an individual who is present in that other Contracting State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and more than 50 per cent of the gross revenues attributable to active business activities of the enterprise during this period or periods are derived from the services performed in that other Contracting State through that individual, or (b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects 13 through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other Contracting State, the activities carried on in that other Contracting State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other Contracting State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make the fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. (a) The duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 shall be determined by aggregating the periods during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by associated enterprises provided that the activities carried on in that Contracting State by an enterprise are connected with the activities carried on in that Contracting State by its associated enterprise. (b) The period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities shall be counted only once for the purpose of determining the duration of activities. (c) For the purposes of this Article, an enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if: (i) an enterprise participates directly or indirectly in the 14 management, control or capital of the other enterprise; or (ii) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of the enterprises. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to 15 (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom the provisions of paragraph 9 apply – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise; or (b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise which participates in the management, control or capital of the person, and any of those goods or merchandise are sold to a resident of that Contracting State, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that Contracting State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that Contracting State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 16 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other Contracting State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploration for or the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit, natural resources or standing timber; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 17 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise. 5. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in that other Contracting State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general 18 administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this Article, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 6. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State I s beneficially entitled, whether directly or through one or more interposed trusts, to a share of the profits derived from business carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust (other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes) in its capacity as trustee; and (b) in relation to the carrying on of the business, that trustee, in accordance with the principles stated in Article 5, has a permanent establishment in that other Contracting State, the business carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in that other Contracting State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the share of the profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment. 19 7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 8. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, an enterprise of a Contracting State that derives income from any form of insurance, other than life insurance, in the form of premiums paid for the insurance of risks situated in that other Contracting State, may be taxed on such income in the other Contracting State in accordance with the laws of that other Contracting State which are in force on the date of signature of this Convention, or are substantially similar in general principle to any such provision but are enacted and have effect after the date of signature of the Convention. Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic carried on by an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, provided that no political subdivision or local authority of New Zealand levies a tax similar to the local inhabitant taxes or the enterprise tax in Japan in respect of the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic carried on by an enterprise of Japan, an enterprise of New Zealand shall be exempt from the local inhabitant taxes and the enterprise tax in Japan in respect of the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. 20 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits referred to in that paragraph which are derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the 21 enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other Contracting State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other Contracting State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, a Contracting State shall not change the profits of an enterprise of that Contracting State in the circumstances referred to in that paragraph after ten years from the end of the taxable year in which the profits that would be subjected to such change would, but for the conditions referred to in that paragraph, have accrued to that enterprise. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of fraud or wilful default. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 22 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State and is a company that has owned directly or indirectly, for the period of six months ending on the date on which entitlement to the dividends is determined, at least 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividends and the company that is the beneficial owner of the dividends: (a) is a qualified person by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (c) of paragraph 2 of Article 22; (b) has at least 50 per cent of its voting power in the aggregate owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer companies referred to in subparagraph (a); or (c) is granted benefits with respect to those dividends under paragraph 5 of Article 22. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 23 5. The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not apply in the case of dividends paid by a company which is entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its beneficiaries in computing its taxable income in the Contracting State of which the company is a resident. 6. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the tax laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 8. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other Contracting State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other Contracting State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other Contracting State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other Contracting State. 24 Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest arising in a Contracting State shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if: (a) the interest is beneficially owned by the Government of that other Contracting State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or the central bank of that other Contracting State or any institution wholly owned by that Government; (b) the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of that other Contracting State with respect to debt-claims guaranteed, insured or indirectly financed by the Government of that other Contracting State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, or the central bank of that other Contracting State or any institution wholly owned by that Government; or (c) the interest is beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State that is a financial institution that is 25 unrelated to and dealing wholly independently with the payer. For the purposes of this Article, the term “financial institution” means a bank or other enterprise substantially deriving its profits by raising debt finance in the financial markets or by taking deposits at interest and using those funds in carrying on a business of providing finance. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the terms “the central bank” and “institution wholly owned by that Government” mean: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) the Bank of Japan; (ii) the Japan Bank for International Cooperation; (iii) the Japan International Cooperation Agency; and (iv) the Nippon Export and Investment Insurance; (b) in the case of New Zealand: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; (c) such other similar institution the capital of which is wholly owned by the Government of a Contracting State as may be agreed upon from time to time between the Governments of the Contracting States through an exchange of diplomatic notes. 26 5. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, interest referred to in subparagraph (c) of that paragraph may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest if: (a) in the case of interest arising in New Zealand, it is paid by a person that has not paid approved issuer levy in respect of the interest. This subparagraph (a) shall not apply if New Zealand does not have an approved issuer levy, or the payer of the interest is not eligible to elect to pay the approved issuer levy, or if the rate of the approved issuer levy payable in respect of such interest exceeds two percent of the gross amount of the interest. For the purposes of this Article, “approved issuer levy” includes any identical or substantially similar charge payable by the payer of interest arising in New Zealand enacted after the date of signature of this Convention in place of approved issuer levy; or (b) it is paid as part of an arrangement involving back-to-back loans or other arrangement that is economically equivalent and intended to have a similar effect to an arrangement involving back-to-back loans. 6. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, and all other income that is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from money lent by the tax laws of the 27 Contracting State in which the income arises. Income dealt with in Article 10 shall not be regarded as interest for the purposes of this Convention. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt- claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 8. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 9. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 28 Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that Contracting State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; (b) the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; (c) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (b); or (d) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 29 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to what they are paid for, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 30 Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. Income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or interests in a company, partnership or trust deriving at least 50 per cent of the value of its property directly or indirectly from immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State, unless the relevant class of the shares or the interests is traded on a recognised stock exchange specified in subparagraph (c) of paragraph 6 of Article 22 and the resident and persons related or connected to that resident own in the aggregate 5 per cent or less of that class of the shares or the interests. 3. Where (a) the Government of Japan (including the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan) provides, pursuant to the laws of Japan concerning failure resolution involving imminent insolvency of financial institutions, substantial financial assistance to a financial institution that is a resident of Japan; and (b) a resident of New Zealand acquires shares in the financial institution from the Government of Japan, gains derived by the resident of New Zealand from the alienation of such 31 shares may be taxed in Japan, provided that the alienation is made within five years from the first date on which such financial assistance was provided. 4. Income, profits or gains from the alienation of any property, other than immovable property, forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such income, profits or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 5. Income, profits or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated by that enterprise in international traffic, or any property, other than immovable property, pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. 6. Income, profit or gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. 32 Article 14 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that Contracting State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first- mentioned Contracting State if: (a) the recipient is present in that other Contracting State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of that other Contracting State, and (c) the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment which the employer has in that other Contracting State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State may be taxed in that Contracting State. 33 Article 15 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State. Article 16 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other Contracting State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 34 Article 17 PENSIONS Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 18, pensions and other similar remuneration, including payments under the social security legislation of a Contracting State, paid to a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. Article 18 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Contracting State or political subdivision or local authority shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. (b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that other Contracting State and the individual is a resident of that other Contracting State who: (i) is a national of that other Contracting State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that other Contracting State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds to which 35 contributions are made or created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Contracting State or political subdivision or local authority shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. (b) However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that other Contracting State. 3. The provisions of Articles 14, 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to salaries, wages, pensions, and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. Article 19 STUDENTS Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned Contracting State solely for the purpose of that person’s education or training receives for the purpose of that person’s maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in the first-mentioned Contracting State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside the first-mentioned Contracting State. The exemption provided by this Article shall apply to a business apprentice only for a period not exceeding one year from the date on which the person first begins that person’s training in the first-mentioned Contracting State. 36 Article 20 SILENT PARTNERSHIP Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Convention, any income and gains derived by a silent partner in respect of a silent partnership (Tokumei Kumiai) contract or other similar contract may be taxed in the Contracting State in which such income and gains arise and according to the laws of that Contracting State. Article 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Convention and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other Contracting State. 37 Article 22 LIMITATION ON BENEFITS 1. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of a Contracting State that derives income described in paragraph 3 of Article 11 or Article 13 from the other Contracting State shall be entitled to the benefits granted for a taxable year by the provisions of those paragraphs or Articles only if such resident is a qualified person as defined in paragraph 2 and satisfies any other specified conditions in those paragraphs or Articles for the obtaining of such benefits. 2. A resident of a Contracting State is a qualified person for a taxable year only if such resident is either: (a) an individual; (b) a qualified governmental entity; (c) a company, if its principal class of shares is listed or registered on a recognised stock exchange specified in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (c) of paragraph 6 and is regularly traded on one or more recognised stock exchanges; (d) a pension fund, provided that as of the end of the prior taxable year more than 50 per cent of its beneficiaries, members or participants are individuals who are residents of either Contracting State; (e) an organisation established under the law of that Contracting State and operated exclusively for a religious, charitable, 38 educational, scientific, artistic, cultural or public purposes, provided that all or part of its income may be exempt from tax under the domestic law of that Contracting State; or (f) a person other than an individual, if residents of either Contracting State that are qualified persons by reason of subparagraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this paragraph own, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the voting power or other beneficial interests of the person. 3. Where the provisions of subparagraph (f) of paragraph 2 apply: (a) in respect of taxation by withholding at source, a resident of a Contracting State shall be considered to satisfy the conditions described in that subparagraph for the taxable year in which payment of an item of income is made if such resident satisfies those conditions during the twelve month period preceding the date of the payment; (b) in all other cases, a resident of a Contracting State shall be considered to satisfy the conditions described in that subparagraph for a taxable year if such resident satisfies those conditions on at least half the days of the taxable year. 4. (a) Notwithstanding that a resident of a Contracting State may not be a qualified person, that resident shall be entitled to the benefits granted by the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 11 or Article 13 with respect to an item of income described in those paragraphs or Articles derived from the other Contracting State if: 39 (i) the resident is carrying on business in the first-mentioned Contracting State (other than the business of making or managing investments for the resident’s own account, unless the business is banking, insurance or securities business carried on by a bank, insurance company or securities dealer); (ii) the income derived from that other Contracting State is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, that business; and (iii) that resident satisfies any other specified conditions in those paragraphs or Articles for the obtaining of such benefits. (b) If a resident of a Contracting State derives an item of income from a business carried on by that resident in the other Contracting State or derives an item of income arising in the other Contracting State from a person that has with the resident a relationship described in subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 9, the conditions described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be considered to be satisfied with respect to such item of income only if the business carried on in the first-mentioned Contracting State is substantial in relation to the business carried on in that other Contracting State. Whether such business is substantial for the purpose of this paragraph shall be determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. 40 (c) In determining whether a person is carrying on business in a Contracting State under subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, the business conducted by a partnership in which that person is a partner and the business conducted by persons connected to such person shall be deemed to be conducted by such person. A person shall be connected to another if one owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the voting power of the company) or another person owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interests (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the voting power of the company) in each person. In any case, a person shall be considered to be connected to another if, on the basis of all the facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons. 5. A resident of a Contracting State that is neither a qualified person nor entitled under paragraph 4 to the benefits granted by the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 11 or Article 13 with respect to an item of income described in those paragraphs or Articles, or is a company that is not entitled to the benefits of paragraph 3 of Article 10 because the company does not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (a) or (b) of paragraph 3 of Article 10, shall nevertheless be granted such benefits if the competent authority of the other Contracting State determines, in accordance with its domestic law or administrative practice, that the establishment, acquisition or maintenance of such resident and the conduct of its operations are considered as not having the obtaining of such benefits as one of the principal purposes. 41 6. For the purposes of this Article: (a) the term “qualified governmental entity” means the Government of a Contracting State, any political subdivision or local authority thereof, the Bank of Japan, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand or a person that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof; (b) the term “principal class of shares” means the class or classes of shares of a company which represent a majority of the voting power of the company; (c) the term “recognised stock exchange” means: (i) any stock exchange established by a Financial Instruments Exchange or an approved-type financial instruments firms association under the terms of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (Law No. 25 of 1948) of Japan; (ii) the securities markets (other than the New Zealand Debt Market) operated by the New Zealand Exchange Limited and any other New Zealand securities exchange recognised under the laws of New Zealand; and (iii) any other stock exchange which the competent authorities of the Contracting States agree to recognise for the purposes of this Article; and 42 (d) the term “pension fund” means any person that: (i) is established under the law of a Contracting State; and (ii) is operated principally to administer or provide pensions, retirement benefits or other similar remuneration or to earn income for the benefit of other pension funds. Article 23 LIMITATION OF RELIEF No relief shall be available under this Convention if it was the main purpose of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of any right or property in respect of which the income is paid or derived to take advantage of the Convention by means of that creation or assignment. Article 24 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Japan regarding the allowance as a credit against Japanese tax of tax payable in any country other than Japan, where a resident of Japan derives income from New Zealand which may be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the amount of New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income shall be allowed as a credit against the Japanese tax imposed on that resident. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed that part of the Japanese tax which is appropriate to that income. 43 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Japanese tax paid under the laws of Japan and consistent with this Convention, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Japan (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. Article 25 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other Contracting State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. The provisions of this paragraph shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other Contracting State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other Contracting State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to individuals who are residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs 44 and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 9 of Article 11 or paragraph 6 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purposes of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State. 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned Contracting State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. 5. The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description imposed by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. Article 26 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those 45 Contracting States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if that person’s case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 25, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs of this Article. 5. Where, (a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that 46 the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, and (b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State, any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if the person so requests. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if a decision on these issues has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal of either Contracting State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these Contracting States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph. 47 Article 27 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that Contracting State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; 48 (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy. 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other Contracting State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 28 ASSISTANCE IN THE COLLECTION OF TAXES 1. The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 49 2. The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of the taxes covered by Article 2 and in addition, the following taxes imposed by the Contracting States, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) the consumption tax; (ii) the inheritance tax; and (iii) the gift tax; (b) in the case of New Zealand: the goods and services tax. 3. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that Contracting State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Contracting State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Contracting State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other Contracting State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other Contracting State that met the conditions allowing that other Contracting State to make a request under this paragraph. 50 4. When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that Contracting State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that Contracting State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other Contracting State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other Contracting State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned Contracting State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Contracting State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that Contracting State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that Contracting State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, acts carried out by a Contracting State in the collection of a revenue claim accepted by that Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4, which, if they were carried out by the other Contracting State, would have the effect of suspending or interrupting the time limits applicable to the revenue claim according to the laws of that other Contracting State, shall have such effect under the laws of that other Contracting State. The first-mentioned Contracting State shall inform the other Contracting State about such acts. 51 7. Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State. 8. Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned Contracting State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be (a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned Contracting State that is enforceable under the laws of that Contracting State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that Contracting State, prevent its collection, or (b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned Contracting State in respect of which that Contracting State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection the competent authority of the first-mentioned Contracting State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other Contracting State of that fact and, at the option of the other Contracting State, the first-mentioned Contracting State shall either suspend or withdraw its request. 52 9. In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy; (c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice; (d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that Contracting State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State. 10. Before assistance is lent under the provisions of this Article, the competent authorities of both Contracting States shall agree upon the mode of application of this Article, including an agreement to ensure comparable levels of assistance to each of the Contracting States. In particular, the competent authorities of both Contracting States shall agree on a limit to the number of applications for assistance that a Contracting State may make in a particular year, as well as a minimum monetary threshold for a revenue claim for which assistance is sought, and procedural rules related to the remittance of amounts collected pursuant to the provisions of this Article. 53 Article 29 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Convention shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 30 HEADINGS The headings of the Articles of this Convention are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of the Convention. Article 31 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. This Convention shall be approved in accordance with the legal procedures of each of the Contracting States and shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of exchange of diplomatic notes indicating such approval. 54 2. This Convention shall be applicable: (a) in the case of Japan: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts taxable on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, as regards income for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; and (b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Convention enters into force; and 55 (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable period beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the Convention enters into force. 3. The Convention between New Zealand and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed at Wellington on 30 January, 1963, as amended by the Protocol signed at Wellington on 22 March, 1967 (hereinafter in this Article referred to as “the prior Convention”) shall cease to be applicable from the date upon which this Convention applies in respect of the taxes to which the Convention applies in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article. 4. The prior Convention shall terminate on the last date on which it applies in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article. Article 32 TERMINATION This Convention shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Convention, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year beginning after the expiry of five years from the date of entry into force of the Convention. In such event, the Convention shall cease to have effect: 56 (a) in the case of Japan: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts taxable on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, as regards income for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; and (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; and (b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) with respect to taxes on income withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given; (ii) with respect to taxes on income which are not withheld at source, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; and 57 (iii) with respect to other taxes, as regards taxes for any taxable period beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice is given.

FOR NEW ZEALAND FOR JAPAN 1 Protocol At the signing of the Convention between New Zealand and Japan for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”), New Zealand and Japan have agreed upon the following provisions, which shall form an integral part of the Convention: 1. It is understood that: (a) Except to the extent provided in subparagraph (b), the Convention shall not affect the taxation by a Contracting State of its residents (as determined under Article 4 of the Convention). (b) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not affect the benefits conferred by a Contracting State under the Convention in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 9, and Articles 18, 19, 24, 25, 26 and 29 of the Convention. 2. With reference to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 2 of the Convention: The term “New Zealand tax” or “Japanese tax” shall not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of New Zealand or Japan, respectively, relating to the taxes to which the Convention applies. 2 3. With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Convention: It is understood that the term “any other relevant factors” includes: (a) where the senior day-to-day management is carried on; (b) which Contracting State’s law governs the legal status; (c) where the accounting records are held; and (d) where business is carried on. 4. With reference to paragraph 4 of Article 5 of the Convention: (a) It is understood that an enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be considered to operate equipment in the other Contracting State where the enterprise leases equipment under a lease contract that is solely for the provision of equipment, including a bareboat lease contract. (b) It is understood that the factors of size, quantity or value of equipment or the role of equipment in income producing activities are relevant in determining whether the equipment is substantial on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each particular case. (c) It is understood that the term “substantial equipment” may include oil or drilling rigs, platforms and other structures used in the petroleum or mining industry. 3 5. With reference to subparagraph (a) of paragraph 6 of Article 7 of the Convention: It is understood that in the case of Japan the term "a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes" means a trust, the trustee of which is subject to tax in respect of profits derived from business carried on by the use of trust estate. 6. With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12 of the Convention: It is understood that in determining, for the purposes of those Articles, whether dividends, interest or royalties are beneficially owned by a resident of New Zealand: (a) dividends, interest or royalties arising in Japan in respect of which a trustee who is a resident of New Zealand is subject to tax in New Zealand; or (b) dividends arising in Japan in respect of which a trustee who is a resident of New Zealand would be subject to tax in New Zealand but for an application of an exemption that applies generally to those dividends under the law of New Zealand, shall be treated as being beneficially owned by that trustee. 7. With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the Convention: If, in any future tax treaty with any other state, New Zealand should provide more favourable treatment of dividends with respect to the relevant conditions, New Zealand shall without undue delay inform Japan 4 and shall enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to providing the same treatment. 8. With reference to paragraph 6 of Article 10 of the Convention: It is understood that the term “dividends” includes, in the case of New Zealand, income in relation to profit-related debentures, substituting debentures and stapled debt securities as defined in sections FA 2 and FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 or any substantially similar provision which is enacted and has effect after the date of signature of the Convention. 9. With reference to paragraph 3 and 4 of Article 11 of the Convention: It is understood that the New Zealand Export Credit Office is a part of the Government of New Zealand. 10. With reference to paragraph 5 of Article 11 of the Convention: It is understood that the term “arrangement involving back-to-back loans” would cover, inter alia, any kind of arrangement structured in such a way that a financial institution which is a resident of a Contracting State receives interest arising in the other Contracting State and the financial institution pays an equivalent interest to another person who is a resident of the first-mentioned Contracting State and, if it received the interest directly from the other Contracting State, would not be entitled to the exemption from tax with respect to that interest in that other Contracting State. 5 11. With reference to Article 11 of the Convention: If, in any future tax treaty with any other state, New Zealand should provide more favourable treatment of interest derived by financial institutions, New Zealand shall without undue delay inform Japan and shall enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to providing the same treatment. 12. With reference to Articles 11, 12 and 14 of the Convention: The reference to the term “borne by” is also applicable to interest, royalties or remuneration that is deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment. 13. With reference to subparagraph (d) of paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the Convention: It is understood that the term “forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right” applies to cases where the holder of any property or right receives a payment as consideration for not making such property or right available to another person. 14. With reference to Article 13 of the Convention: It is understood that paragraph 1 of Article 13 of the Convention shall apply to income, profits or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of the interests in a partnership or trust to the extent that the income, profits or gains is treated for the purposes of the taxation laws of the other Contracting State as the income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of immovable property 6 referred to in Article 6 of the Convention situated in that other Contracting State. 15. With reference to Article 25 of the Convention: It is confirmed that the provisions of Article 25 of the Convention shall not affect the provisions of the taxation laws of New Zealand concerning: (a) Subpart FE of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with thin capitalisation; (b) Section CW 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with an inter-corporate dividend exemption for wholly-owned groups; (c) Subpart FM of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with consolidated groups; (d) Section EB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with transfers of trading stock within a wholly-owned group; (e) Subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with loss offsets between group companies; (f) Subpart FO of the Income Tax Act 2007 which deals with amalgamation of companies; and (g) Any provision adopted after the date of signature of the Convention which is substantially similar in purpose or intent to a provision covered by this paragraph, or is otherwise 7 agreed between the Governments of the Contracting States through an exchange of diplomatic notes, provided that any such provision does not allow for different treatment of residents of Japan as compared with the treatment of residents of any third state. 16. With reference to paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention: (a) The competent authorities shall by mutual agreement establish a procedure in order to ensure that an arbitration decision will be implemented within two years from a request for arbitration as referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention unless actions or inaction of a person directly affected by the case presented pursuant to that paragraph hinder the resolution of the case or unless the competent authorities and that person agree otherwise. (b) An arbitration panel shall be established in accordance with the following rules: (i) An arbitration panel shall consist of three arbitrators with expertise or experience in international tax matters. (ii) Each competent authority shall appoint one arbitrator. The two arbitrators appointed by the competent authorities shall appoint the third arbitrator who serves as the chair of the arbitration panel in accordance with the procedures agreed by the competent authorities. 8 (iii) All arbitrators shall not be employees of the tax authorities of the Contracting States, nor have had dealt with the case presented pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 26 of the Convention in any capacity. Unless otherwise agreed by the competent authorities of the Contracting States, the third arbitrator shall not be a national of either Contracting State, nor have had the arbitrator’s usual place of residence in either Contracting State, nor have been employed by either Contracting State. (iv) The competent authorities shall ensure that all arbitrators and their staff agree, in statements sent to each competent authority, prior to their acting in an arbitration proceeding, to abide by and be subject to the same confidentiality and non-disclosure obligations described in paragraph 2 of Article 27 of the Convention and in the applicable domestic laws of the Contracting States. (v) Each competent authority shall bear the cost of its appointed arbitrator and its own expenses. The cost of the chair of an arbitration panel and other expenses associated with the conduct of the proceedings shall be borne by the competent authorities in equal shares. (c) The competent authorities shall provide the information necessary for the arbitration decision to all arbitrators and their staff without undue delay. 9 (d) An arbitration decision shall be treated as follows: (i) An arbitration decision has no formal precedential value. (ii) An arbitration decision shall be final, unless that decision is found to be unenforceable by the courts of one of the Contracting States due to a violation of paragraph 5 of Article 26 of the Convention, of this paragraph or of any procedural rule determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph that may reasonably have affected the decision. If the decision is found to be unenforceable due to the violation, the decision shall be considered not to have been made. (e) Where, at any time after a request for arbitration has been made and before the arbitration panel has delivered a decision to the competent authorities and the person who made the request for arbitration, the competent authorities have solved all the unresolved issues submitted to the arbitration, the case shall be considered as resolved pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 26 of the Convention and no arbitration decision shall be provided. 17. With reference to paragraph 5 of Article 27 of the Convention: It is understood that a Contracting State may decline to supply information relating to confidential communications between attorneys, solicitors or other admitted legal representatives in their role as such and their clients to the extent that the communications are protected from 10 disclosure under the domestic law of that Contracting State. 18. With reference to Article 28 of the Convention: (a) It is understood that in the case of New Zealand the collection of a revenue claim is subject to Part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or any legislation which replaces those provisions after the date of signature of the Convention. (b) In no case shall the provisions of Article 28 of the Convention be construed so as to allow a Contracting State to request assistance from the other Contracting State in the collection of a revenue claim with respect to which the first-mentioned Contracting State would not be able to provide such assistance under the laws or in the normal course of administrative practices of the first-mentioned Contracting State if the request for such assistance were made to the first-mentioned Contracting State. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by their respective Governments, have signed this Protocol.

The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. (2) Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. (3) In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). (4) If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. (5) In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.� Article 2 (1) The Contracting States shall notify each other through diplomatic channels that the constitutional requirements for the entry into force of this Third Protocol have been complied with. (2) The Third Protocol shall enter into force on the date of the later of the notifications referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, and its provisions shall have effect for requests made on or after the date of the entry into force of this Protocol with regard to tax years beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force.     �����  � � � �

The taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are: (a) In New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as �New Zealand tax�); (b) In the Independent State of Papua New Guinea: the income tax imposed under the law of Papua New Guinea, including: (i) the salary or wages tax; (ii) the additional profits tax upon additional profits from resource projects; (iii) the dividend withholding tax upon taxable dividend income; (iv) the foreign contractor withholding tax; (v) the management fee withholding tax; (vi) the business payments tax; and (vii) the interest withholding tax (hereinafter referred to as �Papua New Guinea tax�). 2. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the taxes listed in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term "Papua New Guinea" means the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and, when used in a geographical sense, includes any area adjacent to territorial limits of Papua New Guinea in respect of which there is for the time being in force, consistent with international law, a law of Papua New Guinea dealing with the exploitation of any of the natural resources of the Continental Shelf, its sea bed and sub-soil; (b) the term �New Zealand� means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean Papua New Guinea or New Zealand as the context requires; (d) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (e) the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (f) the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (g) the term "tax" means Papua New Guinea tax or New Zealand tax as the context requires; (h) the term "national" means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of a Contracting State; (ii) any legal person, partnership, association or any other entity deriving its status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State; (i) the term �international traffic� means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (j) the term "competent authority" means: (i) in the case of Papua New Guinea, the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue; and (ii) in the case of New Zealand the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative. 2. For the purposes of Articles 10, 11 and 12, dividends, interest or royalties arising in a Contracting State and derived by or through a trust shall be deemed to be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State where: (a) such income is subject to tax in that other State in the hands of the trustee of that trust; (b) with reference to dividends, the income would be subject to tax in the hands of the trustee of that trust but for an exemption that applies to those dividends under the laws of that other State. 3. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. Article 4 Resident 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �resident of a Contracting State� means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person, being an individual, is a resident of both Contracting States, then the status of that person shall be determined in accordance with the following rules: (a) the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which the person has a permanent home; (b) if a permanent home is available to the person in both States, or in neither of them, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which the person's personal and economic relations are the closer (centre of vital interests); (c) if the Contracting State in which the person's centre of vital interests cannot be determined, and the person has no permanent home in either State, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which the person has an habitual abode; (d) if the person has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which the person is a national; (e) if the person is a national of both Contracting States or is a national of neither Contracting State, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. If the State in which the place of effective management is situated cannot be determined, or the place of effective management is in neither State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement in accordance with Article 23 the Contracting State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its places of management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement. Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �permanent establishment� means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term �permanent establishment� includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources including timber or other forestry products, and (g) a farm or other place where agricultural, forestry, pastoral, plantation or other related activities are carried on. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 90 days. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if for more than 90 days in any 365 day period: (a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including indigenous and exotic timber or other forest products, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if services are furnished in that State, including consultancy services through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purposes, and those activities continue for the same or a connected project within that State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days in any 365 day period. 6. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term �permanent establishment� shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person � other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies � is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) the person has no authority, but habitually maintains in the first-mentioned State a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise from which that person regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the enterprise; or (c) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 8. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, and conditions are made or imposed between that enterprise and the agent in their commercial and financial relations which differ from those which would have been made between independent enterprises, the agent will not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph. 9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term �immovable property� shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources (including mineral deposits, oil or gas deposits or quarries) or indigenous or exotic timber or other forest products, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources (including mineral deposits, oil or gas deposits or quarries) or indigenous or exotic timber or other forest products; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3.

The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Any interest or right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place.Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to: (a) that permanent establishment; or (b) sales within that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that the law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, consistent with the principles of this Article. 6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 7. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident�s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 9. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 10. Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of the law of Papua New Guinea relating to the taxation of income derived by a foreign contractor from a prescribed contract, where, in accordance with this Agreement, that contractor is a resident of New Zealand with a permanent establishment in Papua New Guinea, provided that if the relevant law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (other than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate. Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. 4. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall include: (a) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and (b) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers), used for the transport of goods or merchandise; where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. 5. The term �operation of ships or aircraft� shall mean the business of transportation by sea or air of passengers, mail, livestock or goods carried on by the owners or lessees or charterers of ships or aircraft. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistent with the principles of this Article. 3. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares and other income treated as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company�s undistributed profits to a tax on the company�s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 the Government of a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State in respect of interest derived by the Government from the other State. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the term �Government�: (a) in the case of Papua New Guinea, means the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and shall include: (i) the Bank of Papua New Guinea; (ii) the Provincial Governments; (iii) the Local Level Governments, and (iv)� any institution carrying on functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; (b) in the case of New Zealand, means the Government of New Zealand and shall include: (i) the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; (ii) local authorities, and (iii) any institution carrying on functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 5. The term �interest� as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor�s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with: (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base; or (b) business activities referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 9. The provisions of this Article shall not apply if the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article. Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term �royalties� as used in this Article means payments or credits of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right; (b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; (c) the supply of knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c); (e) the use of, or the right to use: (i) cinematograph or motion picture films; or (ii) films or video tapes in connection with television; or (iii) tapes or compact disks in connection with radio and television broadcasting; or (f) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with: (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base; or (b) business activities referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 7. In this Article, a reference to royalties paid or to the payment of royalties includes royalties credited or the crediting of royalties. Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1.

Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person�s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3.

Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Papua New Guinea tax paid under the laws of Papua New Guinea and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Papua New Guinea (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purpose of paragraphs 2, Papua New Guinea tax paid shall include an amount equivalent to the amount of any Papua New Guinea tax forgone. 4. In paragraph 3, the term "Papua New Guinea tax forgone" means an amount which, under the law of Papua New Guinea relating to Papua New Guinea tax and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Papua New Guinea tax on income but for an exemption from, or a reduction of, Papua New Guinea tax on that income resulting from the operation of those provisions of the laws of Papua New Guinea which the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea agree from time to time in letters exchanged for this purpose to be provisions to which this paragraph applies. Subject to its terms, such an agreement on applicable provisions shall be valid for as long as those provisions are not modified after the date of that agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character. 5. Paragraph 3 and 4 shall apply only in relation to those years of income that may be agreed by the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea in letters exchanged for this purpose. 6.

The provision of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall only apply for a period of 10 years commencing on the date of which the Agreement enters into force.CHAPTER V SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 23 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2.

Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4.

The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 25 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 26 ENTRY INTO FORCE Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (b) in Papua New Guinea: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the later of these notifications is given; (ii) in respect of any other Papua New Guinea tax, in relation to income of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the later of these notifications is given. Article 27 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION WITH RESPECT TO TAXES ON INCOME The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, Desiring to conclude an Agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: 1 CHAPTER I SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT Article 1 PERSONS COVERED This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2 Article 2 TAXES COVERED 1. The taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are: (a) In New Zealand: the income tax (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”); (b) In the Independent State of Papua New Guinea: the income tax imposed under the law of Papua New Guinea, including: (i) the salary or wages tax; (ii) the additional profits tax upon additional profits from resource projects; (iii) the dividend withholding tax upon taxable dividend income; (iv) the foreign contractor withholding tax; (v) the management fee withholding tax; (vi) the business payments tax; and (vii) the interest withholding tax (hereinafter referred to as “Papua New Guinea tax”). 2. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the taxes listed in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. 3 CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS Article 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term "Papua New Guinea" means the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and, when used in a geographical sense, includes any area adjacent to territorial limits of Papua New Guinea in respect of which there is for the time being in force, consistent with international law, a law of Papua New Guinea dealing with the exploitation of any of the natural resources of the Continental Shelf, its sea bed and sub-soil; (b) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; (c) the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean Papua New Guinea or New Zealand as the context requires; (d) the term "person" includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (e) the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (f) the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (g) the term "tax" means Papua New Guinea tax or New Zealand tax as the context requires; (h) the term "national" means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of a Contracting State; 4 (ii) any legal person, partnership, association or any other entity deriving its status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State; (i) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (j) the term "competent authority" means: (i) in the case of Papua New Guinea, the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue or an authorised representative of the Commissioner General of Internal Revenue; and (ii) in the case of New Zealand the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative. 2. For the purposes of Articles 10, 11 and 12, dividends, interest or royalties arising in a Contracting State and derived by or through a trust shall be deemed to be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State where: (a) such income is subject to tax in that other State in the hands of the trustee of that trust; (b) with reference to dividends, the income would be subject to tax in the hands of the trustee of that trust but for an exemption that applies to those dividends under the laws of that other State. 3. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. 5 Article 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person, being an individual, is a resident of both Contracting States, then the status of that person shall be determined in accordance with the following rules: (a) the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which the person has a permanent home; (b) if a permanent home is available to the person in both States, or in neither of them, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which the person's personal and economic relations are the closer (centre of vital interests); (c) if the Contracting State in which the person's centre of vital interests cannot be determined, and the person has no permanent home in either State, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which the person has an habitual abode; (d) if the person has an habitual abode in both Contracting States or in neither of them, the person shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which the person is a national; (e) if the person is a national of both Contracting States or is a national of neither Contracting State, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is situated. If the State in which the place of effective management is situated cannot be determined, or 6 the place of effective management is in neither State, then the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement in accordance with Article 23 the Contracting State of which the person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its places of management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement. 7 Article 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources including timber or other forestry products, and (g) a farm or other place where agricultural, forestry, pastoral, plantation or other related activities are carried on. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 90 days. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if for more than 90 days in any 365 day period: (a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including indigenous and exotic timber or other forest products, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in one of the Contracting States and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if 8 services are furnished in that State, including consultancy services through employees or other personnel engaged by the enterprise for such purposes, and those activities continue for the same or a connected project within that State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days in any 365 day period. 6. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) the person has no authority, but habitually maintains in the first- mentioned State a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the 9 enterprise from which that person regularly delivers goods or merchandise on behalf of the enterprise; or (c) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 6 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 8. An enterprise of a Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that other State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise, and conditions are made or imposed between that enterprise and the agent in their commercial and financial relations which differ from those which would have been made between independent enterprises, the agent will not be considered an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph. 9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. 10 CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources (including mineral deposits, oil or gas deposits or quarries) or indigenous or exotic timber or other forest products, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources (including mineral deposits, oil or gas deposits or quarries) or indigenous or exotic timber or other forest products; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. 5. Any interest or right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to: (a) that permanent establishment; or (b) sales within that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 1 4. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 5. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment, provided that the law shall be applied, so far as the information available to the competent authority permits, consistent with the principles of this Article. 6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 7. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident’s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 2 9. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 10. Nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of the law of Papua New Guinea relating to the taxation of income derived by a foreign contractor from a prescribed contract, where, in accordance with this Agreement, that contractor is a resident of New Zealand with a permanent establishment in Papua New Guinea, provided that if the relevant law in force in either Contracting State at the date of signature of this Agreement is varied (other than in minor respects so as not to affect its general character) the Contracting States shall consult with each other with a view to agreeing to any amendment of this paragraph that may be appropriate. 3 Article 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. 4. For the purposes of this Article, profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall include: (a) profits from the rental on a bareboat basis of ships or aircraft; and (b) profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers), used for the transport of goods or merchandise; where such rental or such use, maintenance or rental, as the case may be, is incidental to the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. 5. The term “operation of ships or aircraft” shall mean the business of transportation by sea or air of passengers, mail, livestock or goods carried on by the owners or lessees or charterers of ships or aircraft. 4 Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Nothing in this Article shall affect the application of any law of a Contracting State relating to the determination of the tax liability of a person, including determinations in cases where the information available to the competent authority of that State is inadequate to determine the income to be attributed to an enterprise, provided that that law shall be applied, so far as it is practicable to do so, consistent with the principles of this Article. 3. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares and other income treated as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 1 Article 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 the Government of a Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State in respect of interest derived by the Government from the other State. 4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the term “Government”: (a) in the case of Papua New Guinea, means the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea and shall include: (i) the Bank of Papua New Guinea; (ii) the Provincial Governments; (iii) the Local Level Governments, and (iv) any institution carrying on functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; (b) in the case of New Zealand, means the Government of New Zealand and shall include: (i) the Reserve Bank of New Zealand; (ii) local authorities, and (iii) any institution carrying on functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 5. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to 2 participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with: (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base; or (b) business activities referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last- mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 3 9. The provisions of this Article shall not apply if the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid was created or assigned mainly for the purpose of taking advantage of this Article. 4 Article 12 ROYALTIES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments or credits of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right; (b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; (c) the supply of knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (d) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c); (e) the use of, or the right to use: (i) cinematograph or motion picture films; or (ii) films or video tapes in connection with television; or (iii) tapes or compact disks in connection with radio and television broadcasting; or (f) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 5 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with: (a) such permanent establishment or fixed base; or (b) business activities referred to in sub-paragraph 1(b) of Article 7. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State where the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are borne by or deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment or fixed base then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 7. In this Article, a reference to royalties paid or to the payment of royalties includes royalties credited or the crediting of royalties. 6 Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or together with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State in international traffic and movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in the State of which the enterprise is a resident. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of one of the Contracting States from the alienation of shares or comparable interests in a company, the assets of which consist directly or indirectly wholly or principally of immovable property in the other Contracting State of a kind referred to in Article 6 and, as provided in that Article, situated in that other State, may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. 7 Article 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless such services are performed in the other Contracting State and: (a) a fixed base is regularly available to the individual in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing the individual's activities; or (b) income is derived by the individual from a resident of that other Contracting State and exceeds an amount of US$10,000 or its equivalent in Papua New Guinea Kina in any 365 day period; or (c) the individual is present in the other State for the purpose of performing those services or activities for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 365 day period commencing or ending in the year of the income concerned. If the provisions of subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) are satisfied, the income may be taxed in that other State but only so much of it as is attributable to activities performed during such period or periods or from that fixed base. 2. The term "professional services" includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. 8 Article 15 DEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18 and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 365 day period commencing or ending in the income year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and (c) the remuneration is neither borne by nor deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 9 Article 16 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 10 Article 17 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7, 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, income derived by entertainers or sportspersons who are residents of a Contracting State from the activities exercised in the other Contracting State under a special programme of cultural exchange agreed upon between the governments of both Contracting States, shall be exempt from tax in that other State. 11 Article 18 PENSIONS 1. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration for past employment or any life annuity arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 2. The term "annuity" includes a stated sum payable periodically at stated times, during life or during a specified or ascertainable period of time, under an obligation to make the payments in return for adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. 3. Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 12 Article 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than a pension) paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority to any individual in respect of services rendered to that State or political subdivision or local authority shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such salaries, wages or other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that other State and the individual is a resident of that other State who: (i) is a national of that other State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that other State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 15, 16 and 17 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with any trade or business carried on by a Contracting State, a political subdivision or a local authority. 13 Article 20 STUDENTS AND TRAINEES Payments which a student or business trainee or apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. 14 Article 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. 15 CHAPTER IV ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Article 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Papua New Guinea from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Papua New Guinea tax of tax paid in a country outside Papua New Guinea, New Zealand tax payable under the laws of New Zealand and in accordance with this Agreement, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a person who is a resident of Papua New Guinea for the purposes of the law of Papua New Guinea relating to Papua New Guinea tax from sources in New Zealand (not including, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against Papua New Guinea tax payable in respect of that income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Papua New Guinea tax paid under the laws of Papua New Guinea and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Papua New Guinea (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purpose of paragraphs 2, Papua New Guinea tax paid shall include an amount equivalent to the amount of any Papua New Guinea tax forgone. 4. In paragraph 3, the term "Papua New Guinea tax forgone" means an amount which, under the law of Papua New Guinea relating to Papua New Guinea tax and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Papua New Guinea tax on income but for an exemption from, or a reduction of, Papua New Guinea tax on that income resulting from the operation of those provisions of the laws of Papua New 16 Guinea which the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea agree from time to time in letters exchanged for this purpose to be provisions to which this paragraph applies. Subject to its terms, such an agreement on applicable provisions shall be valid for as long as those provisions are not modified after the date of that agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character. 5. Paragraph 3 and 4 shall apply only in relation to those years of income that may be agreed by the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea in letters exchanged for this purpose. 6. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, 4 and 5, a New Zealand resident deriving income from Papua New Guinea, being income referred to in those paragraphs, shall not be deemed to have paid Papua New Guinea tax in respect of such income where: (a) the New Zealand resident is a financial institution or is associated with a financial institution; (b) the competent authority of New Zealand considers, after consultation with the competent authority of Papua New Guinea, that it is inappropriate to do so having regard to: (i) whether any prearrangements have been entered into by any person for the purpose of taking advantage of paragraph 3 for the benefit of that person or any other person; (ii) whether any benefit accrues or may accrue to a person who is neither a New Zealand resident nor a Papua New Guinea resident; (iii) the prevention of fraud or the avoidance of the taxes to which this Agreement applies; (iv) any other matter which either competent authority considers relevant in the particular circumstances of the case, including any submissions from the New Zealand resident concerned. 7. The provision of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall only apply for a period of 10 years commencing on the date of which the Agreement enters into force. CHAPTER V SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 23 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the claim appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. 1 Article 24 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 2 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. 3 Article 25 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 4 CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 26 ENTRY INTO FORCE Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (b) in Papua New Guinea: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the later of these notifications is given; (ii) in respect of any other Papua New Guinea tax, in relation to income of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the later of these notifications is given. 5 Article 27 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force.

As a result, the Government has included a review of employee allowances in its tax policy work programme. This issues paper provides officials’ initial thinking in this area. 1.2 Although the term “allowance” is commonly used to refer to non-salary or wage cash payments for employees, the review covers a range of payments made by employers to employees, or made on their employees’ behalf. There is a spectrum of such payments ranging from payments that reimburse an employee’s private expenditure, to payments that are no more than the direct reimbursement of business expenditure incurred for the employer by the employee. In this issues paper we use the term “employee expenditure payment” to refer to all these payments. 1.3 In some cases the generality of the legislation determining the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments can lead to impractical outcomes that may differ from how businesses are applying the rules in practice. We are also aware that in some cases there is a difference between how employers treat employee expenditure payments in practice and Inland Revenue’s view of how the legislation operates. Gaps that arise from the general rules may therefore need to be filled with either more detailed legislation or published statements from Inland Revenue. 1.4 Initial discussions with employers and representative groups suggest that the employee expenditure payment rules work well for employers for the most part, but there are some significant interpretive issues that require a policy response. 1.5 Key types of payment requiring some attention are:  Meal payments – a number of scenarios involving a payment being made to meet the cost of a meal in work-related circumstances and the question of how the payment should be taxed are considered.  Accommodation payments – situations involving both an employee expenditure payment and the provision of accommodation by the employer when taxing less than the full value of the payment are considered.  Communication and clothing payments – issues in relation to communication and work clothing payments when it is often difficult to make an apportionment are considered. 1.6 The paper considers these employee expenditure payments and sets out possible options for how to treat these. Later the paper considers the current legislation and how well it works in providing certainty for other employee expenditure payments more generally. 2 1.7 A boundary between payments that meet a private expense (defined in chapter 2) and those that do not is considered. Payments for a private expense can be seen as a salary substitute. In these circumstances, our starting point is that salary/wages and salary/wage substitutes should be taxed equally. All payments that are salary or wage substitutes should be taxed since all salary and wages are taxed. 1.8 However, to reduce compliance and administrative costs, some payments to meet a private expense should be treated as non-taxable when they are:  low in value and incidental to the work element;  low in value and hard to measure; and  there is little risk of re-characterisation of salary and wages as non-taxable payments. 1.9 Finally, in establishing the taxable amount, valuation is a key concern, including taking into account any employee contribution which reduces the value of any private benefit. 1.10 A summary of the suggested approach and options is set out below and a comparison with the current treatment is provided in the table at Appendix A. Summary of suggested approach and options Meals  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet an employee’s meal expenses during work travel away from the employee’s normal workplace should be exempt from tax, subject to a three-month upper time limit at a particular work location.  Employee expenditure payments to meet the cost of an employee’s working lunches and other working meals/refreshments outside of work travel should not be taxed, provided any payment is not made regularly as an additional payment for the employee’s services. Accommodation  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet an employee’s accommodation expenses during work travel away from the employee’s normal workplace should be exempt from tax, subject to a 12-month upper time limit at a particular work location, with a power for the Commissioner to extend that time limit in certain exceptional circumstances.  When an employee is provided with accommodation by their employer at or near their normal workplace, the value of the accommodation should be taxable to the employee based on the market rental value of the property, after taking into account any employee contribution to the cost of the accommodation. 3  When an employee has more than one permanent workplace for the same job, one option is not to tax employee expenditure payments to cover accommodation costs at one workplace.  A valuation method other than market rental value may be needed to establish the taxable amount when the accommodation is in an overseas location – for example, a valuation by reference to comparable New Zealand accommodation. Communications  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet internet and other electronic communication costs should be taxed in full when meeting mixed work-related and private expenses and there is no separately identifiable work or private element. Clothing  We consider that employee expenditure payments to meet clothing costs should be taxed in full except when they relate to uniform, protective or specialist clothing required for the employee’s job. General legislative issues  Alternative approaches to the current general legislation around the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments are considered, ranging from a fundamental change in approach to leaving the general rules unchanged but introducing a power to exempt particular payments by Commissioner determination – making power for the treatment of payments not addressed by specific rules.  Changes may be needed to the legislation concerning “expenditure on account of an employee” to remove ambiguities around the application of the general exclusions. Next steps 1.11 Once the consultation period has closed, officials will report to Government to consider whether any legislative changes are appropriate. 1.12 All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 except when otherwise stated. 4 How to make a submission 1.13 You are invited to make a submission on the proposed reforms and points raised in this issues paper.

These included the need to improve the integrity of the tax system and social assistance programmes so that individuals pay their fair share of tax, and social assistance is targeted at those in genuine need. The paper is one of a series of papers over the past two years that focus on these themes and objectives, the others being: Social assistance integrity; defining family income and Recognising salary trade-offs as income. It also builds on analysis undertaken in the 2007 issues paper, Tax-free relocation payments and overtime meal allowances. 2.2 The key focus has been on the taxation of labour income and the recognition of this income and other benefits provided by employers to their employees in exchange for labour services when determining eligibility for social assistance, in as comprehensive a way as practicalities allow. 2.3 This paper does not, however, identify or seek to address any major gaps in the tax base that are giving rise to revenue risks. Rather, it assumes that the main challenge for taxing employee expenditure payments is to provide greater certainty for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. 6 2.4 Inland Revenue does not hold detailed information about how much employers pay by way of employee expenditure payments. The observations in this issues paper are, therefore, of necessity based on our discussions with individual businesses and key business representatives that have a range of employers making employee expenditure payments. 2.5 Discussions with employers and representative groups suggest that the employee expenditure payment rules work well for employers for the most part, but there are some significant interpretive issues that mean a policy response is needed. This paper attempts to address these concerns. Development of employee expenditure payments and their tax treatment 2.6 Over the years there have been a number of changes to the tax legislation applying to employee expenditure payments. Their purpose has been to ensure that any payment for private expenditure is taxed, or are a consequence of changes to other taxing provisions applying to employees. 2.7 A key change was the introduction of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules in 1985, which make a clear distinction between monetary payments, that should be taxable to the employee under the income tax rules, and non-cash goods and services that should be taxable to the employer under FBT. The reform included the repeal of the employee deduction rules 1 and introduced the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee”. 2.8 Before 1995, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could determine whether and to what extent any employee expenditure payment constituted a reimbursement of expenditure incurred by the employee in gaining or producing his or her assessable income. The payment was, to the extent determined, exempt from tax. 2 2.9 Dealing with these requests was, however, a resource-intensive process. The approach also did not fit easily with the move to self-assessment. As a result, the approach was changed through legislation in 1995. 3 Since then, it has been the employer’s responsibility to make a judgement on what the correct tax treatment is for an employee expenditure payment. 2.10 The general exemption provision for employee expenditure payments was also changed in 1995. The Commissioner discretion was replaced with a test that makes the expenditure or payment by the employer non-taxable to the extent it relates to expenditure for which the employee would be allowed a deduction but for the employment limitation. These changes meant that certain employee expenditure payments were taxable to the extent that the expenditure they met were private (or domestic) or capital in nature. Rules were also introduced so employers could use a reasonable estimate when determining the expenditure that an employee would be likely to incur. 1 Previously in the fourth schedule of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2 Sections 73(2) and 73A of the Income Tax Act 1976 and then sections CB 12(1) and CB 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 3 Changes were made through the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment (No 2) Act 1995. 7 2.11 A more detailed summary of the current legislation relating to employee expenditure payments can be found in Appendix B. Employee expenditure payments in practice 2.12 As a general observation, in recent times Inland Revenue and employers have been looking to simplify and reduce their processing costs, aided by computerisation and new technologies. Historical work practices have been brought up to date and employment practices changed. Nevertheless, employee expenditure payments must still be inputted into the payroll before they can be paid, which gives rise to significant compliance costs. 2.13 There has also been a change in the shape of New Zealand industry 4 over the past 20 years, with a shift towards service industries and away from more traditional forms of employment such as manufacturing. Service industries have experienced the highest levels of employment growth (particularly business and financial services), stimulated in part by technological change. 2.14 As a result of these changes and business pressures, anecdotal evidence shows that there has generally been a significant reduction in the number, nature and variety of employee expenditure payments over the years. Employers have also tried to reduce business costs by making employee expenditure payments simpler. For example, by paying an allowance to meet estimated business travel expenses rather than reimbursing exact expenses or by providing employees with a corporate credit card to pay for business expenses up-front that can then be settled by the employer. 2.15 Working conditions have also changed, with flexible working arrangements, new communication technologies and computerisation leading to an increase in working outside the traditional office environment. Employees may receive payments to reimburse the additional costs. Employee expenditure payments 2.16 The term “employee expenditure payment” describes a range of payments to reimburse or otherwise meet an employee’s expenditure. 2.17 It includes the payment of a cash allowance. In this context, allowances describe a payment to an employee which is in addition to salary and wages, as compensation for expenditure that the employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. An allowance can be paid in advance of the employee incurring the expenditure and may be based on a reasonable estimate of the expenditure that the employee is likely to incur. 4 Department of Labour. Workforce 2010 – a document to inform public debate on the future of the labour market in New Zealand: Department of Labour, March 2001. 8 2.18 An employee expenditure payment also includes a payment to reimburse actual expenditure incurred by the employee or expenditure on account of an employee to settle the employee’s liability with a third party. The expenditure may be directly related to the employee’s job or may be related to the employer’s business. These sorts of payments are normally paid in arrears either directly to the employee or to a third party to settle the employee’s liability. 2.19 Types of employee expenditure payments that are commonly made and specifically addressed in this document include meals, accommodation, communication and clothing payments. 2.20 Under the current legislation, when an employee expenditure payment is made, provided it is to meet an expense incurred in earning the employee’s employment income, it is not taxable unless there is a private or capital element in the expenditure. In the latter circumstances, the payment may be taxable in part or in full. Payments that are outside the scope of the review 2.21 Employers may also pay allowances relating to unusual conditions of service. These types of allowances do not relate to the employee incurring expenditure. They might, for example, include allowances to recognise additional skills an employee has to offer their employer in carrying out their employment duties. 2.22 Other examples of these sorts of allowances are payments to compensate for difficult or unpleasant working conditions or for taking on additional responsibilities. 2.23 These sorts of payments are likely to be additional rewards for an employee providing their labour in specific circumstances, reflecting market conditions and the need to pay more in order to get the right person to do the job. As such, they are treated as employment income in the same way as wages or salary. These types of allowance normally present few difficulties in determining the correct tax treatment and are not discussed further in this paper. 5 2.24 There are a number of other scenarios, when employers make payments to meet additional expenses arising in connection with the employee’s job, which are not covered by this review. These include overtime meal allowances, additional sustenance allowances, additional transport costs and certain expenses as part of a work-related relocation package. These payments are already subject to existing tax exemptions 6 and are not discussed further in this paper. 5 The tax treatment of an additional skills allowance is wholly separate to any consideration of the tax treatment of any payment by the employer to reimburse an employee for costs they have incurred in gaining the particular skills. 6 Sections CW 17B, 17C and CW 18. 9 Policy questions 2.25 In determining the appropriate tax treatment for a particular employee expenditure payment, our starting point is that the best approach is to consider all such payments, regardless of the nature of the underlying expenses they are intended to meet. Our preference is, therefore, to include all employee expenditure payments whether they are related specifically to the employee’s job or more broadly to the employer’s business. Otherwise, there would be boundary issues around what is included and what is excluded. 2.26 To resolve potential areas of uncertainty around borderline issues, our preference is to have clear objective tests to determine what is taxable and what is not for the most common types of payments. For other types of payments not covered by these specific tests, the general approach outlined in this issues paper in chapter 6 would apply (subject to any options for change). 2.27 In considering the appropriate tax treatment for a particular employee expenditure payment, the first question is whether it covers a private expense. Unless it covers a private expense, there will usually be no taxable element. An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society or is an ordinary living expense. Examples of expenditure that are often of a private nature include food, clothing and accommodation. 2.28 References in this paper to a private expense include the private element of an expense. However, when the private element is low in value and solely incidental to a work expense or low in value and hard to measure it may be preferable, in order to reduce compliance and administrative costs, to ignore it. 2.29 Salary substitution can arise in a range of instances, although it is more evident when an amount of salary has been traded off or given up for non-cash benefits. By contrast, with the exception of accommodation payments, the employee expenditure payments being considered in this issues paper are unlikely, for the most part, to form part of a salary substitution. However, it will be important to ensure that any changes do not introduce any new incentives for salary substitution. 2.30 When goods or services that are low in value and hard to measure are provided to an employee and fall below a minimum threshold, they are often exempt from fringe benefit tax (FBT). 7 This is for compliance and administrative costs reasons. However, exempting equivalent cash payments in this way would pose a fiscal risk. Therefore, while it would not be practical to tax all low in value and hard to value employee expenditure payments, a different approach is needed. 2.31 Account should also be taken of anything the employee contributes, such as an employee contribution to accommodation costs, which reduces the value they receive from their employer. 7 Sections CX 37 and RD 45. 10 2.32 Pragmatic solutions to the main employee expenditure payments that balance the broad salary substitution concerns against the need for workable tax outcomes are considered in this paper. The approach we have taken is illustrated in the flowchart at the end of this chapter. Other considerations 2.33 There are a number of other considerations that have been taken into account in developing the best options for reform. These are:  The tax outcome should not be unduly influenced by the payment mechanism – While an employer will often pay an allowance in anticipation of an employee incurring expenditure, they might also reimburse actual expenditure that has already been incurred or settle an employee’s bill. Alternatively, rather than paying cash they might arrange for goods or services to be provided. Whichever mechanism is chosen, as far as possible, the tax outcome should be the same, without significantly different compliance costs for employers. Rules should be easy to understand and apply – Certainty and simplicity are desirable because employee expenditure payments are mostly dealt with by human resource and payroll staff in larger companies and the wages clerk in smaller companies, who may have little tax expertise. Employers are also reluctant to make judgements about, or delve into, their employees’ personal affairs in determining whether a particular payment is taxable. However, there is a trade-off between providing certainty (with, for example, an objective “bright line” test to determine what is taxable and what is not), against fairness and flexibility with a more subjective test (for example, by reference to what is reasonable).  The impact of any changes to the current rules on employer/ employee agreements and the time needed to adapt these – Many payments are the subject of historical employment agreements negotiated between employers, employees and their trade unions. These agreements may take time to change and, therefore, transitional issues might need to be considered in implementing any changes that arise as an outcome of this review.  The outcome of the review should be revenue-neutral –While the outcome of the review is not intended to raise revenue, it must be recognised that there is limited scope for relaxing the current legislation. 11 Policy principles for reviewing employee expenditure payments Note: The terms used in this flowchart are generic and are not based on current legislation or case law definitions. The flowchart reflects the general policy principles, which should apply so that an employee expenditure payment should not be taxed in the hands of the employee, provided any private expense is low in value and incidental to any work expense or hard to measure and not a salary substitute. These principles are likely to be relevant to all types of employee expenditure payment, although initially focused on the main types identified in this paper. \*“Employee expenditure payment” covers all payments, whether related to the employee’s job or more broadly to the employer’s business, and includes allowances to cover future estimated expenditure, actual reimbursement and expenditure on account of an employee payments. Is this an employee expenditure payment?\* Is the employee expenditure payment to meet a private expense of the employee? Is the private element of the expense solely low in value and incidental to a work expense? Is the private element of the expense low in value, hard to measure and not a salary substitute? FBT or other rules apply to determine the tax treatment. Payment is not taxable. Payment is not taxable. Yes Yes No Yes No No Payment is not taxable. Yes Payment is taxable. No 12 CHAPTER 3 Meal payments Meal payments – suggested approach  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet an employee’s meal expenses during work travel away from the employee’s normal workplace should be exempt from tax, subject to a three-month upper time limit at a particular work location.  Employee expenditure payments to meet the cost of an employee’s working lunches and other working meals/ refreshments outside of work travel should not be taxed, provided any payment is not made regularly as an additional payment for the employee’s services. 3.1 Our general proposition is that when an employer makes a payment to meet an employee expense, the payment should not be taxable to the employee unless it is also to meet the employee’s private expense. Then, the private element of the employee expenditure payment should be taxed. 3.2 However, difficulties can arise in determining whether a particular payment is to meet a private expense. This chapter considers this issue, with particular reference to payments for meal expenses and how the boundary should be drawn between work expenses and private expenses. The general approach 3.3 Businesses usually seek to maximise profits and minimise costs. They do not usually make a payment to or for the benefit of an employee that is not for a business purpose. Similar issues arise, whatever the employer’s business, and when public or not-for-profit sector employers make such payments they will also be conscious of the need to minimise costs. Therefore, when an employer incurs an expense it is likely to be a work expense. 3.4 When an employer makes a payment that is a work expense in its hands, to or for the benefit of an employee, it does not determine the nature of the payment in the employee’s hands. For example, a non-cash benefit will almost always be deductible by the employer as a work expense, but may be of private benefit to the employee (and subject to FBT). Salary and wages can likewise be characterised as a private benefit. The New Zealand courts have stressed that whether a receipt is income depends on its quality in the hands of the recipient (for example, Reid v CIR which concerned the tax treatment of a student teacher allowance). 8 8 Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176. 13 3.5 We therefore need to consider the nature of the underlying expense from the employee’s perspective to determine whether it (or any part of it) is a private expense of the employee and, if so, then determine the tax treatment of the employee expenditure payment. 3.6 What do we mean by a private expense? There is no statutory definition to draw on, but the courts have considered the meaning of “private or domestic expenditure”. In CIR v Haenga 9 (which considered whether payments to a welfare fund were of a private or domestic nature) , Richardson J in the Court of Appeal commented: “An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit ...” 3.7 The case, therefore, tells us that a private outgoing relates to an individual living as a member of society – for example, food and drink. A domestic expense is one that relates to the household or family unit – for example, a home telephone. Private and domestic expenses are intended, at least in part, to further some personal purpose. 3.8 In principle, the general approach should be that an employee expenditure payment that is for a private (or domestic) expense of the employee should be taxed. Exceptions to the general approach 3.9 The next question to consider is in what circumstances we might move away from a full taxation approach. In doing so, we would tend to discount more fact-based considerations, such as the degree of nexus with employment and focus instead, in the interests of simplicity and certainty, on more practical considerations. 3.10 In the next part of this chapter, we consider a number of scenarios involving a payment being made to meet the cost of a meal and the question of how the payment should be taxed. Matters we have taken into account in considering the question are:  whether any private element is low in value and incidental to the work expense, or low in value and hard to measure;  whether not taxing the payment would encourage salary substitution; and  whether not taxing the payment is consistent with the approach taken under the FBT rules when the goods or services are provided directly by the employer. 9 C of IR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198. 14 Employee meals in general 3.11 The New Zealand courts have not given much further general guidance than Richardson J’s comments in Haenga on the meaning of “private expenditure”, but have considered particular types of expenditure, including food and drink. In Case E80, 10 which considered the nature of out of town meal expenses for a removal van driver, Barber J found that the expenditure did not have the necessary relationship with the earning of the taxpayer’s income: “In my view there is no necessary relationship between the expenditure by O on meals and the earning of O’s income. The meals were purchased by O in order to live and not to perform O’s job. The expenditure was not incidental and relevant to the earning of income but was incidental and relevant to O’s physical sustenance.” 3.12 Barber J did acknowledge that, when the requirements of the taxpayer’s job mean that extra cost is incurred on meals and there is clear evidence of that, then there may be a sufficient nexus between the expense and earning the income from the employment. An example would be when the employee is required by his or her job to work out of town and, therefore, has to spend more on their meals than usual. 3.13 Nevertheless, food and drink are more commonly private expenditure since any meals purchased are to provide the employee with personal sustenance in order to live. They are not generally part of performing an employee’s job. Whether an employer pays an employee wages so they can buy food and drink or some form of meal payment, the outcome is the same and, at least in principle, the meal payment should be taxable. 3.14 It is certainly arguable that when an employee incurs extra meal costs during a work journey, then that additional cost is not private expenditure. However, the amount saved on the employee’s normal day-to-day expenditure remains private expenditure. The question is whether this argument can be reflected adequately in the options proposed in this chapter, given that, for many employers, it will not be practically possible to comply with or administer a test that requires an apportionment to be made. Identifying the private part of the expenditure would require consideration on an employee-by-employee basis of their meal consumption which could change from day to day. 3.15 There is a range of circumstances in which an employee might be provided with some form of meal payment by their employer. The most common appear to relate to:  work travel – when an employee has extra meal costs because they have had to work away from their normal place of work over a meal period; 10 Case E80 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,421. 15  non-work travel related: – working lunches (and other working meals) – when the needs of the job mean an employee has to work through a meal period; – conference meals – when an employee attends a work-related conference that extends through a meal period; – light refreshments, such as tea and coffee – when employees work away from their employers’ premises and cannot use tea and coffee ordinarily provided to on-premises based staff. Employee meals during work travel 3.16 Commonly, employers make payments to meet employee meal costs when their employees are travelling away from their normal place of work on work-related duties through a meal period. This may be for a specific journey of short duration, or for a longer period such as a secondment. 3.17 Employers recognise that their employees may have to spend more on their food and drink than they usually would when travelling away from home for work. Therefore, they will normally meet their employees’ meal expenses in such circumstances, to a varying extent. This recognises the fact that employees may be reluctant to travel if it means they are likely to be out of pocket for work-related costs. However, employers will also want to control costs on what can be a substantial work expense. For example, some employers may limit meal reimbursement payments to work journeys when an overnight stay is required, and make or set a daily payment, or an amount based on a monetary limit – either with a fixed upper limit or by reference to what is a “reasonable” amount. 3.18 Employers meet their employee meal expenses in different ways, depending on their internal procedures and sensitivity to administrative costs. This might be by settling the bill directly (for example, through the employee using a company credit card), by reimbursing actual expenses (for example, on receipt of a claim by the employee), or by paying an allowance (for example, based on an estimate of restaurant costs for a particular location). Low in value, incidental to earning employment income and hard to value 3.19 Any comparison between meal costs when travelling on a work journey and normal day-to-day meal costs is likely to be between the cost of dining out and self-catering (at least for short-term business journeys rather than longer term secondments). An employee usually stays in a hotel, or similar accommodation, without self-catering facilities and therefore has to buy catered food. In these circumstances, the amounts saved by the employee are likely to be variable and very difficult to measure. When short-term work travel is concerned, the private element of any meal costs is also incidental to the need to travel. 16 3.20 When an employee undertakes a longer journey or secondment, this is likely to change after a period of time. An employer is likely to be reluctant to fund restaurant meals on a long-term basis and the employee will often move to self- catering accommodation. At that point the meal costs are not likely to be significantly greater than the normal day-to-day costs at home and the case for allowing tax-free treatment becomes more questionable. Salary substitution 3.21 Reimbursing an employee’s meal costs is unlikely to lead to significant salary substitution when the employee is travelling on a short-term work journey because the cost of meals is generally ancillary to the cost of the travel. Employees would normally expect to have their expenses reimbursed on top of salary and not see it substituted. However, there could be salary substitution risks if allowances are paid and the employee does not have to account for matching expenses. Match with FBT 3.22 When the employer provides a meal while the employee is travelling (for example by booking and paying for the meal, along with other expenses, centrally), then the meal is exempt from FBT to the extent that an allowance to meet the cost would be exempt. 11 The FBT rules, therefore, follow the approach used with allowances. 3.23 Meals provided off the employer’s premises are normally treated as entertainment expenditure and the employer’s tax deduction is limited to 50 percent of the expenditure as a proxy tax impost with no tax charge for the employee. Meals consumed in the course of business travel are normally excluded from this treatment. Options 3.24 We have identified a number of options for determining the tax treatment of meals during work travel. 12 In arriving at these, we have already concluded that the practical difficulties in apportioning expenditure on meals between normal and additional meal costs while travelling for work reasons mean that apportionment is not a realistic option. 3.25 The options we have identified are:  Exempt from tax payments to meet meal costs – Employers and employees would not need to apportion any payments once they establish that meal expenses have been incurred on a work journey to a location other than the employee’s normal work location. The advantage for employers is obvious, particularly since our understanding is that, in practice, employers do not apportion expenditure. However, a disadvantage is that the option may not adequately address the possible incentive to make tax-free payments when an employee is sent to work at a particular location for a longer period of time, when their meal costs are likely to reduce and become more in line with their normal day-to-day expenditure. 11 Sections CX 5 and CX 19. 12 Work travel does not include commuting between the employee’s home and normal place of work. 17  Exempt from tax payments to meet meal costs, but limit to overnight journeys – This would assume that when a work journey does not involve an overnight stay the employee does not incur significant additional meal costs. This is an approach Australia follows. 13 However, this approach would not recognise that some employees may incur additional costs even when an overnight stay is not required.  Set an upper time limit for making tax-free meal payments – This is a variant on the first option and recognises that when an employee is away from their normal work location for a limited period of time they are likely to have to incur significantly higher meal costs. However, after a reasonable period of time in a particular location, they and their employers are likely to make arrangements to reduce the additional meal costs – for example, by the employee moving into self-catering accommodation. After an appropriate period, therefore, any employee expenditure payments should become taxable. This option has the advantages of the first option in resolving the apportionment issue but also seeks to recognise the potential reward element of reimbursing meal costs for longer trips to a particular location. However, an upper time limit would have to be a one size fits all approach. Any limit would act as a cliff edge, which inevitably means that some employees will find themselves on the wrong side of it.  Exempt from tax a fixed portion of any payment to meet meal costs – Under this option, whatever amount is reimbursed or paid by the employer, a fixed proportion would remain taxable. This would recognise that the employee is receiving a tangible benefit when their employer pays for their meals but overcomes the practical difficulties in identifying the amount saved by making a round sum adjustment. Such an approach is adopted by the United States of America and Canada which only give a tax deduction to the employee for 50 percent of expenditure on meals when travelling overnight on a business journey. However, it is a fairly arbitrary adjustment that has no regard to particular circumstances and would over- or under-tax in many instances.  Set a maximum amount that can, with certainty, be paid tax-free – This would provide a threshold below which the employer could reimburse the full amount tax-free. The benefit of this approach would depend on the amount it is set at. If set too low, it would be of little value to an employer who would still have to make an adjustment. If set too high, it could provide an incentive for salary substitution. Either way, there may be a need for criteria to be set by Inland Revenue to allow the exemption to continue if the cap is exceeded – for example, if the meal expense is incurred in a particularly expensive part of the world. There may be some value to employers in this approach, however, if the capped amount could be used more broadly as a daily amount that employers could pay without having to check employee records in detail (similar to the approach in the United Kingdom). 13 See Appendix C for summary of approach in other countries. 18 Preferred option 3.26 On balance, our preference is to fully exempt the payment, subject to an upper time limit for this treatment at any given temporary work location. This would mean that an employer would not have to worry about identifying the notional private/work split of any meal payment – it would either be not taxable at all, or taxable in full. 3.27 Setting an upper time limit for tax-free treatment would recognise the significant additional meal expenses normally incurred during work travel. However, it would also recognise that a meal payment is inherently private and that after an appropriate period of time the additional costs are likely to reduce and any meal payment will be more in line with an employee’s normal day-to-day spending on meals. 3.28 Setting an upper time limit would provide a clear boundary that should be easy to understand and apply. It would provide employers with certainty and resolve many of the problems around identifying when a work location should be treated as temporary for the purposes of making a meal payment. It would also leave it to employers to determine what amount they consider is appropriate to pay their employees by way of a meal allowance in different circumstances. 3.29 A time limit does provide a cliff edge though and where that limit is set would be important. Data about the length of business trips is not available. However, it is likely that most visits by an employee to a particular location (other than their normal work location) are for a relatively short period of time, usually days or weeks rather than months. As already noted, when meal payments are concerned, we would anticipate that when a trip runs into months, employers and employees will make arrangements to reduce spending on meals. 3.30 On this basis, an upper time limit of three months before a meal payment becomes taxable in full, would set an appropriate margin. However, we are interested in feedback on the pattern and duration of work trips to particular locations and what employers do in practice. Employee meals in other circumstances – working lunches and other working meals/ refreshments outside of work travel 3.31 An employee may have to work through lunch or some other meal time because of the needs of the job. For example, it may be more effective to carry on a meeting without breaking for lunch, or to conduct business at a lunch-time meeting or hold an early morning meeting over breakfast. Often, any food and drink will be provided or paid for directly by the employer – for example, by arranging and paying for the catering directly. However, there will be occasions when the employee has to pay for and claim reimbursement for any costs – an allowance in this situation would be less likely. It may also be unclear how much of the cost relates to the employee and how much to guests. 3.32 One variation is when the employee attends a work conference. Normally an employer will fund and pay for conference costs (including meals) directly. However, there may be occasions when the employee pays for meals and claims reimbursement for the costs from their employer. 19 3.33 Finally, some employers pay modest tea and coffee allowances to members of staff who routinely work out in the field away from their employer’s premises and cannot use the refreshments the employer provides on the premises. Low in value, incidental to earning employment income and hard to value 3.34 The cost of a working lunch or conference meal is usually reimbursed by the employer only when there is a particular work need. Working meals are not generally provided as a reward so the effective value to the employee is the saving they make over their normal day to day expenditure. This private element is likely to be low in value, incidental to earning the employee’s income and difficult to measure. 3.35 Tea and coffee payments related to the employee’s inability to obtain tea and coffee on the employer’s premises because they are working off site, are likely to be modest. Salary substitution 3.36 Working meals (outside of work travel) are likely to be intermittent, relatively modest and only provided when there is a work need. With these assumptions in mind, exempting payments to meet the cost of working lunches seems unlikely to encourage a material behavioural response towards salary substitution. 3.37 However, it might be necessary to prevent regular meal payments that are effectively rewards from being treated as non-taxable. For example, tea and coffee payments might need to be broadly linked to the value of tax-free refreshments the employer provides at the workplace and provided because the employee cannot access on- premises refreshments. Match with FBT and entertainment regime 3.38 A further matter to consider is whether exempting an employee expenditure payment on food and drink is consistent with other taxing provisions. Working lunches provided by an employer on their premises are already exempted from being treated as fringe benefits although entertainment tax may apply in some instances to limit the employer’s deduction to 50 percent of the expenditure. In certain circumstances, when food and drink is provided away from the employer’s premises the entertainment expenditure rules also remove any potential FBT charge but limit the employer’s tax deduction to 50 percent of the expenditure. Working lunches are currently being taxed through the entertainment limitation. 3.39 Exempting modest off-site tea and coffee payments when provided because the employee cannot access on-premises refreshments would align with the FBT exemption that applies when light refreshments are provided to an employee on the employer’s premises. 20 Options 3.40 The following two options have been considered:  Exempt from tax any payments to meet working meal/ light refreshment costs, subject to an upper monetary limit – A key advantage of this approach is that it provides a clear and easily understood boundary that would provide an exemption for reasonable amounts. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that it would introduce a cliff edge which could result in employers having an incentive to pay up to the boundary, but no more. This would require maintenance to keep it up-to-date. There might also be problems in allocating expenditure to particular employees and for employers ensuring spending fits the cap. It would also introduce an inconsistency with the FBT and entertainment rules. One variation on this option would be to define the upper limit in terms of “reasonable” expenditure on meals. However, while it could provide a more flexible boundary it would introduce a new subjective test and further uncertainty around what is meant by “reasonable”.  Exempt from tax any payments to meet working meal/ light refreshment costs – This approach would exempt employee expenditure payments to meet the cost of working meals or light refreshments, but not provide particular limits. This approach leaves judgements about when and how much to fund working lunches to employers who would not have to worry unduly about tax consequences. It would not be inconsistent with the FBT rules which provide that food and drink provided off the employer’s premises is not taxed as a fringe benefit when subject to the 50 percent deduction limitation under the entertainment expenditure tax rules. The disadvantage of this approach is the small risk that working meals and refreshments could become a vehicle for salary substitution or simply a means to provide an additional tax-free reward. The circumstances in which the exemption would apply would need to be clarified and require, for example, that it is not provided to a particular employee on a frequent basis or as a reward for services. Preferred option 3.41 Overall, when a meal payment is provided in work circumstances and is not intended to reward its employees, our preference is to exempt the payment. When the meal is provided as part of entertainment, any payment will already be taxed through the employer’s business under the entertainment rules by restricting the employer’s tax deduction. 21 3.42 The rule would have to be carefully crafted to make it clear that this does not extend to circumstances when the payment is made on a regular basis for the employee providing his or her services. Additionally, when light refreshments are concerned, any payment might have to be linked to what the employer provides to its staff, tax- free, on its premises more generally, limited to relatively modest amounts and only to situations when the employee has to work regularly on site away from the employer’s premises. 22 CHAPTER 4 Accommodation payments  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet an employee’s accommodation expenses during work travel away from the employee’s normal workplace should be exempt from tax, subject to a 12-month upper time limit at a particular work location, with a power for the Commissioner to extend that time limit in certain exceptional circumstances.  When an employee is provided with accommodation by their employer at or near their normal workplace, the value of the accommodation should be taxable to the employee based on the market rental value of the property, after taking into account any employee contribution to the cost of the accommodation.  When an employee has more than one permanent workplace for the same job, one option is not to tax employee expenditure payments to cover accommodation costs at one workplace.  A valuation method other than market rental value may be needed to establish the taxable amount when the accommodation is in an overseas location – for example, a valuation by reference to comparable New Zealand accommodation. 4.1 Once the private element of an employee expenditure payment is identified, a key issue is to determine the value which should be taxed. 4.2 Identifying the taxable value will often be straightforward. For example, when the entire expense the payment meets is private, the whole of the employee expenditure payment should be taxed. However, problems arise around identifying the taxable value when the payment is not wholly to meet a private expense and there is also a work element. 4.3 This chapter considers issues around how the private element of accommodation payments or payments to meet housing costs should be valued. It includes payments to meet the employee’s accommodation costs, both at their normal place of work and when on a work journey. It also looks at issues that arise when, rather than making an accommodation payment, the employer provides the accommodation to the employee directly. 23 Policy issues in considering accommodation payments 4.4 Accommodation is a fundamental human and personal need and will normally be “private or domestic expenditure” as defined in CIR v Haenga. 14 Employees need accommodation of some form to provide them with the necessary shelter and facilities for eating, washing and sleeping as part of their normal day-to-day living. Expenditure on employee accommodation is not usually incurred in the income- earning process. Instead, it merely puts an employee in the position to be earning income. See, for example, Case G57 15 when the court held that the lodging costs of a mussel farmer were not deductible because they were to put him in a position to tend his mussel farm for the production of income and were not incurred in gaining or producing the income from the farm. 16 4.5 Consequently, when an accommodation payment is provided to meet an employee’s accommodation costs, it could be expected that the full amount of the payment would be taxed. Alternatively, if the employer provides the accommodation, the starting point ought to be that the accommodation benefit is taxed when the employee does not pay full value for using it. The taxable amount can generally be considered to be the market value of the accommodation less any contribution from the employee. Market value is usually regarded as equal to the market rental value of the property. 4.6 If the accommodation payment is simply paid as part of an employee’s remuneration package, the taxable amount should be the full amount of the payment. There is little difference between salary which can be used by an employee to pay his or her rent or mortgage and a cash payment to do the same. Therefore, no adjustment should generally be made to the gross amount of the payment. Similar considerations apply if the accommodation is provided by an employer. 4.7 The following paragraphs consider how the taxable amount might vary in different circumstances and what adjustments might need to be made – both when provided by way of an accommodation payment to meet an employee’s costs, or by an employer providing the accommodation. 4.8 Consistent with the approach adopted in relation to meal payments, our suggestions about the amount to be taxed take into account the following considerations:  any variation in treatment, including to help identify the overall private element, should be easy to measure; and  not taxing the full payment should not encourage salary substitution. 14 C of IR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,199, see paragraph 3.6 of Chapter 3. 15 Case G57 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,251. 16 Although this case concerned whether an employee could claim a tax deduction, something an employee can no longer do, the principles are still relevant to considerations of the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments linked to accommodation costs. 24 4.9 We have identified a number of situations when it seems appropriate to tax less than the full value. These are:  Accommodation during temporary work travel – When the employee is temporarily working away from his or her normal place of work. An example of this is when an employee who lives and works in Wellington is required to stay overnight in Auckland in the course of his or her job. A further example is when an employee who lives and works in Auckland is required to work in Christchurch for a month and is reimbursed the cost of his or her motel room.  Accommodation provided because of the needs of the job – When the needs of the job mean an employee is required to live in a particular property in order to carry out his or her work duties. An example of this is an on-site caretaker or school hostel warden required to live in a particular property because he or she is on call out of working hours and needs to respond immediately.  Other circumstances – There are also a limited number of other circumstances that do not fit easily within any general rule and which may warrant separate consideration. Examples include employees with more than one permanent workplace for the same job and employees working in countries outside New Zealand. Accommodation during temporary work travel 4.10 “Temporary” means that something is only expected to last for a limited period of time. So, temporary work travel concerns travel an employee undertakes because of the needs of the job that is only expected to last for a limited time, usually for a relatively short period. When an overnight stay is required, the travel costs include the cost of the employee’s accommodation. 4.11 A payment to meet accommodation costs incurred when an employee is required to stay in temporary accommodation because of work requirements may be for an overnight stay on a work trip away from the employee’s normal workplace. Alternatively it could be for a more substantial temporary secondment to a workplace in another city. The costs will usually be additional to the employee’s normal day-to-day accommodation costs, assuming the employee is staying temporarily away from the place where he or she lives. Salary substitution 4.12 Meeting an employee’s accommodation costs is unlikely to lead to salary substitution when the employee is travelling temporarily on a work journey, as long as the payment is closely linked to the amount of the expense. Even if the employee has not retained a property at the normal place of work, there is unlikely to be salary substitution. 25 4.13 However, there may be salary substitution when an employee can be paid a tax-free employee expenditure payment rather than salary or wages. A recent illustration of the risks in this area can be seen with the Australian “Living Away From Home allowance” (LAFHA) 17 tax rules which the Australian Treasury reports have been used by employees to substitute large tax-free allowances in excess of actual expenditure on accommodation and food for taxable salary. 4.14 The LAFHA rules have been changed to address this by making the qualifying criteria more stringent and by setting an upper time limit for paying the allowance at a particular workplace. 18 Options 4.15 We have identified several options for establishing the taxable value of accommodation payments when an employee has to travel temporarily away from his or her normal place of work requiring an overnight stay. 4.16 Making a specific adjustment for costs incurred by an employee when they retain a property elsewhere is not a practical option. This approach would present uncertainty and very significant administrative and compliance issues for employers, employees and Inland Revenue. Employers would have to make an on-going assessment of an employee’s personal circumstances, because these might change, and make subjective judgements about personal benefit and intentions. Employees would have to be prepared to subject their personal circumstances to scrutiny on an on-going basis in order to justify the tax-free treatment of business travel expenses. Inland Revenue would also have to administer and apply the law taking into account the individual circumstances of employees and make judgements which could appear to be arbitrary or inconsistent. 4.17 This approach would also present significant fairness or equity issues within the tax system. Employees working side by side who are incurring similar business travel expenses could find themselves with different tax outcomes depending on their personal circumstances and how those are assessed in determining the taxable element of any accommodation payments. Ultimately, there is a private benefit involved and the longer the payment continues the less tenable the argument that the retention of the other property is an extra cost created by the secondment and the more it is likely to be a personal choice of the employee. 17 LAFHA is an allowance paid by an employer to an employee to compensate for additional expenses incurred and any disadvantages suffered because the employee is required to live away from their usual place of residence in order to perform their employment duties. The part of LAFHA that is taxed is usually minimal as the taxable element is reduced by any reasonable amounts paid in compensation for accommodation and increased expenditure on food. 18 www.treasury.gov.au/ConsultationsandReviews/Submissions/2012/Fringe-Benefits-Tax-FBT-Reform-living-away-from- home-benefits 26 4.18 With these factors in mind, the options we are considering are:  Exempt an accommodation payment made when working temporarily away from the employee’s normal workplace – This option recognises that in the majority of cases, temporary accommodation costs are work expenses that are wholly additional to the employee’s normal day-to-day household costs. Full exemption would remove valuation issues, such as determining what might constitute “additional costs”. However, because this option does not set an upper time limit for making a tax-free payment, it presents a significant fiscal risk in allowing an allowance payment to be substituted for salary, especially if it becomes common to treat relocations as temporary in the first instance. In the longer term, an employee is likely to want to “normalise” their lifestyle in the new location and reduce their accommodation costs. Under this option, an employee who has been permanently relocated could receive an unlimited tax-free payment that would not take account of this and the very real private benefit he or she would enjoy.  Exempt an accommodation payment made when working temporarily away from the employee’s normal workplace, but subject to an upper time limit – Another option would be to cap the exemption by reference to an upper time limit. This would have the advantage of removing any requirement to compare accommodation costs in the temporary and normal workplaces yet ensure the exemption covers only temporary changes in workplace. This is the approach adopted by the United States of America when the employee is working away from their “tax home”, in Australia when an employee is paid a LAFHA (both with a 12-month time limit) and the United Kingdom when an employee has to work at a “temporary workplace” (with a 24-month time limit). In the case of meals, employees may adjust their spending at the new workplace relatively quickly to minimise their additional expenses. However, it will take longer for them to regularise their accommodation costs, which may continue to be additional to their day-to-day expenses at their normal workplace. It would, therefore, be appropriate to set an upper limit for accommodation payments that is longer than for a meal payment. There is a three-month time limit for tax exempt accommodation payments provided for under the relocation exemption. 19 However, if the employee is not permanently relocating, a 12-month period would appear reasonable. As already noted, this is the time limit adopted by the United States of America and Australia for similar payments. One drawback with this approach is that a time limit creates a “cliff edge”. Under the option, any time limit would also have to be linked to an intention that the employee is temporarily away from their normal workplace. Without this test, all employees could receive a tax free accommodation payment within the upper time limit, whatever the circumstances. 19 Section CW 17B. 27  Exempt an accommodation payment made when working temporarily away from the employee’s normal workplace, subject to an upper time limit and a power to extend the limit in certain circumstances – A variation on the previous option would be to give the Commissioner powers to increase the tax-exempt time period in prescribed circumstances – for example, when the employee is required to continue working at the temporary workplace for a longer period due to exceptional circumstances. This would provide employers and employees with a safe harbour while allowing additional flexibility in limited circumstances when the temporary accommodation costs continue to be additional to normal day-to-day expenditure. The Commissioner’s discretion would need to be restricted to well-defined and limited circumstances. Further consideration would need to be given to these circumstances, but initial thoughts are that they might encompass extraordinary events outside the control of the employer and employee that arise after the employee has started working at the new work location. These might include circumstances when a contract originally scheduled to finish within the upper time limit overruns because of changes made by the customer or an unforeseen event for example, a fire or natural disaster, that requires the employee to continue working at a particular work location beyond the upper time limit. Preferred option 4.19 On balance, our preferred option is to exempt from tax any accommodation payments when an employee has to work temporarily away from their normal workplace overnight, subject to an upper time limit of 12 months, with a Commissioner power to extend that limit in exceptional circumstances. This would satisfy the criteria that the taxable amount should be easy to measure and be unlikely to lead to salary substitution. Any changes to the tax treatment would also apply to situations when the employer provides the accommodation, rather than makes an accommodation payment, to ensure consistency of treatment. Accommodation provided because of the needs of the job 4.20 A further scenario involving an accommodation payment or provision of accommodation by the employer is when an employee is required to live in a particular property because of the needs of the job. This is not just because it might be more convenient for the employee to live in that location, but because the job cannot be performed effectively without the employee living in the particular property. Very few employees will be in this position. 4.21 When the employer makes an accommodation payment to meet an employee’s accommodation costs, it is unlikely that the needs of the job mean the employee has to occupy a particular property. The fact that the employee has arranged their own accommodation means that they are likely to have had a choice about where they can live. However, rather than paying an allowance, the employer may provide the employee with accommodation – either a property the employer owns, or one that it rents for the employee to use. The following discussions are, therefore, more relevant to that scenario. 28 4.22 Modern communications mean there are likely to be very few jobs that require an employee to occupy a particular property even if an employer chooses to provide one. When on call, most employees can use cell phones to cover out-of-hours duties and a car means they can travel where they are needed relatively quickly. However, there are a small number of occupations when the needs of the job mean an employee must live in a particular property. For example, a farm worker who has to live on the farm in case livestock need attending to at night. 4.23 There will also be other occupations when the employer will expect the employee to occupy a particular house so they are better able to undertake their duties. For example, a rural police officer who is required to live adjacent to the police station, or a diplomat who occupies a particular property in an overseas location in order to undertake official functions. 4.24 In these circumstances the employee might be occupying accommodation they would not otherwise choose to live in. This might be a particular location or particular property. The property might be in a more expensive suburb (issues around accommodation provided when working overseas are considered separately later in this chapter) or to meet work needs might require much larger or more lavish accommodation than the employee would normally live in. 4.25 In most cases, using market value should not cause a problem because this should broadly reflect the value of the private benefit to the employee. However, some large tax charges can potentially arise. There can also be an impact on the employee’s entitlement to social assistance, such as Working for Families, and their liability for child support, or student loan repayments. Options 4.26 While there may be some significant drawbacks to “living on the job”, an employee for whom the premises are their permanent residence will still obtain a substantial private benefit even if there is a work need for him or her to live in the property. With this in mind, we have ruled out introducing a full exemption in these circumstances. 4.27 Instead, we have identified the following options:  Tax the full value of any accommodation payment or employer provided accommodation, adjusted for a range of factors – This option would mean the taxable value of any accommodation payment made by the employer to meet the accommodation costs or market value of the employer-provided property would be adjusted down depending on a range of factors. These factors might be linked to the property, such as location and state of repair, or factors linked to the job, such as the inconvenience the employee suffers from having to live in employer-provided accommodation. If market value is based on the market rental value of the property, then this is likely to adjust automatically for factors linked to the property. For example, a property in a remote area is likely to have a significantly lower value than a similar property in a city suburb. Similarly, a property located in a particular work location may also affect the rental value. The quality of the property is also likely to be reflected in the market value. 29 There are also valuation factors linked to the employee and his or her job. These might reflect the obligation on the employee to live in a particular property he or she might not otherwise want to live in or a requirement to live close to the job. These factors are unlikely to be reflected in the value of the property because they can vary between individuals, depending on their perceptions and personal circumstances. However, when taking up employment with provided accommodation, an employee will often take this into account in his or her decision to take the job. An employer will often factor this in when setting the overall remuneration package. One of the policy criteria is that the overall private benefit to the employee is recognised. Assuming market rental value reflects the value of the particular property and the wider remuneration package reflects any disadvantages particular to the employee, arguably, no further adjustment should be made to the market value of the property or to the taxable amount of any accommodation payment.  Cap the taxable element of any accommodation payment or provided accommodation at a benchmark value – This option would link the taxable amount to standard values: for example, the market rent for a typical house or flat in a particular reference location. If the rent in the work location is greater than in the reference location, the taxable value would be capped at the reference amount. An advantage of this approach is that it avoids large tax charges arising when an employee is obliged to live in particularly expensive locations where they would not otherwise live, but for the needs of the job. However, this option would require reference properties to be identified, which would be problematic. This would have to be a fairly broad brush approach that would not recognise differences between particular properties, other than at a high level (for example, number of bedrooms). A further disadvantage is that it would mean the full private value might not be recognised which could provide an incentive for salary substitution at the margin.  Cap the taxable element of any accommodation payment or provided accommodation at a proportion of salary – The taxable amount could be capped at a proportion of the employee’s salary or wages. Consideration would need to be given to what that proportion might be. However, it could, for example, be linked to the average ratio of rental values to income, which might be around 25 percent of gross income. An advantage of this approach is that it avoids large tax charges arising when the employee has to live in a property with a value out of all proportion to the costs they would normally otherwise incur and which distorts the value of their remuneration package. It would ensure that any tax charges outside the control of the employee remain affordable and do not distort their income for Working for Families, and other social assistance and liability purposes. It would also ensure that in most cases the private benefit element continues to be recognised. When the employee has a variable reward structure (for example, because they are rewarded in part through overtime or performance pay) it might mean there would have to be an end-of-year adjustment to the taxable amount if a cap has operated during the year. 30 Preferred option 4.28 Our preferred option for job accommodation is to continue to base the taxable amount on the full market value of the property or accommodation payment. If linked to market rental value for a particular property this would broadly ensure that the private benefit to the employee, which forms part of his or her overall remuneration package, is properly recognised, without introducing new complicated calculations and exemptions which would be hard to apply or create inequitable or inconsistent outcomes. 4.29 Any circumstances particular to the property – for example, remote location or poor quality of the housing stock would be recognised in this approach. Additionally, particular features of the property – for example, when it is located within the employer’s premises – might also be reflected in the market value. Other circumstances 4.30 This part of the chapter considers the appropriate tax treatment of accommodation payments and employer provided accommodation in certain other circumstances. Home workers 4.31 In addition to the limited number of employees who must live in a particular property because of the needs of the job, more commonly, employees may work from home either from personal choice or because their employer wants them to do so. For example, an office-based employee may choose to work from home to avoid a long daily commute, or an employer may prefer to reimburse an employee’s home office costs rather than pay for additional commercial office space. 4.32 As a matter of principle, if someone uses part of their home in their work, it is appropriate to adjust the taxable value of any employee expenditure payment to reflect any additional work costs. The extent of that adjustment should reflect the particular circumstances. When a separately identifiable part of the home is used wholly for work purposes, it may be appropriate to base the apportionment on the area used. When there is mixed use, some other basis for apportionment may be appropriate. For example, by treating an accommodation employee expenditure payment as tax-free to the extent that it meets additional heat and lighting costs. 4.33 Generally, our consultations to date suggest that this approach does not raise significant issues. Apportionment issues are considered more generally in the next chapter. More than one permanent workplace 4.34 Work requirements may mean the employee has more than one permanent regular workplace for the same employer. For example, when an employee is required to work permanently in Auckland for two days a week and in New Plymouth for three days a week with substantive duties in each city requiring overnight accommodation in both locations. This is distinct from the situation of an employee with a permanent workplace some distance from their home who chooses not to relocate 31 but is able to work locally from personal preference or an employee with two separate jobs. 4.35 In the ordinary course of events any accommodation payment made to meet accommodation costs in either location would be taxable, even if rules were introduced to exempt accommodation at temporary workplaces – neither workplace is temporary and any upper time limit would be exceeded. However, in certain circumstances, it might be appropriate not to tax the accommodation costs in one location, recognising that the employee has to incur additional costs because of the requirements of the job to work in more than one location. 4.36 Under this scenario, it could be a requirement of the job that the employee had to work for a reasonable period of time each working week at the alternative work location and not just a matter of personal preference for the employee. For example, an employee may be responsible for day-to-day management of factories in two geographically separate locations. 4.37 If we were to consider this further, there would need to be a mechanism for identifying the non-taxable work location. We have identified the following options:  Employee nomination – Under this approach an employee who satisfies multiple permanent workplace criteria would nominate a particular workplace as their main workplace. An accommodation payment made in relation to accommodation at the other workplace could then be paid tax-free. The advantage of this approach is that once any qualifying criteria had been satisfied, no further judgements would need to be made and the employee would make a nomination to the employer.  Main place of work – This approach would require a factual assessment to be made about which workplace is the principal place of work – for example, the workplace where the employee works for most of his or her time. That would be treated as the main workplace for tax purposes and an accommodation payment made to meet costs at the other workplace could be made tax-free. This would require a subjective judgement to be made which might change as circumstances change.  Quality of accommodation – The first two options consider the position from the perspective of the workplace. They take no account of the nature of the accommodation – that is, whether it constitutes lodging or living accommodation. The particular concern is about employees who are required to live in temporary accommodation because of the demands of the job – normally for part of the week. Therefore, a further option is to exempt only accommodation payments made to meet short-term accommodation costs, such as hotel rooms or short-term lodgings – that is, accommodation without the means for independent living (in other words without cooking facilities). This option has the advantage of focusing on temporary arrangements that are not otherwise recognised by the more general rules discussed previously. 32 4.38 If rules were to be introduced to cater for the situation when an employee has more than one permanent and regular workplace, our preference would be for the second option under which the tax treatment of any employee expenditure payment is determined by the main place of work. Employee expenditure payments to meet accommodation costs at the secondary workplace could then be paid tax-free. 4.39 While this does not provide a “bright line” test, and requires a judgement to be made about the main place of work, this approach avoids the fiscal risk that might arise if the tax treatment was simply determined by reference to employee choice, rather than on the basis of the particular facts. Overseas temporary transfers 4.40 In some cases, the market value of the property the employer requires the employee to occupy because of the needs of the job is disproportionately expensive compared with the rest of the employee’s remuneration package. The focus is on employer- provided accommodation, but there may also be issues when an employee expenditure payment is paid. 4.41 We have in mind the scenario of an employee who is transferred to an overseas work location – for example, an employee who must live in the middle of Tokyo, where accommodation costs are particularly expensive compared with New Zealand. This is not an issue when the employee is no longer tax-resident in New Zealand. However, when the employee remains a New Zealand tax-resident, there can be some very high tax charges and social assistance entitlements or obligations implications. 4.42 Options for addressing this concern are similar to those identified earlier when an employee is required to occupy particular accommodation because of the requirements of the job. Our initial view is that, for the most part, market value will be appropriate as the employer should build any tax effect into the overall remuneration package. 4.43 However, it might be appropriate to cap the measure of the private value by reference to a percentage of salary or a standard property in New Zealand as outlined in the options discussed earlier. For example, one possible approach would be for the taxable value to be based upon the average market rental value of a similar property with the same number of bedrooms in Wellington or Auckland. Relationship with other tax rules Fringe benefit rules 4.44 As previously discussed, when an employer makes a taxable accommodation employee expenditure payment, the taxable value should normally be the amount of the payment. When the employer provides the accommodation, the taxable amount should normally be based on the market value, or rental value. These alternative approaches produce broadly the same tax outcome since the employee expenditure payment will normally be to meet the employee’s rent (or be a contribution to the rent). 33 4.45 In these circumstances, the market value is taxed as employment income rather than as a fringe benefit. One of the reasons for this particular treatment is historical, in that employer-provided accommodation was subject to income tax before FBT was introduced. 4.46 Employer-provided accommodation delivers a very significant benefit to an employee because it replaces a very significant part of his or her personal household costs. By treating the value of such a benefit as employment income, this ensures that it is taken into account in establishing the employee’s entitlement to tax credits such as Working for Families payments, as well as liabilities such as Child Support. Changing the rules so the benefit is subject to FBT would be more consistent with the treatment of major non-cash benefits and would tax the non-cash accommodation benefit at a more appropriate rate. 20 However, it would significantly distort the social assistance outcomes as fringe benefits are generally not included in income calculations for social assistance purposes. 4.47 It would, of course, be possible to change the law so employer-provided accommodation taxed as a fringe benefit is taken into account in determining social assistance entitlements and obligations. More general work is underway on the extent to which salary trade-offs should be included in social assistance calculations. In principle this would be a better, more consistent approach. However, this would create some additional compliance costs and increase the risk that the amounts are not included in practice. 4.48 On this basis, we prefer at this stage to continue to treat the taxable value of employer-provided accommodation as employment income for tax purposes. Relationship with relocation rules 4.49 There is a legislative exemption for relocation payments 21 to allow an employer to reimburse tax-free certain expenses incurred by the employee when moving their home as a result of a job move, or taking up new employment. 4.50 The relocation exemption allows expenses incurred up to the end of the tax year following that in which the relocation occurs to be reimbursed tax-free. The expenses that can be paid tax-free are provided in a Commissioner’s determination, Determination DET 09/04. DET 09/04 provides for accommodation, or the value of employer-provided accommodation once the employee has arrived in the new location, for up to three months after arrival, to be paid tax-free. 4.51 This exemption stands independently of any other tax rules. 4.52 We have considered whether we should link the accommodation time limit for the relocation exemption to any new rules affecting meal and accommodation allowances. However, we do not think this will be necessary if the 12-month time limit for paying a tax free accommodation allowance when temporarily working away from the employee’s normal workplace were clearly expressed as an upper limit. 20 Currently, a $1,000 non-cash accommodation benefit is taxed at a maximum of $330. To pay $1,000 in rent, the employee would need to earn $1,500, i.e. pay $500 in tax, not $330. 21 Section CW 17B. 34 4.53 Our preference is that both time limits should be linked to the employee’s initial arrival at the new workplace. Provided this is the same, the relocation exemption time limit would expire well within the temporary workplace time limit. When an employee takes advantage of the relocation exemption, this should also be an indication that he or she views the new workplace as permanent and the suggested longer time limit for temporary work travel would not apply. 35 CHAPTER 5 Communications and clothing payments  We suggest that employee expenditure payments to meet internet and other electronic communication costs should be taxed in full when meeting mixed work-related and private expenses and there is no separately identifiable work or private element.  We consider that employee expenditure payments to meet clothing costs should be taxed in full except when they relate to uniform, protective or specialist clothing required for the employee’s job. 5.1 In many instances when there is a mixed private and work expense, making an apportionment in order to arrive at the private or work element of any employee expenditure payment might be relatively straightforward, based, for example, on respective use. However, in some instances there is no separately identifiable private or work element. 5.2 In these cases, how should an apportionment be made? When the work or private element is likely to be low in value and hard to measure so that the administrative and compliance costs of making an apportionment would be disproportionate to determining the exemption or tax liability, should that element be disregarded? 5.3 This chapter considers these issues principally by reference to communication and clothing payments. Communication payments are those made to meet expenditure, typically when an employee is working away from the employer’s premises, such as the employee’s phone and other electronic communication costs. Clothing payments are payments for buying and maintaining clothing for use while carrying out employment duties. Policy considerations 5.4 The first issue to consider is how to make an apportionment between a mixed private and work expense. 5.5 The starting point is based on assumptions that:  When the private element is incidental, an apportionment should not be made.  When the private element is low in value and hard to measure, an apportionment should also not be made.  Apportionment, or no apportionment, of the expense should not provide an incentive for salary substitution. 36 5.6 “Incidental” is a commonly used term in tax legislation, but is not specifically defined. However, it is generally taken to mean something that occurs sometimes by chance as a minor accompaniment to something else, whether an expense or event. 5.7 So, if the private purpose is not independent of the work purpose, but is carried out in order to fulfil that work purpose, it will be incidental to the employment purpose. Similar considerations apply when the work purpose is subordinate to the private purpose. 5.8 However, there will be occasions when the private element of an expense is more than incidental, such as travel costs of a spouse when accompanying an employee on a work journey. 5.9 Often, it will be clear what the respective private and work elements are and the appropriate amounts to be attributed to each. This may be because there is a distinct private/work element or because the relative proportions are clear. In the example in the previous paragraph, the spouse’s travel costs are private and the employee expenditure payment that meets them should be taxable. Alternatively, when an employee works from home and sets aside a distinct part of the house for carrying out work duties, then any employee expenditure payments for the household costs may be apportioned by reference to floor area between the work and private elements. 5.10 However, in other circumstances, the private element may not be so clearly identifiable. If so, and the private element is low in value and hard to measure, an apportionment should not be made. 5.11 In considering these apportionment issues, the scenarios considered are:  Communication payments – The employer meets the employee’s home telephone, personal cellphone (or other electronic communications device) or internet costs, and there is mixed employment-related and private use, and part of the cost relates to private use and part to work use but overall apportionment is difficult.  Clothing costs – The employer meets the costs relating to the employee’s clothing worn while at work. Communication payment 5.12 The term “communication payment” in this chapter describes an employee expenditure payment to meet an employee’s phone, other electronic device or internet costs. 5.13 Working away from the employer’s premises has become increasingly common with the development of communications technology and flexible working arrangements. In many cases, the employer will provide the employee with a cell phone or other electronic communications device in the employer’s own name. If so, then the benefit is covered by a specific exemption from FBT and may not be taxed if it satisfies the criteria to be classed as a work tool including that it has been provided mainly for business use. 37 5.14 As an alternative, the employer may meet all, or a portion, of an employee’s costs, including the employee’s internet costs. Whatever sort of expense, the electronic communication facility is often to meet both private and work expenses with a single bill meeting the combined expense. 5.15 Part of the underlying expense may be specific to the private or work element (for example, individual calls), but part may be common (for example, line rental or a broadband facility). There may be a bundled package including mixed private and business elements to which no particular expense can be attributed. For example, when a phone package provides free calls as part of a single monthly fee. 5.16 If the employer meets the cost of a dedicated work phone line or internet facility with no, or only incidental private use, no apportionment should be required in order to tax the private element. When the employer meets the cost of what is effectively a private line with only incidental work use, an apportionment should also not be required in order to tax the payment. However, when there is mixed use that is more than just incidental, arguably an apportionment between the taxable and non-taxable elements should be made. 5.17 Whether and how this apportionment should be made is discussed below. Options 5.18 Technology developments mean that phone and internet access are now integral to most people’s private lives. On occasions, an employee may install a dedicated work line or buy a cell phone (or other electronic device) for exclusive use in their job. However, in such circumstances, it is more likely that the employer will make the necessary arrangements – for example, by providing a cell phone package. The FBT business tools exemption provides an incentive for the employer to do so. With this in mind, our starting proposition is that for the vast majority of people, personal phone and internet access will be primarily a private expense and any work benefit will be incidental. 5.19 For these reasons, exempting employee expenditure payments from tax when the associated expenditure is mainly a work expense, but the private element is more than incidental is not a workable option despite its alignment with the FBT exemption. This approach would ignore the potentially significant private value which might accrue and provide an incentive for salary substitution. 5.20 The options considered are:  Apportion between private and work elements on a “reasonable” basis – This broadly reflects the current approach that seeks to provide a split between private and work elements across all expenses. It would achieve a broadly equitable result, but requires an analysis of the underlying expense with associated compliance costs for employer and employee who would both have to monitor expenditure. Calls may not necessarily reflect the appropriate work element of the line rental. For example, the communications device may have been provided so the employee can be available when on call, or otherwise available to be contacted by the employer, but all calls made from the communications device are unlikely to reflect business use. Additionally, when there is no separately identifiable private or work element, such as call charges, any apportionment may be difficult to establish. 38  Tax a fixed ratio – Under this approach, a standard ratio, such as 50 percent of expenses, might be used to apportion expenditure. Many employers already adopt this approach as a rule of thumb. This option would recognise the intention to establish broadly the correct amount to tax in relation to the administrative and compliance costs, and likely revenue implications. In many instances, a fixed apportionment may produce a broadly reasonable result. However, it is, of necessity, arbitrary. It would require a set apportionment without regard to particular underlying facts and could over- or under-tax depending on the employee’s circumstances.  Tax any employee expenditure payment when there is mixed work and private use – Under this option, any reimbursing payment to meet expenditure with mixed use would be taxed in full. This is on the assumption that when private use is more than incidental, the employer has the ability to take advantage of the FBT business tools exemption and provide access to electronic communication devices tax-free as business tools. Such an approach would avoid the need to make arbitrary or complex apportionments of mixed expenditure. An employee expenditure payment would not, however, be taxed when there is a dedicated work facility or other separately identifiable and exclusive business cost being reimbursed. Preferred option 5.21 Overall, our preference is for the third option that would tax any communication employee expenditure payment when there is a mixed work and private expense that is more than incidental private use. 5.22 One of the aims of this review is to provide certainty by establishing clear boundaries between taxable and non-taxable payments that are easy to understand and apply. This approach would avoid the need to make arbitrary judgements about apportioning mixed-use expenditure. It would also recognise that the expense is mainly a private expense. When an employee has a significant on-going need to be contacted or to work away from their office, the employer is likely to provide the facilities in its own name – for example, by providing an electronic communications device or dedicated home office facilities. In these circumstances, the FBT rules will apply to exempt any benefit when work tools are provided mainly for use in the employee’s job. 39 Clothing payments The current approach 5.23 The New Zealand courts have considered the tax treatment of clothing on a number of occasions and concluded that expenditure incurred on the purchase and maintenance of clothing is normally a private expense. 22 Any employee expenditure payment to meet a clothing expense should therefore normally be taxable in full. 5.24 The general proposition that expenditure on clothing and its maintenance is normally a private expense was summarised in Case E51 23 which concerned clothing worn by a police officer. Judge Barber stated “Broadly, the authorities say that expenditure on clothing and maintenance is generally of a private nature and non-deductible”. Expenditure on conventional clothing (which might broadly be considered to be clothing reasonably suitable for private use) is a private expense, even when the employee is required to wear that particular clothing as part of a uniform (for example, see Case F45 24 which concerned conventional clothing worn by a ferry steward) and irrespective of whether the clothing is worn outside of the employment situation. 5.25 There is an exception to this general approach when the nature of the employee’s occupation means that “abnormal expenditure on conventional clothing” is required. In Case F9 25 , Judge Barber allowed a deduction to hotel managers for an amount representing the extra clothing (and dry cleaning) that was required because of the nature of their employment. In particular, it was observed that the taxpayer’s employment required them to maintain a larger stock of clothes and to clean and replace clothes more often. 5.26 An employee expenditure payment to meet clothing costs is also not taxable when the particular clothing is “necessary and peculiar” to the employee’s occupation (see, for example, Case F45, referred to above). This includes a uniform, or specialist clothing that is not reasonably suitable for private use. Examples include uniforms worn by nursing staff or members of the armed forces. However, ordinary clothing of a particular style or colour which could reasonably be worn outside the job would not be treated as a uniform. Specialist clothing might include overalls and protective boots worn in an industrial plant. 5.27 If the costs of particular articles of clothing are treated as exempt, any payments to meet the costs of cleaning and otherwise maintaining them should be likewise exempt – for example, when the employer pays a laundry or dry cleaning allowance that meets those costs. 22 Although these were decided under the deduction rules set out in the Fourth Schedule of the Income Tax Act 1976 which were repealed with effect from 1 April 1988, the principles derived from them are still relevant in determining the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments covering clothing expenditure today because they focused on the private nature of clothing. 23 Case E51 (1982) 6 NZTC 59,786. 24 Case F45 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,786. 25 Case F9 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,606. 40 Policy considerations 5.28 In the majority of cases the position is clear. When an employee wears ordinary clothing to work, the cost of maintaining and replacing that clothing is a private expense and any employee expenditure payment should be taxed. 5.29 However, uncertainty can arise around whether something is a uniform, or whether a particular employee or an employee in a particular occupation is required to buy and maintain extra clothing beyond what might be expected for an ordinary employee. Apart from identifying situations when this might apply, there are questions around identifying the additional expense. 5.30 When the employee is provided with what is essentially ordinary clothing, there is a very substantial private value that goes beyond being merely incidental to the work purpose. An employee may be required to wear something that they might not otherwise choose to wear. However, alongside meals and accommodation, clothing should be treated as being inherently private. This also means it is difficult to apportion ordinary clothing expenses between private and work elements, or even to make a judgement about a broad apportionment. Therefore, the primary approach should be to tax all or none of any employee expenditure payment to meet personal clothing costs. Abnormal expenditure 5.31 The principle in Case F9 was that when the nature and duties of the employment required the employee to spend more on buying and maintaining clothing than would be the case for an “ordinary” employee, extra costs were deductible. The case concerned hotel workers, but the principle applies more generally. 5.32 The previous chapters discussed the difficulties of taking account of an employee’s personal circumstances when working away from their normal place of work temporarily, in the context of meal and accommodation allowances. Similar considerations arise with clothing allowances. Questions around whether a particular clothing expense is excessive compared with other employees or occupations are difficult to resolve and not generally something that the tax system should have to make judgements about. 5.33 This paper has tried to focus on rules that provide clear “bright lines” between what is and what is not taxable. When possible, there should be clear rules that do not have excessively moveable boundaries. Rules that have to take account of personal judgements about what is and what is not ordinary clothing are not consistent with this approach. Therefore, in our view, while exemptions should be maintained for uniforms and other specialist clothing which might be subject to particularly arduous use resulting in excessive wear and tear, there is less justification for exempting payments for similar treatment for ordinary clothing. 41 5.34 This approach would be consistent with the FBT rules that apply when the employer provides the clothing or meets any maintenance and cleaning costs. There are specific FBT exemptions for “distinctive work clothing” 26 which cover uniforms and for protective clothing which are generally covered by the health and safety exemption. 27 Preferred option 5.35 Ordinary clothing worn at work is often indistinguishable from or interchangeable with clothing the employee might wear outside of work. In these circumstances, any employee expenditure payment is simply meeting a private expense. Therefore, our preference is to move away from the position that an employee expenditure payment in respect of personal clothing is to meet a private expense only in specific circumstances. 5.36 These specific circumstances are when the clothing in question is specific to the job in question and not something that is readily useable outside of work. A uniform, protective or specialist clothing that is not reasonably suitable for private use would fall within this category. Judgements about the tax treatment of clothing allowances that fall short of this standard lead to subjective questions about what an employee might be expected to wear at work in “normal” circumstances. These are questions that are impossible to answer with any certainty. 5.37 It is suggested that the law in this area be made more certain by making it clear that payments to meet clothing costs are taxable unless they concern expenditure on uniforms, protective clothing and other specialist work clothing that is not reasonably suitable for use outside work. They are taxable if they meet expenditure on ordinary clothing that can reasonably be worn outside the job, irrespective of the quantity of clothing or maintenance required. 5.38 This may result in some allowances becoming taxable – for example, hosiery allowances, but these allowances have already been built into pay in most cases. 26 Section CX 30. 27 Section CX 24. 42 CHAPTER 6 Current legislation, interpretation and delivery options  Alternative approaches to the current general legislation around the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments are considered, ranging from a fundamental change in approach to leaving the general rules unchanged but introducing a power to exempt particular payments by Commissioner determination-making power for the treatment of payments not addressed by specific rules.  Changes may be needed to the legislation concerning “expenditure on account of an employee” to remove ambiguities around the application of the general exclusions. 6.1 This chapter considers how well the existing legislation works for employee expenditure payments in general, beyond the most common payments considered in the previous chapters. The intended scope of the current legislation as well as its advantages and disadvantages are therefore examined and options discussed. 6.2 We also consider whether the mechanism within which any outcomes are delivered needs to be legislated so that employers, employees, their advisers and Inland Revenue can then apply them in practice. The current legislation 6.3 Section CE 1(1) treats any amounts derived by employees from their employment as employment income. This can take a variety of forms beyond salary or wages, and the definition of employment income is drawn widely. It includes amounts paid by way of an allowance, expenditure on account of the employee, and any other benefit in money. Allowances 6.4 The term “allowance” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 but case law 28 suggests that to be an allowance, an amount paid must have the following characteristics:  the amount must be paid in money to the employee;  the amount must be paid periodically or on the occurrence of certain events; and  the amount must be an entitlement, rather than a discretionary payment. 28 Stagg v CIR \[1959\] NZLR 1252 (SC), CIR v Parson (No 2) \[1968\] NZLR 574 (CA), Sixton v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,285 (HC) and Mutual Acceptance Co Ltd v FCT (1944) 69 CLR 389. 43 6.5 Case law has suggested that allowances only include payments for expenditure yet to be incurred by the employee and do not include payments relating to expenditure already incurred. In the case of M76, 29 Judge Bathgate stated that: “As a verb, the word \[allowance\] is said to mean “the action of allowing: a thing allowed”. By paying an allowance an employer pays to the credit of the employee, on account of the employee’s expenses to be incurred, a payment for such expenses. An allowance is not apt to cover the situation of an employer paying a debt owed to the employee, rather it is a payment for or to meet expenditure of the employee, yet to be incurred by the employee, for or on behalf of the employer.” 6.6 Adopting this interpretation, an allowance is not a payment for expenditure already incurred by the employee on behalf of the employer. The amount of the allowance can also be based on a reasonable estimate of the expected expenditure, rather than be an exact reimbursement of expenditure. 6.7 For example, in accordance with company policy to pay an allowance when it sends an employee on a business trip, an employer pays an amount of $300 to an employee before their departure to meet the employee’s estimated travel expenses on an overnight trip to Auckland. Expenditure on account of an employee 6.8 The second type of employee expenditure payment that is treated as employment income is “expenditure on account of an employee”. This is defined in legislation 30 in very broad terms as a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee. If a payment satisfies these requirements it is expenditure on account of an employee and treated as employment income for tax purposes, unless it is covered by one of the statutory exclusions. 31 If one of the statutory exclusions applies, the payment is not expenditure on account of an employee and the employee expenditure payment is unlikely to be employment income of the employee. 6.9 Within the statutory exclusions to expenditure on account of an employee, there are two general exclusions. 32 These cover:  expenditure for the benefit of the employee, or a payment made to reimburse an employee for expenditure to the extent that the employee would be entitled to a deduction if they incurred the expenditure and the “employment limitation” did not exist (this exclusion applies section CW 17 to the expenditure); and 29 M76 (1990) 12NZTC2469. 30 Section CE 5(1). 31 Section CE 5(3). 32 Section CE 5(3)(a) and (c). 44  expenditure committed to by the employer, paid for by the employee and reimbursed by the employer – for example, the employer orders and is invoiced for stationery, the employee pays for the stationery on the employer’s behalf and the employer reimburses the employee for the cost. It is important to note that, in these circumstances, nothing is really provided to the employee. The employee is acting as agent of the employer. From a policy perspective, such payments should be excluded from being expenditure on account of an employee. Is the amount exempt income under section CW 17? 6.10 Section CW 17 provides an exemption from tax for certain employee expenditure payments in whole or in part. The expenditure in question must be in connection with the employee’s employment and the provision exempts the income from tax to the extent to which the employee would be entitled to a deduction if the “employment limitation” did not exist. The employment limitation in section DA 2(4) denies employees a deduction for expenditure to the extent that it is incurred in earning income from their employment. 6.11 In determining the exempt portion of the income in question, an apportionment may have to be made between the deductible and non-deductible elements of the expenditure under consideration. The apportionment methodology is not defined, but depends on the employee’s circumstances and the particular requirements of the employee’s job. 6.12 The general deductibility provision in section DA 1(1)(a) requires there to be a sufficient relationship or nexus between the expenditure and the income-earning process of the individual claiming the deduction. 6.13 To be exempt using the guidance of the general deductibility provision, the expenditure under consideration must be incurred in the course of the employee earning their employment income. It is not sufficient that the expenditure puts the employee in a position to earn income. So, an employee expenditure payment to reimburse an employee’s travel costs between home and work is taxable since the linked expenditure is to put the employee in a position to earn their employment income rather than in the course of doing so. 6.14 When the expense is private, the general deductibility rule will not be satisfied. 6.15 An employee is also denied a deduction for the expenditure that the employee expenditure payment relates to if the expenditure is capital in nature. Section CW 17, however, ensures that this does not prohibit a payment including a depreciation element from being treated as non-taxable. 6.16 A more detailed summary of the relevant legislation is set out in Appendix B. 45 Alternative approaches to current legislation Applying the “nexus” test to employee expenditure payments in general 6.17 The previous chapters considered options for making it easier to identify the taxable amount when employee expenditure payments are made to meet the more common types of work expenditure. However, they do not cover every circumstance and a general rule is still needed. 6.18 The treatment of the specific payments would be legislated for in those cases and treated as if they satisfied the general rule or were a proxy for the general rule. 6.19 The question is whether, for the general rule, the current nexus test is the best approach, or whether there is another approach that could better achieve the necessary differentiation between an employee expenditure payment linked to a wholly work expense, a private expense and a mixed work/ private expense. 6.20 The current test does allow an employee expenditure payment in respect of expenditure incurred in earning the employee’s employment income to be exempted for tax purposes, but for anything which includes a private element to be taxed. This is consistent with the general aims of the tax system. 6.21 However, the current test does have some disadvantages:  The statutory tests require an assessment to be made concerning the deductibility of the employee’s expenditure in applying three hypothetical deduction tests that override the “employment limitation”: is the expenditure incurred in earning the employee’s employment income, to what extent is it private or domestic, and to what extent is it capital? Employees have not been able to claim deductions from their taxable income for over 25 years and applying a hypothetical deduction rule to amounts that could never be deductible may be seen by some as confusing.  A judgement must be made about the expenditure in question and its purpose. This may be relatively simple when it is or is not clearly a private expense, but this is not always the case – for example, study courses undertaken by an employee may have a benefit in the employer’s business, but also a private benefit to the employee in enhancing their human capital. The general rule provides no clarity in this case. 6.22 We have, therefore, considered some alternative approaches. Options 6.23 To address these issues, we have suggested the following approaches:  Incorporating into a general rule, the principles outlined in chapter 2 and followed in this paper in relation to specific payments – Being predominantly an exemption for low-in-value and incidental or hard-to- measure private elements. The benefits of this approach would be greater coherence and consistency in treatment across the range of payments. The disadvantage would be the potential for low-in-value and hard-to-measure items becoming more commonplace to take advantage of the exemption. An 46 assessment would continue to have to be made about the quality of the employee expenditure.  Simplify the current exemption rule for determining the taxable amount – It is arguable that the private and capital limitations are not a necessary element of the current approach since such an expense is not incurred in earning the employment income. Therefore, a further option is to abolish the existing deductibility test and replace it with a simpler exception test focused on the linked expenditure having been incurred by the employee in earning the income from the employment. Changing the approach could remove the need to apply the hypothetical deduction test and the private and capital limitations. However, this is essentially the approach taken by the courts in interpreting the relevant legislation in any case and identification and apportionment issues around distinguishing employment and whether there was a private benefit would still arise. This option would require new rules for establishing the tax treatment of an employee expenditure payment. However, these might reflect a simplification of the current rules without a radical change in approach. And a significant change in the wording of the exemption rule might give rise to unintended consequences and a shift in interpretation by Inland Revenue, taxpayers and the courts.  Continue to apply the current exemption rule but introduce a power to exempt or otherwise specify the tax treatment of particular payments by Commissioner determination – This approach would leave the existing rules unchanged. However, in the event that issues are identified around the tax treatment of particular types of payment in defined circumstances, further rules would be introduced. This approach would provide a practical solution for employee expenditure payments that were sufficiently common or widespread to warrant a specific determination. Feedback on preferred option 6.24 We have not expressed a preference for how the general rule should operate but would be interested in obtaining views on the options as well as any not considered in this section. Expenditure on account of an employee 6.25 The statutory definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” is very widely drawn, so there is a comprehensive list of exclusions from this definition. Although most of the exclusions in this list cover specific types of payment, there are two general exclusions set out in section CE 5(3)(a) and (c). These are important exclusions because they cover employee expenditure payments in general. 47 6.26 There have been a number of significant changes to this legislation since it was first introduced in 1985. 33 The changes have reflected major and minor reform of the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments. As a result of these changes, the general exclusions have been amended and expanded and it is no longer clear how the exclusions should apply, particularly in relation to each other. The general exclusion in section CE 5(3)(a) which only covered the payment of an allowance when first introduced now has wider coverage so, arguably, it now covers a wider range of employee expenditure payments. Options 6.27 Removing the ambiguity around the interpretation of the exclusions from expenditure on account of an employee would improve certainty around the tax treatment of employee expenditure payments. 6.28 This would require legislative change to the two general exclusions, either by:  amending both general exclusions to make a clearer distinction between when they should apply. A distinction would need to be made between reimbursing allowances, expenses incurred by employees and expenses incurred on behalf of their employers. This would require the way in which an employee expenditure payment is made to be considered in applying the tax rules;  replacing both exclusions with a single general exclusion. This would consolidate the general exclusions into a single exclusion. Since there would only be a single such exception, the way in which an employee expenditure payment is made would not need to be considered; or.  repeal of paragraph (c) in section CE 5(3). This would leave the paragraph (a) exception unchanged as the only general exclusion. Preferred option 6.29 The best option will be determined by the shape of the overall legislation relating to employee expenditure payments and a decision on the preferred option will not be apparent until that is clear. Capital limitation 6.30 An employee is denied a deduction for expenditure that is capital in nature. However, section CW 17(4) allows for a payment to include an amount of depreciation loss. The depreciation rules also allow low value assets (costing $500 or less) to be deducted in the year of acquisition. 33 Income Tax Amendment (No. 2) Act 1985 – see Public Information Bulletin No. 136 Part 3 February 1986. 48 6.31 In practice, this issue might arise when an employee is reimbursed for expenditure relating to the purchase of a capital item. An example includes purchase of a laptop computer for work purposes and the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of the laptop. Another example is a mileage allowance that includes a component for depreciation of the employee’s motor car when it is used for work purposes. The capital limitation would also be relevant to expenditure relating to a capital item, such as reimbursement of expenses relating to the cost of converting a room into a home office when an employee works from home. It is useful to bear in mind that often this type of expenditure will also have a private or domestic element to it. 6.32 To the extent that capital expenditure is incurred in acquiring an asset for use in the employee’s job, it would seem reasonable to continue to allow a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss. Estimated expenditure of employees 6.33 When an employee incurs expenditure for which he or she expects to be compensated, the employee will often itemise the amount of each expense. This will be the case when the employer makes a payment on account or reimburses particular expenses. However, many employers prefer to reduce administrative costs by paying an up-front allowance with the tax-free element supported by an estimate of the underlying allowable expense. 6.34 This approach is allowed by section CW 17(3). This section provides for the amount incurred for a relevant period to be based on a relevant estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred by the employee or a group of employees. The legislation is fairly broad and does not provide any further guidance or direction on how the estimate should be made, except that the estimate must be reasonable. 6.35 While many employers base their employee expenditure payments on the actual expenditure incurred (for example, setting a maximum amount the employee can spend on meals and accommodation and then reimbursing up to that amount) others, prefer to pay an allowance based on a daily rate. These daily amounts based on an estimated cost of hotel accommodation and meal costs, with different rates depending on location or the meals in question. 6.36 The advantage to employers of paying a daily amount is that they do not have to check individual expense claims for particular journeys. There is a saving on administrative costs in checking claims when the amount they pay out under either approach is broadly similar. 6.37 Provided a daily amount is supported by evidence to show that the employer has taken reasonable steps to establish that the amounts reasonably reflect the expenses their employees incur, this would satisfy the requirements of section CW 17(3). However, we would expect employers to monitor the level of expenditure and remain satisfied that the amounts are reasonable in the particular circumstances. 49 6.38 Framing the legislation in this way allows employers considerable flexibility in how they go about making an estimate, provided it is reasonable. We are not aware of particular problems in applying the rule and, therefore, are not proposing to make any changes to it. Delivery mechanisms 6.39 The proposals in this document will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. However, supporting rules may be better addressed through other mechanisms. These supporting rules may include, for example, how the Commissioner would propose to exercise the discretion to extend the 12-month period under which accommodation payments may be made tax-free. Importantly, they may also serve to provide clarity on the treatment of allowances not previously considered, including those where exemption is warranted because the amounts involved are low in value and incidental or hard to measure. Commissioner determinations 6.40 The Commissioner may issue binding determinations about various tax issues. These determinations generally represent statutory discretions exercised by the Commissioner relating to a specific tax issue. The determinations may, for example, set rates, values or types of deductible expenditure. 6.41 An example of a binding Commissioner’s determination is the power to provide, extend and modify the list of eligible relocation expenses under section CW 17B(6). 6.42 One of the options considered in this paper is an upper time limit for treating a visit to a particular workplace as temporary for the purposes of determining whether an accommodation payment can be made tax-free. Our preferred option is to set an upper time limit of 12 months but subject to a power to extend that in certain exceptional circumstances. We have suggested that those circumstances might include when a contract originally scheduled to finish within the upper time limit overruns because of some unforeseen event. It might be appropriate to introduce a power to set those circumstances by way of a Commissioner’s determination. 6.43 The taxability or exemption issues relating to particular allowances that are not covered by specific rules could also be dealt with through a determination process. We would expect these to be fairly limited and only made when the payment in question was widespread and its treatment demonstrably in need of identification. 50 APPENDIX A Comparison of current and suggested treatment of key employee expenditure payments Type of payment Current treatment Suggested Payment for employee’s meal expenses during work travel The amount the employee saves on day-to-day meal costs during work travel may be taxable because meal costs are generally treated as private expenditure. In practice, employers do not tax payments regardless of duration of travel. Payment tax-free if duration of travel to particular work location is no more than 3 months. Taxable in full for longer trips. Payment for work-related meals outside of work travel As for work travel, the amount the employee saves on their meal costs is taxable because it is private expenditure. In practice, employers do not tax these payments. Payment tax-free if not regular payment for employee services. Payment for employee’s accommodation expenses during work travel While generally not taxable, there may be circumstances when the expenditure is of a private nature and therefore taxable. In practice, employers do not tax these payments. Payment tax-free if duration of work travel to particular work location is no more than 12 months. Taxable in full for longer trips. Payment for accommodation costs outside of work travel The payment is taxable because accommodation is a private cost. No change, the payment would be taxable. Employer provides accommodation at or near work place The market value of accommodation is taxable. In practice this is interpreted to mean rental value and can take into account any contribution from the employee. Confirm the legislation to ensure taxable value is rental value, subject to any employee contribution. Payment for accommodation costs where more than one permanent work place In some circumstances the payment may be taxable because accommodation is a private cost. Special rules to ensure that a payment to meet accommodation costs at one location is not taxable in certain circumstances. Payment for accommodation costs for employees seconded overseas who remain NZ tax resident The payment is taxable, at a value based on market rent in the overseas location. Special rules to limit tax value – for example, NZ equivalent rent. Payment for communications (including telephone and internet) The value of any private expenditure is taxable and in practice this will mean an apportionment is required according to the private/work-related split. Taxable in full except where private/work element able to be separately identified. Payment for work-related clothing The payment is not taxable if the payment is for work uniform/specialist clothing. Confirm not taxable only when payment is for a work uniform/specialist clothing. 51 APPENDIX B Summary of current legislation and its interpretation The legislation for determining the tax treatment of payments to or on behalf of employees is set out in the Income Tax Act. 34 In order for a payment to be taxable as employment income, it must be income within Part C of the Income Tax Act 2007 and, more specifically, employment income within section CE 1. Provided a payment is employment income, section CW 17 then sets out the circumstances in which it is exempt income so that it is not assessable. There are also a number of specific exemptions in sections CW 16 to CW 26. These arrangements are different from circumstances when the employer incurs the liability directly and provides goods or services to the employee for their private benefit. In those circumstances the fringe benefit rules in subpart CX apply. Fringe benefit tax is then payable by the employer on the cost or value of any private benefit rather than income tax payable by the employee. The current statutory framework covering circumstances when payments are made directly to the employee or paid on their behalf is summarised in more detail in the following paragraphs. They consider, first of all, the general position before going on to consider certain specific circumstances. Payments made to or for the benefit of an employee Any amount derived by an employee in connection with their employment or service will be income to that employee under sections CE 1(1)(a) and (b) if that amount is either an allowance or is expenditure on account of an employee. Expenditure on account of an employee is defined in section CE 5(1) as meaning a payment made by an employer relating to expenditure incurred by an employee. A payment made by an employer in the section CE 5(1) definition includes both payments by an employer to a third party on an employee’s behalf and payments to an employee. Section CE 5(3) exclusions Section CE 5(3) contains exclusions from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee”. If a payment satisfies the requirements of the definition of expenditure on account of an employee in section CE 5(1) but is excluded from the definition by one of the exclusions in section CE 5(3), the payment will not be employment income of the employee. The two exclusions most likely to apply to payments made to or on behalf of employees for their expenditure are contained in section CE 5(3)(a) and (c). 34 All statutory references are to the Income Tax Act 2007. 52 The section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion covers expenditure on account payments that would be exempted under section CW 17. If section CW 17 applies, the payment is excluded from the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” and is not income. As the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion is aimed at payments intended to be exempted under section CW 17, the two types of expenditure on account payments it applies to are:  expenditure that is committed to by the employee but paid for by the employer (for example, the employer pays the employee’s phone bill on behalf of the employee); and  expenditure that is committed to and paid for by the employee and reimbursed by the employer (for example, the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of the employee’s phone bill). The exclusion in section CE 5(3)(c) applies to expenditure that is committed to by the employer, paid for by the employee, and reimbursed by the employer (for example, the employer orders and is invoiced for stationery, the employee pays for the stationery on the employer’s behalf, and the employer reimburses the employee for the cost of the stationery). The section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion covers reimbursements for expenditure incurred by employees in deriving their employment income while the section CE 5(3)(c) exclusion applies to reimbursements for expenditure paid for by employee’s on their employer’s behalf. These exclusions are mutually exclusive, so if a payment is for expenditure incurred by an employee in deriving their employment income, it is the subject of the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion and will not be within the scope of the section CE 5(3)(c) exclusion. Exempt income under section CW 17 Section CW 17(1) provides an exemption from tax for payments made by an employer to a third party on behalf of an employee for expenditure that the employee has incurred when the employee would be able to deduct the expenditure (or part of it) if the employment limitation in section DA 2(4) did not exist. The expenditure must be in connection with the employee’s employment or service and the employee must have incurred the expenditure in the sense of being legally liable for that expenditure. Section CW 17(2) provides an exemption from tax for payments made by an employer to an employee in connection with that employee’s employment or service to reimburse the employee for expenditure they would have got a deduction for if the employment limitation did not exist. Under section CW 17(1) and (2), an apportionment may have to be made between the deductible and non-deductible elements of the expenditure under consideration. This apportionment is a question of fact. Section CW 17(3) provides that, for a relevant period, the employer may make a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure likely to be incurred by an employee or a group of employees for which a reimbursement is payable. In practice, these types of reimbursement will be paid in the form of an allowance. 53 Deductions – general rules The deduction rules are set out in Part D with the general deduction rules in subpart DA. Section DA 1(1)(a) permits a deduction for an amount of expenditure to the extent that it is incurred in deriving assessable income. However, to qualify for a deduction, the expenditure in question must bear a sufficient relationship, or nexus, with the income. 35 The general deductibility permission in section DA 1(1)(a) requires there to be a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the income-earning process of the individual claiming the deduction. The expenditure under consideration must be incurred in the course of the employee deriving their employment income. It is not sufficient that the expenditure puts the employee in a position to earn income. Section DA 2 denies a deduction “to the extent to which” the expenditure falls within a number of general limitations The words “to the extent to which” provide that there may be an apportionment when part of the expenditure falls within one of the general limitations. The general limitations relevant to section CW 17 include:  The “capital limitation” in section DA 2(1). The capital limitation denies a deduction for any expenditure to the extent that the expenditure is capital in nature. However, the capital limitation will not apply to an amount of depreciation loss (see section DA 4).  The “private limitation” section DA 2(2). The private limitation denies a deduction for expenditure to the extent that the expenditure is of a private or domestic nature.  The “employment limitation” in section DA 2(4). The employment limitation denies a deduction for an amount of expenditure to the extent that expenditure is incurred in deriving income from employment. An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society, and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit. 36 Examples of expenditure that are often of a private nature include food, clothing and accommodation. Examples of expenditure that are often domestic in nature include a home telephone, an internet connection and furniture. When a benefit of a private or domestic nature accrues to the recipient, but this benefit is incidental to the income-earning or business activity of the payer, the deduction is not prohibited. When the private or domestic benefit accrues from a purpose of the taxpayer distinct from the employment purpose, apportionment is necessary. Accommodation allowances Section CE 1(1B) provides that the market value of accommodation, or an accommodation allowance, provided to a person in relation to their job is treated as his or her employment income. 35 The leading New Zealand cases on the deductibility of expenditure are CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 and Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485. These cases are authority for the proposition that there must be a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process for the expenditure to be deductible. 36 CIR v Haenga \[1985\] 7 NZTC 5198, in which Richardson J commented on the meanings of “private” and “domestic” (at p5, 207): “An outgoing is of a private nature if it is exclusively referable to living as an individual member of society and domestic expenses are those relating to the household or family unit...”. 54 When the employer provides their employee with actual accommodation, rather than an allowance or reimbursement, this differs from most other circumstances when an employer provides their employee with a non-cash benefit. The value of the accommodation is not a fringe benefit. When the property is owned by the employer, market value is the market rent that the property would otherwise fetch on the open market. If the property is rented by the employer, the market value is the rent paid by the employer. In both circumstances, the taxable value is adjusted for anything made good by the employee. Section CE 1(2) defines accommodation as meaning board or lodging, or the use of a house or living premises, or the use of part of a house or living premises. Accommodation benefits are taxed under PAYE. There are also two specific circumstances when the provision of accommodation or an accommodation payment is exempt from tax:  Section CW 25 provides an exemption for the value of personal board and lodging for members of religious orders or societies in certain narrowly defined circumstances. There is no general legislative provision, though, for a concessionary treatment for valuing accommodation benefits provided to a minister of religion.  Section CW 17B provides that relocation payments are tax-free provided certain criteria are met. When the employee is entitled to the relocation exemption, the provision of accommodation benefits is not taxed for up to three months after moving to the new location. 37 Other allowances Section CW 17C provides an exemption for payments for overtime meals and sustenance allowances. The exemptions set out certain criteria that have to be satisfied before payments can be treated as exempt income. Section CW 18 provides an exemption for payments by an employer to meet above normal transport costs that an employee has incurred in travelling between their home and place of work. A payment is exempt to the extent that the employee incurs the additional transport costs in connection with their employment for the employer’s benefit and convenience. The effect of sections CW 31 and CX 12 is that the payment of allowances to members of Parliament under the Civil List Act 1979 is taxed by way of fringe benefit tax, rather than under income tax. 37 See Determination DET 09/04. 55 APPENDIX C Approach in other countries The payment of allowances and reimbursement of employee expenses is a common feature of businesses across the world. The rules to cater for these sorts of payments are, therefore, also common features of other countries’ tax systems. The core features of the approaches adopted by the USA, UK, Australia and Canada are summarised in the tables below. These cover their approach to employee expenditure payments in general, meal payments and accommodation payments. In general, countries tax monetary payments to or for the benefit of an employee as income or as a cash benefit but reduce the taxable amount to the extent that the underlying expense the payment intended to meet is incurred for employment purposes. The common aim is to tax only payments to meet private or non-employment related expenses. Therefore, many countries also provide administrative easements so that payments that are matched by clearly allowable employment expenses are not reported. Common features in the USA, UK, Australia and Canada are:  The full amount of any payment to meet employee employment-related expenditure is taxable.  Deductions are allowed from the taxable amount when the underlying expense is to meet allowable business or employment-related expenditure incurred while performing employment duties.  Administrative easements apply so employers and employees do not need to report payments matched by clearly allowable employment expenses.  Statutory and non-statutory scale rates that can be paid without detailed checking of amounts are provided either by way of administrative practices or in legislation. However, there are variations around the world on the detail of how this approach is applied to payments in general and in particular circumstances. A significant difference from the New Zealand rules is that all these countries allow employees to claim deductions for employment-related expenses. 56 General allowances USA UK Australia Canada All compensation for personal services must be included in gross income. Includes allowances and reimbursed income. The amount of any ordinary and necessary business-related expense is deducted from income. Under an “accountable plan”, neither the amount reimbursed nor the matching expense are reported. Under a “non-accountable plan”, the reimbursement is included within gross income and the expense can be deducted. Claims for expenses are subject to a floor set at 2% of gross income. Claims for meal and entertainment expenses are set at 50% limit. Allowances and payments to reimburse expenses are taxed as income. Expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the employment are deducted from income. When “dispensation” issued, neither the amount reimbursed nor the matching expense are reported. “Benchmark” rates set in certain circumstances to allow tax-free amounts to be paid without detailed checking of receipts. An allowance received by an employee is taxable as income. Expenses incidental and relative to the employment are deducted from income. Reimbursed expenses give rise to a fringe benefit (expense payment benefit) on which employer pays fringe benefit tax. Exemptions if no private use declaration for reimbursement of employment-related expenses. An allowance or reimbursed personal or living expenses are treated as taxable income. Employees may claim a deduction for certain employment expenses. Reimbursement of out-of- pocket business expenses which is proved by vouchers does not have to be reported. Exemptions when “reasonable” allowances are paid for travel and motor vehicle expenses. 57 Meal payments USA UK Australia Canada The cost of meals is deductible from a payment if employee temporarily away from general area of tax home for substantially longer than an ordinary day’s work and the employee needs to sleep or rest to meet the demands of their work while away from home “Tax home” is employee’s regular place of business or post of duty (if more than one then main place, if none the place where the employee regularly lives). Temporarily means employee expects to work there for 12 months or less. Allowance not taxable if “accountable plan” - business expenses accounted for in full to employer, any excess over is taxable. Otherwise full allowance taxable. Employee may claim deduction for itemised meal expenses to 50% limit. “Standard meal allowance” method can be applied rather than actual costs but subject to 50% limit. Meals cannot be lavish/ extravagant. Meal expenses are deductible if there is a material change in the journey to work and the employee is required to travel to a temporary workplace. A temporary workplace is somewhere the employee has to travel to as part of their job for a temporary purpose or for task of limited duration. Temporary means employee expects to work there for two years or less. The additional cost of meals is allowed in full. In practice provided some expense is incurred, HMRC will also allow deduction for the amount saved from not eating at home. HMRC sets tax-free rates which can be paid if employees do not want to keep detailed records. May challenge if meals are lavish/extravagant. A meal payment is not taxable if it is paid to meet travel expenses incurred in earning assessable income. Applies when the employee travels away from their ordinary residence in the course of their duties. ATO interprets this as requiring a sleep away from home. Allowable travel expenses cover travel to an alternative workplace. 12-month time limit for Living Away From Home Allowance from 1 October 2012. ATO sets “reasonable travel allowance rates” each year. Provided the allowance is paid at or below those rates PAYG does not have to be operated on the allowance and it does not have to be returned. If employee spends more than the allowance they must keep detailed records if they want to claim the excess. If LAFHA paid, exempt amount is excess over standard weekly amount. Meal allowances are taxable unless they are received by the employee for travelling away from the area where the employee normally works or reports in order to carry out their job. Travel has to be away from the municipality and metropolitan area where the employer’s establishment is located and the employee ordinarily works or reports. There is no set time limit for travel. The meal allowance has to be reasonable. The Canadian Revenue Authority sets very broad guidelines about what it considers reasonable. As at 6 December 2011 it considered a meal allowance of $17 is reasonable. Claims for meal expenses are set at 50% limit. 58 Accommodation payments USA UK Australia Canada The value of accommodation or an accommodation allowance provided to an employee will usually be taxed as part of the employee’s compensation package. The taxable value is the fair market value (market rent), reduced by anything made good by the employee. Exemption for accommodation provided by an employer to an employee for the employer’s convenience on the employer’s premises if the employee is required to accept the lodging as a condition of employment. There are also specific exemptions for campus lodging, ministers of religion and lodging when temporarily away from the normal tax home (up to 12 months). The cash equivalent of employer provided accommodation is taxable. Taxable value is the rent paid by the employer less any amount made good by the employee. Special rules if owned by the employer, linked to rateable value of property and interest rates. Exemption if accommodation necessary for proper performance or better performance (and customary) of the employment duties. Exemption for accommodation at a temporary workplace (up to two years). But if private use, for example by family or lavish, then adjustment made to reduce tax free element. If part of accommodation necessarily used exclusively for employment purposes deduction may be given for appropriate proportion of expenditure. The market value of the right to occupy accommodation is taxable as a fringe benefit when the unit is the employee’s normal place of residence. The taxable value is effectively the market rental value of the unit, reduced by anything made good by the employee. Exemption when the employee is living away from their usual place of residence in order to carry out their employment duties, or travelling in the performance of those duties (up to 12 months from 1 October 2012). Special exemption for accommodation provided in remote areas. Payment of a LAFHA is a LAFHA fringe benefit. Taxable value is allowance paid less any exempt component. The exempt accommodation component is the additional accommodation expenses the employee could reasonably be expected to incur at the alternate location (depends on facts and circumstances) . The fair market value of employer provided board and lodging must be added to the employee’s salary, less any amount the employee paid to the employer. Exemption if the employee performs duties temporarily in an area where, because of the distance of the areas, they are not expected to return daily to their principal place of residence. Special exceptions for sports teams, members of the clergy and remote work locations. If the employee has to occupy accommodation larger than he or she needs, the taxable value can be reduced to the value of the accommodation the employee needs. If the employee’s privacy or quiet enjoyment is impaired because of the nature of the accommodation, the taxable value may be reduced.
Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 1 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz Taxation of foreign superannuation Why are changes being made? The current rules for taxing New Zealand tax-residents on their interests in foreign superannuation schemes are complex. Tax may be imposed under a number of different regimes, including the foreign investment fund (FIF) international tax rules, the dividend rules, and the trust distribution tax rules. It can be difficult to determine whether the FIF rules or other tax rules apply. Depending on which set of rules applies, your foreign superannuation is taxed either on an annual basis calculated on the value of your investment (under the FIF rules), or at the time you receive the income (for instance, a pension payment, a lump sum withdrawal, or a transfer to another scheme). The application of different rules can lead to differing results across people in similar circumstances. What are the proposed new rules? Under the proposed new regime for taxing your foreign superannuation, as outlined in the officials’ issues paper, the FIF rules would no longer apply. You would only need to consider whether you have New Zealand tax to pay when you receive a pension payment or lump sum, or when you transfer your superannuation to another scheme. If you receive a pension payment, you would be taxed as many always have been – at your individual marginal tax rate (ranging from 10.5% to 33%). A lump sum withdrawal or a transfer to another scheme would be taxed depending on how long you have been in New Zealand before you withdraw or transfer. Only a portion of the lump sum would be included in your taxable income. The remainder would not be taxable. This is called the inclusion rate approach. The proposed new rules are intended to be simple and easy to comply with. What is the inclusion rate approach? Once the necessary legislation is enacted, the inclusion rate approach would apply to lump sum amounts, both withdrawals and transfers to another scheme. Instead of paying tax on your foreign superannuation annually, this approach means that the tax liability on your foreign superannuation is typically deferred until you receive the income. The extent of the lump sum that would be included in your taxable income, on which you apply your marginal tax rate, would depend on how long you have been a New Zealand tax-resident for before you receive the lump sum. The longer the duration, the greater the amount that would be included in your taxable income. The proportion of the lump sum to be included would range from 0% (in the first two years) to 100% (after 25 years). Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 2 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz When would the new rules apply from? Once the legislation is enacted, the new rules would apply to income received from a foreign superannuation scheme – including pension payments, withdrawals and transfers to another scheme – on or after 1 April 2011. However, if your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was taxed under the FIF rules in the 2010–11 income year or earlier years, and you declared this income in your tax return by 31 March 2012, you would continue to apply those rules instead. Separate rules may apply to transfers or withdrawals of foreign superannuation made between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011. These are explained below. I transferred my superannuation to New Zealand several years ago and did not pay any tax on the lump sum amount. What do I do now? In some cases, no tax would have been payable on the lump sum. This is true if you had been properly declaring income on your foreign superannuation under the FIF rules at the time you transferred. You will have no further tax to pay on that lump sum amount. In other situations, the FIF rules would not have applied and so tax on the lump sum may have been payable. If you were not applying the FIF rules to your foreign superannuation at the time you transferred, once the proposals become law you can apply a single low inclusion rate to your withdrawal or transfer. The issues paper proposes that a small portion of the lump sum (such as 15%) would be included in your taxable income, on which you would pay tax at your marginal rate. The remainder would not be taxable. No use-of-money interest or penalties would apply. Alternatively, you can use the relevant tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or transfer, along with use-of-money interest and relevant penalties. This option would be available for transfers and withdrawals between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011. If you choose to apply a single low inclusion rate to your lump sum and the proposals in the issues paper become law, you would need to notify Inland Revenue before 1 April 2014. Details of how to make this disclosure will be provided once the policy has been finalised. I am a transitional resident and want to withdraw my superannuation from the foreign scheme. Do I have to do anything? New migrants who have been away from New Zealand for at least 10 years may qualify as a transitional resident if they arrive after 1 April 2006. Transitional residents are exempt on most types of foreign income, including foreign superannuation, for approximately the first four years of being a New Zealand tax-resident. If you are a transitional resident, your foreign superannuation – including any withdrawals or transferred amounts – is not subject to New Zealand tax as long as you remain a transitional resident. Under existing law, any earnings (such as interest income) on an amount of superannuation that is brought to and invested in New Zealand may be taxable while you are a transitional resident. This tax treatment is not affected by the proposals. Policy Advice Division factsheet July 2012 3 taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz I have superannuation in a foreign scheme from when I worked overseas, which I have not yet brought to New Zealand. Do I have to do anything? If your superannuation is still in the foreign scheme, you would not need to do anything under the proposed new rules until you receive a pension or lump sum, or transfer to another scheme. At that point, and once the necessary legislation is enacted, you would either pay tax on your pension or apply the inclusion rate to the lump sum withdrawal or transfer and pay tax on the result. Alternatively, if you previously paid tax under the FIF rules on your foreign superannuation in the 2010–11 or earlier income year by 31 March 2012, you would continue to apply the FIF rules. Any income that you actually receive would not be taxed under the proposed new rules. I ceased being a transitional resident in the 2011–12 income year. In that year, I paid tax under the FIF rules on my foreign superannuation for the first time. Am I able to continue to use the FIF rules? To be able to continue using the FIF rules in future income years, the current proposals would require you to have returned FIF income for the 2010–11 income year by 31 March 2012. As you were not subject to the FIF rules in the 2010–11 income year due to being a transitional resident, once these proposals become law you may not continue to use the FIF rules. When you receive income from your foreign superannuation scheme in the form of a lump sum or pension, you would be taxed under the new rules. Any FIF tax that you have already paid would be refunded to you or used to offset any tax payable on receipt of the income. I have superannuation in an Australian scheme and want to transfer it to New Zealand. How will this be affected? In most situations, foreign superannuation held in an Australian superannuation scheme would not be taxable annually under the FIF rules. Instead, you would need to consider how it would be taxed when you make a lump sum withdrawal or transfer. Under the Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement, if you receive a lump sum amount from Australia under a retirement benefit scheme, or in consequence of retirement, it is not taxable in New Zealand. You would not be taxed under the proposed new rules. If the double tax agreement does not apply, transfers into a KiwiSaver scheme from an Australian superannuation scheme may still be tax-free under an agreement on the portability of retirement savings between Australia and New Zealand. This is not yet in force, but will come into effect shortly after both countries inform each other that the necessary legislation has been enacted. In New Zealand, the relevant legislation was passed in 2010. Once your superannuation has been brought to and invested in New Zealand, any investment gains (such as interest income) will be taxable under existing law. That is, the current tax treatment of such income will be retained.
Taxation of foreign superannuation An officials’ issues paper July 2012 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Treasury First published in July 2012 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, 6140. Taxation of foreign superannuation – an officials’ issues paper.

Instead, the proposed new rules would provide that all pension payments would remain taxable in full on receipt. Lump sum withdrawals or transfers would be partially taxed on receipt. The tax would approximate the amount of tax on investment gains that would ordinarily have accrued during the period that an individual is resident in New Zealand, had the individual transferred the original amount to New Zealand. 1.6 The temporary exemption for transitional residents will continue to apply to receipts from foreign superannuation schemes. Other rules that exempt Australian superannuation in certain circumstances (such as the New Zealand-Australia double tax agreement, and the arrangement on trans- Tasman portability of retirement savings) will also remain unchanged. 1.7 The changes would be included in a tax bill scheduled for introduction later this year or towards the middle of next year. Summary of suggested changes  Tax on all “foreign superannuation interests” would be governed by the new rules. They would be specifically excluded from the FIF rules.  “Foreign superannuation interests” would be based on the current definition of “foreign superannuation scheme” in the Income Tax Act 2007. 2  All foreign superannuation would be taxable on receipt, as follows: 1. Pensions would be taxed at an individual’s marginal tax rate when the payments are received. 2. Lump sums would be partially taxed using an “inclusion rate”. The excluded amount would not be taxable. The amount that is taxable would depend on the length of time between when an individual arrives in New Zealand and when they withdraw or transfer the superannuation. At the time of the withdrawal or transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme, they would apply the relevant inclusion rate based on the date they became a New Zealand-resident as follows: Years since migration Inclusion rate 0-2 0% 3-4 15% 5-8 30% 9-12 45% 13-16 60% 17-20 75% 21-24 90% 25+ 100% An individual’s marginal tax rate would be applied to the amount that results after applying the inclusion rate. For example, an individual with a marginal tax rate of 33% who makes a withdrawal of $50,000 when they have been a New Zealand-resident for eight years would have a tax liability of $4,950 (being $50,000 x 30% inclusion rate x 33% tax rate). In this case, this represents an effective tax rate of approximately 10%.  The temporary exemption for the foreign income of transitional residents will continue to apply, as will certain rules that exempt Australian superannuation.  The proposed new rules would apply from the 2011–12 income year. However, people who returned FIF income from their foreign superannuation for the 2010–11 income year by 31 March 2012 would continue to have that interest taxed under FIF rules. They would not be taxed on any subsequent distributions under the new rules.  A retrospective measure would allow people who withdrew foreign superannuation as a lump sum between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011 and who did not comply with their tax obligations at the time to elect to use an inclusion rate of 15% for their withdrawal or transfer. To qualify, an individual must disclose the existence of the transfer to Inland Revenue before 1 April 2014. Alternatively, they can choose to return income under the rules which existed at the time. 3  Some people who have transferred their foreign superannuation to a New Zealand superannuation scheme may have a tax liability on that amount. If the New Zealand scheme is “locked-in” and so does not allow access to the funds until retirement age, the individual may have difficulty paying their tax. Officials invite comment on whether there should be a mechanism that allows tax to be paid from the transferred amount held in the New Zealand superannuation scheme and, if so, how this should operate.

It also outlines the reasons why a review of these rules is appropriate. New Zealand residents’ interests in foreign superannuation 2.2 Immigrants to New Zealand and returning New Zealanders often hold investments in foreign superannuation schemes which were acquired while they lived and worked outside New Zealand. The range of retirement savings is extensive and varies from country to country. However, in very general terms, retirement savings can include interests in:  Defined contribution schemes. These are generally where an individual and/or their employer contribute to a superannuation scheme. The amount eventually distributed to the individual represents those contributions plus investment earnings.  Defined benefit schemes. Under these schemes, the amount that is eventually distributed to the individual is pre-determined. An individual may or may not contribute directly to the scheme. If the individual does contribute to the scheme, the amount received does not generally depend on the amount of their contributions. 2.3 In some cases – such as if the foreign government has made contributions to the individual’s investment, or given a tax deduction for contributions that the individual has made to their investment – the individual may not be permitted to access their savings until retirement age. These are called “locked-in” schemes. 2.4 Distributions of retirement savings from a superannuation scheme or another intermediary can take various forms. Generally, these will be as either a periodic pension, a lump sum, or a combination of both. In some cases, a lump sum payment is (or must be) transferred to another superannuation scheme or used to purchase an annuity. 2.5 An individual may also have an entitlement to receive a pension from a foreign Government or a similar statutory body. 2.6 The scope of this review is limited to New Zealand tax-residents who hold interests in defined contribution or defined benefit foreign superannuation schemes. Pensions and lump sums received from a foreign Government would not be covered by the new rules unless the payments arose as a result of services provided by the individual to that government. Furthermore, while New Zealand-residents may also have other overseas investments that they intend to use as retirement savings (for example, shares, bank deposits and real estate), this reform will not change the taxation of those investments. 5 Current taxation of foreign superannuation 2.7 Most countries will tax interests in domestic superannuation schemes at one or more of the following levels:  the contribution to the pension scheme;  investment earnings of the pension scheme; and/or  the pension benefit or payment to the recipient. 2.8 For instance, when a New Zealand-resident has contributed to a New Zealand superannuation scheme (that is, there is no international dimension), New Zealand taxes the retirement savings on a “TTE” basis. This refers to taxing the contributions to the superannuation scheme, taxing the investment earnings of the scheme and exempting the pension benefit or distribution. 2.9 The TTE approach is consistent with the way that other New Zealand-based savings are taxed. For example, an individual who deposits income derived from their employment in a financial institution will have had their employment income taxed, and will be taxed on any interest income that they earn. When they withdraw an amount from their bank account, the withdrawal is not taxed. 2.10 By comparison, a New Zealand-resident with foreign retirement savings has always been taxed under different rules, which may not follow the TTE approach. 2.11 Before 1993, New Zealand taxed pensions or lump sum payments when they were received. In 1993, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules were introduced for all foreign investments, apart from investments in controlled foreign subsidiaries. The primary purpose of these rules was generally to tax interests in foreign investments, including foreign superannuation schemes, on an accrual basis rather than on receipt. This approach to taxation is generally desirable because it ensures that investments in foreign assets are not favourably taxed relative to investments in New Zealand assets. 2.12 As a starting point, the FIF rules applied to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. Tax treatment of foreign superannuation schemes under the FIF rules 2.13 Under the current FIF rules, interests in foreign superannuation schemes are generally taxed using either the fair dividend rate (FDR) method, the cost method, or the comparative value (CV) method. 2.14 The FDR and cost methods tax a deemed 5% return, based either on the market value or the cost of the investment. 1 The CV method taxes the increase or decrease in the value of the investment by taking the difference in value at the start and end of the year. 1 The FDR method generally applies when a market value for the interest is available. The cost method may be used when a market value for the interest is not available. 6 2.15 When an interest in a foreign scheme is a FIF, any actual returns (that is, a pension or lump sum) are exempt from tax. Carve-outs from the FIF rules that apply to foreign superannuation 2.16 Some interests in foreign superannuation schemes can be “carved out” of the FIF rules, meaning they are instead subject to the general taxation rules. The following exemptions from the FIF rules were enacted in response to various concerns. These concerns are, in particular:  Foreign superannuation schemes are often locked-in. This means that the funds generally cannot be withdrawn or otherwise assigned until a specified retirement age. Imposing accrual FIF taxation may create cashflow hardships as the individual’s tax liability would have to be met out of other income.  Investments in foreign superannuation schemes are usually not tax motivated. Instead, they arise because a New Zealand-resident previously lived and worked offshore and established an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme during that period.  Accrual FIF taxation is out of step with how most other countries tax superannuation, which normally occurs on distribution. This creates problems in coordinating the timing of tax payments and foreign tax credits with the treatment in other jurisdictions. 2.17 Locked-in schemes: The main carve-out from the FIF rules that applies specifically to foreign superannuation is for locked-in schemes. This carve- out addresses the major concern that the FIF rules would create cashflow problems for people with such interests. 2.18 New migrants’ four year relief: When the carve-out for locked-in schemes did not apply, a carve-out was previously available to new residents to give them time to adjust to the FIF rules. This meant that a new migrant was not required to comply with the FIF rules for the first four years in which they were resident. The interest became subject to the FIF rules after the end of the four-year period. This carve-out was replaced in 2006 by an exemption for transitional residents. 2.19 Australian superannuation schemes: Interests in some Australian superannuation schemes have also been carved out from the FIF rules. In Australia, it is generally compulsory to make contributions to a superannuation scheme. This carve-out was introduced to address concerns that the FIF rules were difficult to comply with. 2.20 $50,000 minimum threshold: The FIF rules do not apply if an individual’s total FIF interests (that is, their interests in the foreign superannuation scheme and any other foreign interests covered by the FIF rules) are less than $50,000. This carve-out was introduced to reduce compliance costs for people with minimal foreign investments. 7 2.21 Transitional residents’ exemption: The transitional resident rules were introduced in 2006. An individual will generally be a transitional resident if they are a new migrant or have been away from New Zealand for more than 10 years, and do not claim Working for Families tax credits. Transitional residents do not need to account for foreign interests under the FIF rules during approximately the first four years in which they are resident in New Zealand. Further, they do not need to pay tax on most foreign income that they earn in that period. This provides a window in which they are able to transfer their foreign retirement savings to New Zealand tax-free. Taxation of foreign superannuation interests if the FIF rules do not apply 2.22 When an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is carved out from the FIF rules, it is subject to general tax rules – that is, tax on receipt. 2.23 In the case of pension payments, this is a straightforward matter of returning the amount of the pension received and being liable to taxation at an individual’s marginal tax rate. 2.24 In the case of lump sum payments, the tax treatment is more complex and the tax consequences may not be consistent across different people. In some cases, the entire amount of the lump sum payment would be taxable, some cases would involve partial taxation and in other cases the entire amount would be exempt. 2.25 While a transfer to a New Zealand superannuation scheme may not intuitively be considered a receipt of funds, it should be noted that potential taxation also applies when the individual has transferred the lump sum directly to another superannuation scheme. For tax purposes, a transfer is deemed to be a disposal of the individual’s interest in the original superannuation scheme and a purchase of rights in the new superannuation scheme. A transfer to another scheme is therefore a taxable event akin to a withdrawal that is subsequently reinvested. 2.26 The disparity in tax treatment arises because the question of whether the pension or lump sum payment constitutes taxable income depends on which of the “general” tax rules apply. This involves an investigation into the underlying legal structure of the vehicle or arrangement in which the savings are held. For example, if the scheme is structured as a company then the amount received will generally be a dividend and therefore taxable at the individual’s marginal tax rate. To the extent that rules deeming the dividend to be capital (the “available subscribed capital rules”) apply, the amount will not be taxable. 2.27 Moreover, determining the amount to be taxed requires people to not only understand the underlying corporate nature of the scheme, but in some cases to have access to sufficient information about their total capital contributions to the scheme in order to calculate the non-taxable component of the distribution. 8 Interests in foreign life insurance schemes 2.28 Investments in life insurance schemes often have a savings element. In general, tax on foreign life insurance schemes is returned under the CV method. Officials are not aware of concerns regarding the current taxation of foreign life insurance.

Corpus rules may apply in limited circumstances. Pension Lump sum 9 Why review the rules for taxing foreign superannuation? 2.29 Officials are concerned that the current rules for taxing foreign superannuation are complex, inconsistent, and lacking in overall cohesion. 2.30 A key problem is that two different sets of rules (either the FIF rules or the “general” tax rules) potentially apply to an individual’s foreign superannuation interest. This creates a number of difficulties. 2.31 As noted previously, various exemptions from the FIF rules for foreign superannuation were introduced for a number of policy reasons. People with foreign superannuation must determine whether they are exempt from the FIF rules or not, which can be very difficult. 2.32 Applying the FIF rules to foreign superannuation can be problematic. The FIF rules can be complex for people to understand and comply with. The rules apply regardless of whether an individual has received any distributions from the scheme, potentially creating cashflow problems. It can be technically difficult to apply the FIF rules to certain superannuation schemes (such as defined benefit schemes), for which the valuation of the investment for FIF purposes can be uncertain. In addition, accrual taxation is inconsistent with how most other countries tax superannuation, which normally occurs on distribution. This mismatch can create problems in coordinating the timing of tax payments and foreign tax credits with the treatment in other jurisdictions. 2.33 An individual’s overall tax liability can vary significantly based on whether the FIF rules apply or, alternatively, whether the final distribution is taxable under the “general” tax rules. The FIF rules may tax a deemed return on the investment. In contrast, if the final distribution is instead taxable, the entire amount (less capital, when this is allowed) is typically taxable at an individual’s marginal tax rate. The extent to which the amount is taxed will generally depend on the underlying legal structure of the scheme. 2.34 The taxation of lump sum receipts from foreign superannuation interests under the “general” tax rules presents particular difficulties. As mentioned, depending on the legal structure of the scheme and the information available, all of the lump sum could be taxable at an individual’s marginal rate. On the other hand, an individual may have partial or no taxation on the amount of the distribution. 2 Applying these rules imposes high compliance and administrative costs and does not seem to result in fair outcomes across people in similar circumstances. 2.35 To some extent these concerns, particularly the tax treatment of lump sums, have become more pressing over time. In the past, it was either too difficult, too expensive or indeed prohibited under the scheme rules or other countries’ laws to transfer superannuation to New Zealand. Accordingly, at the time the exemptions from the FIF rules were originally introduced, little consideration was paid to the tax treatment of lump sum payments or transfers. 2 In most cases, partial or no taxation can occur only when the interest is in a scheme which is treated as a company or unit trust for New Zealand tax purposes. 10 2.36 Contrary to earlier expectations, there have been significant numbers of lump sum transfers made from foreign superannuation schemes since the exemptions from the FIF rules were introduced. Such transfers were most recently facilitated by the United Kingdom rules for interests in superannuation schemes held by non-residents. In many cases, this effectively meant that the FIF rules applied because, by definition, the schemes are not locked-in. 2.37 As a result, people to whom the FIF rules apply are broadly taxed on the return from the scheme for the years in which they are New Zealand- resident. However, these people have an annual obligation to return income under the FIF rules until such time as a transfer is actually made, which can be problematic from a compliance perspective. 11 CHAPTER 3 Proposed approach for taxing foreign superannuation 3.1 This chapter outlines a proposal for reforming the tax treatment of foreign superannuation. Guiding principles 3.2 Like most countries, New Zealand generally taxes all New Zealand residents on their worldwide income. 3 3.3 This approach helps to ensure that decisions to invest in New Zealand or overseas are not driven by tax considerations. (If income from offshore investments was not taxed in New Zealand, it would create a bias in favour of foreign investment.) Under this approach, people who have migrated to New Zealand should have no preference between bringing their assets to New Zealand or leaving them offshore. 3.4 It is important that the rules are as easy to understand as possible. For many people, their foreign superannuation is their most significant financial asset. It is also likely to be their main or only foreign asset. It is important that the rules that they are required to comply with are not overly complex. Key changes to the taxation of foreign superannuation 3.5 In light of these principles, the key changes to the taxation of foreign superannuation are proposed below. One set of rules for all New Zealand-residents with foreign superannuation 3.6 As a starting point, people with interests in a foreign superannuation scheme would be taxed under one set of rules. This would avoid the complexity and uncertainty associated with determining whether the FIF rules apply or not. It would also help to ensure that there is equivalent tax treatment for all people with foreign superannuation. 3.7 The interests in foreign superannuation schemes to which these proposals apply would be based on the current definition of “foreign superannuation scheme” in the Income Tax Act 2007. This would include most defined contribution schemes and defined benefit schemes set up to provide retirement benefits. 3 It should be noted that New Zealand modifies this approach in certain cases for new migrants – for example, under the transitional resident rules. In those cases, the new migrants are generally not taxed on the transfer of assets they have built up in the country from which they emigrated. 12 3.8 The definition of a “foreign superannuation scheme” is a superannuation scheme constituted outside New Zealand. In this context, a “superannuation scheme” includes:  A trust or unit trust established by its trust deed mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons or paying benefits to superannuation schemes.  A company that is not a unit trust and is established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to members or relatives of members who are natural persons.  An arrangement constituted under the legislation of a country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. Taxing foreign superannuation only on receipt 3.9 It is proposed that the FIF rules would no longer apply to any interests in foreign superannuation schemes. Instead, all income (pensions and lump sum payments) would be taxable only on distribution or receipt. 3.10 As previously noted, the FIF rules can be complex to apply. Retaining the FIF rules would mean the existing problems with the FIF rules would remain, particularly when there is:  a restriction on rights being sold or assigned to another individual or otherwise “locked-in”, which presents cashflow difficulties as the funds cannot be accessed to pay the tax liability;  difficulty in establishing a market value or cost of the superannuation interest, especially for defined benefit schemes; and/or  a mismatch in the timing of taxation between New Zealand and the foreign country, which means that foreign tax is not able to be credited against the corresponding New Zealand tax liability. 3.11 Taxation on receipt would avoid these concerns, and may be generally more appropriate as foreign superannuation is often unable to be accessed until retirement age. 3.12 All amounts from these foreign superannuation interests would be taxable on receipt under the proposed new rules discussed below. Taxation of pension payments on receipt 3.13 Under the proposed approach, foreign-sourced pensions would be taxed when they are received at an individual’s marginal tax rate. This is the way that foreign-sourced pensions from locked-in schemes are taxed currently. New Zealand-residents holding interests in foreign superannuation schemes would be taxed in a similar manner to residents who receive New Zealand Superannuation or foreign social security pensions. Taxation on receipt is simple for people to comply with. 13 3.14 Pensions would be taxed in this way regardless of whether the pension is paid directly by a past employer, or through an intermediary such as a trust, company or unit trust. 4 3.15 The proposal would apply to amounts that would be treated as “pensions” under common law. Taxation of lump sums on receipt based on an inclusion rate 3.16 It is proposed to tax lump sums in a way that broadly approximates the taxation on investment gains that would ordinarily arise had the original lump sum been invested in New Zealand during the period in which the individual was a New Zealand tax-resident. This approach would apply to lump sum withdrawals or transfers to other superannuation schemes. 3.17 Tax on lump sums would be calculated according to an “inclusion rate”. A portion of the lump sum would be included in an individual’s taxable income, according to the rates in paragraph 3.25. The excluded amount would not be taxable. The portion of the lump sum that is taxable would depend on the length of time that elapses between the individual’s migration to New Zealand and the date at which they withdraw or transfer their savings. 3.18 This approach overcomes the concerns and complexity relating to the taxation of lump sums under the “general” rules mentioned in the previous chapter. It also helps to ensures that tax does not create an incentive to leave superannuation in a foreign scheme as long as possible, rather than bringing it to New Zealand to invest or spend. On the contrary, a two-year grace period is proposed to give new migrants an incentive to transfer their funds as soon as possible post-migration. Applying the inclusion rate to lump sums 3.19 The inclusion rate approach would tax the individual’s lump sum to largely the same extent that they would have paid tax on accrual in New Zealand (taking into account the benefit of deferral). After paying tax on the lump sum, the individual should be in approximately the same position as if they had instead transferred the amount on migration and derived taxable interest income in New Zealand. 3.20 This approach aims to ensure that an individual has no preference between bringing their foreign superannuation to New Zealand on the first day that they migrate to New Zealand and paying tax in the interim, or transferring at a later date. The inclusion approach would therefore focus on taxing an amount that takes into account taxable investment gains while the individual is New Zealand-resident and the time value of money (benefit of deferral). Background information about the methodology used to calculate the inclusion rate is included in the annex to this issues paper. 4 Currently, there may be some uncertainty about whether pensions paid by an intermediary such as a trust, company or unit trust would be subject to tax as a pension, or as a distribution under the trust rules or dividend under the company rules (as the case may be). 14 3.21 It should be noted that applying the inclusion rate to lump sum transfers would give a broadly similar tax result to accumulated FIF taxation under the FDR or cost methods. 3.22 The inclusion rate does not explicitly include a deduction for capital. This is because the basic framework for the proposal is to tax an amount that represents the accumulated New Zealand tax that would otherwise have been paid had it been invested in New Zealand. 3.23 These rules would apply regardless of the nature of the underlying legal structure of the superannuation scheme. The trust rules, company rules, and other general provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 would no longer apply to distributions from foreign superannuation schemes. 3.24 To reduce complexity, officials consider that there is a strong case for providing for “brackets” of inclusion rates (rather than requiring people to apply a formula), and for capping the rates at 100%. 3.25 Under this approach, at the time an individual makes a lump sum withdrawal or transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme, they would apply the relevant inclusion rate based on the date they became a New Zealand- resident as follows: Years since migration Inclusion rate 0-2 0% 3-4 15% 5-8 30% 9-12 45% 13-16 60% 17-20 75% 21-24 90% 25+ 100% 3.26 The inclusion rate during the first two years after migration should theoretically be 5%, and during years three and four it should be 15%. However, we propose a short grace period of two years so that migrants who are not transitional residents have a period of time in which they can bring their foreign superannuation to New Zealand with no New Zealand tax consequences. 3.27 When an individual makes a withdrawal or transfer partially in the form of a pension and partially in the form of a lump sum, the respective treatment would apply to each portion. That is, the portion taken as a pension would be taxed under the rules for pensions, and the portion taken as a lump sum would be taxed under the inclusion approach. 15 3.28 When a withdrawal or transfer is from a superannuation scheme in a foreign country that has a double tax agreement with New Zealand, that foreign country is not usually permitted to tax the lump sum. (There are some exceptions to this, such as the 2012 double tax agreement between New Zealand and Canada.) However, when the foreign country can tax the lump sum, New Zealand provides a tax credit for any foreign tax paid on the lump sum when it was distributed. When a New Zealand tax credit is provided, it is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax which is apportioned to the overseas income stream. This policy would remain unchanged under the proposed rules. This means that a tax credit would continue to be available, but only in proportion to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on the lump sum and subject to other relevant limitations. Transitional resident rules and Australian superannuation schemes Transitional resident rules 3.29 The transitional resident rules will be retained. These rules provide that new migrants and certain returning residents are temporarily exempt from New Zealand tax on most foreign income, including foreign superannuation. 3.30 Officials consider that retaining the transitional resident rules would be consistent with the proposed approach outlined above. Transitional residents will continue to be exempt from tax on their foreign pension or lump sum distributions from a foreign superannuation scheme, within approximately the first four years since becoming tax resident. 3.31 People who are not transitional residents would face an inclusion rate of 0% on lump sums withdrawn or transferred within the first two years of becoming a New Zealand tax-resident, and 15% (giving an effective tax rate of around 5%) on lump sums withdrawn or transferred in years three and four. 3.32 After the end of the fourth year and the transitional residents’ exemption, everyone would face the same inclusion rate (30% in years five to eight, which is an effective tax rate of up to 10%) regardless of whether they were previously a transitional resident. Withdrawals and transfers from Australian superannuation schemes 3.33 Double tax agreements generally override domestic tax rules. Under the New Zealand-Australia 2010 double tax agreement, lump sums arising in Australia and paid to a New Zealand-resident under a retirement benefit scheme or in consequence of retirement are not taxable in New Zealand. 3.34 In June 2009, New Zealand and Australia signed a bilateral agreement to enable the trans-Tasman portability of retirement savings. Under this arrangement, people with savings in a qualifying Australian superannuation scheme will be able to transfer their savings to a New Zealand superannuation scheme. The new rules also provide that such transfers will be tax-free. In New Zealand, the rules were legislated for in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. These rules will come into effect up to two months after 16 New Zealand and Australia have exchanged notes informing each other that the necessary legislation has been enacted in both countries. 3.35 The rules described in paragraphs 3.33 and 3.34 would not be affected by the proposals in this issues paper. Contributions made while New Zealand tax-resident 3.36 The proposed rules for taxing foreign superannuation are intended to apply when a New Zealand-resident had contributed to a foreign superannuation scheme prior to becoming a New Zealand-resident. In general, the rules are not intended to apply when the contributions are primarily made while the individual is New Zealand-resident. However, some people may continue contributing to an overseas scheme while in New Zealand because, for example, they are required to under the scheme’s rules. 3.37 The inclusion approach works backwards to presume, on the basis of the assumed interest rate, a particular value of the superannuation interest at the time of migration. Any difference between the transferred amount and the deemed original value are treated as gains. The inclusion approach assumes that contributions made while an individual is a New Zealand-resident are investment gains and effectively taxes them as such. As a result, the amount of the lump sum on which the inclusion rate is applied is too high. An individual’s lump sum withdrawal or transfer could be over-taxed. 3.38 In an extreme example, consider an individual who contributes $1,000 to a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident, and $100,000 while New Zealand-resident. At the time of transfer some years later, he withdraws $150,000 (being $101,000 plus gains). The inclusion rate would apply to the $150,000. The inclusion approach assumes that the increase in value of $149,000 since becoming resident constitutes investment gains and taxes them accordingly. There is no allowance for the $100,000 of New Zealand contributions. 3.39 It is proposed to apply the inclusion rate to the amount of the lump sum after deducting the value of contributions made while New Zealand-resident, as long as those contributions have been subject to New Zealand tax. This would reduce the amount of the lump sum withdrawal on which the inclusion rate is applied by the value of the contributions, thereby reducing the individual’s taxable income. 3.40 A deduction would be allowed only to the extent that contributions are required to be made under the scheme’s rules. When an individual contributes amounts in excess of those required, those amounts would not be deductible from the lump sum withdrawal or transfer. 3.41 If no allowance is given for contributions made while New Zealand-resident, then the individual in the example in paragraph 3.38 would apply the inclusion rate to the full $150,000. If they withdraw the lump sum in year 10, then from paragraph 3.25 a 45% inclusion rate would apply to the lump sum. If the individual has a marginal tax rate of 33%, their tax liability would be $22,275 (being $150,000 x 45% inclusion rate x 33% tax rate). 17 3.42 Under the proposed approach, the individual would apply the inclusion rate to $50,000 (being $150,000 less the $100,000 of New Zealand contributions), rather than the full $150,000. Their tax liability would be $7,425 (being $50,000 x 45% inclusion rate x 33% tax rate) instead of $22,275. Transfers to locked-in New Zealand superannuation schemes 3.43 Some people may wish, or are required, to transfer their foreign superannuation to a New Zealand scheme which has “lock-in” rules (as defined previously). 3.44 The inclusion approach would also apply at the point when retirement savings are transferred to a locked-in superannuation scheme. This means that an individual would have some tax to pay if they do not transfer within the concessionary two-year period or during the exempt period for transitional residents. Applying the inclusion rate to the amount when it is transferred to the superannuation scheme is consistent with the proposed policy outlined above. 5 However, an individual may face cashflow problems if they are unable to access their funds due to the lock-in restrictions. 3.45 Officials invite comment on whether there should be a mechanism that allows tax to be paid out of the transferred amount held in the New Zealand superannuation scheme and, if so, how this should operate. 5 Investment gains on amounts that have been transferred to a New Zealand superannuation scheme are taxed at the level of the scheme under the portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax rules. Once the entire amount (the transferred amount plus any subsequent investment earnings) is distributed from the scheme, it is exempt. 18 Proposed rules for taxing foreign superannuation No tax on foreign income. New Zealand tax resident? Transitional resident? Foreign superannuation? Based on existing “foreign superannuation scheme” definition No Yes Yes No No No tax on foreign income – including transfers – for approximately the first four years of residence. period Other income tax rules apply – e.g. FIF company trust Yes – no tax on accrual Pension Lump sum Fully taxed on receipt. Tax on receipt using the inclusion approach. 19 Examples of the proposed approach for taxing lump sums Example 1 Deirdre works in the United Kingdom for 20 years for the same employer. She starts on a salary of £40,000 which increases by 3% per year over that period. At the end of each year she contributes 9% of her gross salary to her defined contribution superannuation scheme, which accrues interest at an average interest rate of 4%. At the end of 20 years, her superannuation is worth £138,604. She quits her job at the end of the 20 th year and migrates to New Zealand. After the exchange rate conversion, the investment is worth $284,845. Of this amount, $198,732 constitutes contributions and the remainder ($86,113) is investment gains. Deirdre decides not to become a transitional resident for the first four years in which she is a resident New Zealand-resident, as she elects to receive Working for Families tax credits. After four years, Deirdre decides that it would be a good time to withdraw her superannuation savings. At an average interest rate of 4% in the foreign scheme over the four years, the amount has grown to $333,228. This is the value of the lump sum withdrawal to New Zealand. Although Deirdre has made the withdrawal within four years of arriving in New Zealand she is not eligible for the transitional residents’ exemption. The relevant inclusion rate is 15%. For New Zealand tax purposes, $49,984 of the lump sum constitutes taxable income (being 15% of $333,228). Deirdre is currently studying and has no other taxable income. Under the current personal tax rate structure, the tax on her foreign superannuation withdrawal is $8,015. This represents an average tax rate of 2.4% on the $333,228 lump sum. Example 2 Ken from the USA migrates to New Zealand at age 50 and begins work for a new employer. At the time, he has a 401k account worth US$250,000. At age 60 (10 years later) when he contemplates retirement, he decides to make a lump sum withdrawal rather than receive an annuity. The 401k is valued at $407,224 (at an average interest rate of 5% over 10 years). Ken has not been required to pay any tax on earnings on his superannuation interest during the 10 years that he has been resident in New Zealand. After the exchange rate conversion, his superannuation is worth NZ$519,525. The relevant inclusion rate for 10 years is 45%. This means that $233,786 (being 45% of $519,525) would be taxable income in the year of withdrawal. In the year that Ken withdraws his superannuation, he earns more than $70,000 from his employment income, which means that additional income he earns is taxed at the 33% marginal tax rate. His assessable income from his foreign superannuation is therefore taxed at 33%, resulting in a tax liability of $77,149 (being $519,525 x 45% inclusion rate x 33% tax rate). This represents an average tax rate of 14.8% on the $519,525 lump sum. 20 CHAPTER 4 Implementation and transitional issues 4.1 The proposals in this issues paper are expected to be contained in a tax bill scheduled for introduction later this year or towards the middle of next year. Start date for new rules 4.2 As noted above, the complexity of the current rules has contributed to many people not complying with the existing law. Moving from the existing rules to the new rules creates transitional issues, both for people who complied with the existing law – either the FIF rules or the tax rules for lump sums – and for those who have not. 4.3 It is proposed that the new rules apply from the 2011–12 income year. In general, people who receive income from their foreign superannuation scheme (a withdrawal, transfer or pension) on or after 1 April 2011 would be taxed under the new rules. 4.4 However, many people have complied with the FIF rules in the past by filing returns disclosing FIF income. It is not appropriate to require these people to pay additional tax on receipt of the income. Consequently, this paper proposes that those who returned FIF income for the 2010–11 income year by 31 March 2012 can continue to use the FIF rules for future periods (that is, they would be grandparented). The 2010–11 income year is appropriate as it is the most recent year for which all FIF returns must have already been filed. These people would not be taxed under the proposed new rules when they receive a pension or lump sum. 4.5 People who transfer or receive income from their foreign superannuation scheme in the 2011–12 or subsequent income years and who do not meet the conditions in paragraph 4.4 would apply the proposed new rules. They would be taxed on receipt of their lump sum or pension rather than on accrual. Example 3 Jacqui migrated from Canada to New Zealand in 2001 and left her superannuation in the foreign scheme. She is exempt from the FIF rules for the first four years under the new migrants’ exemption, but returns FIF income on her foreign superannuation for subsequent income years. In 2015, she decides to withdraw the whole amount as a lump sum. As she returned FIF income in the 2010–11 income year by 31 March 2012, she can continue to use the FIF rules after 1 April 2011. She is not subject to tax on the lump sum withdrawal in 2015 under the new rules. 21 Application to past lump sum withdrawals or transfers 4.6 In recent years, a number of new tax residents have withdrawn their savings from a foreign superannuation scheme. In many cases, the distribution from the foreign scheme was transferred directly to a locked-in New Zealand superannuation scheme. These distributions are generally subject to tax, and in some instances the New Zealand-resident may have been liable for tax on all or part of the distribution. 4.7 In other cases, however, an individual might have had little or no tax to pay under the existing rules, depending on the underlying legal nature of the foreign superannuation scheme (such as whether it is a unit trust), whether the FIF rules applied, and whether the individual was a transitional resident. 4.8 Some of these people were not aware that they were potentially subject to tax when the foreign scheme distributed their superannuation savings. 4.9 It is important that people comply with their tax obligations under the law that applied at the time. This is to ensure that everyone, including those who paid the appropriate amount of tax, are treated fairly. 4.10 On the other hand, officials recognise that some of the people who withdrew or transferred their savings would not have done so had they been aware of the tax implications. This has largely arisen as a result of the complexity of the rules. 4.11 To ensure that these people are not unfairly disadvantaged, this paper suggests that it would be appropriate to allow people, in limited situations, to apply either:  the law that applied at the time that they withdrew or transferred the savings; or  an inclusion rate of 15%, regardless of the length of time that the individual was resident before the withdrawal or transfer. 4.12 Under the second option, only 15% of the lump sum would be assessable income. The remainder would not be assessable. This would result in an effective tax rate of up to 5% on the lump sum, depending on the individual’s marginal tax rate. 4.13 The choice would be available to people who withdrew foreign superannuation as a lump sum between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011, and who disclose the existence of the transfer to Inland Revenue before 1 April 2014. The requirements for disclosure will be provided once the policy has been finalised. As noted previously, transfers on or after 1 April 2011 would be subject to the new rules, with the relevant inclusion rates in the table in paragraph 3.25. 4.14 No use-of-money interest or shortfall penalties would apply when an individual chooses to pay tax using the 15% inclusion rate. 22 4.15 If an individual chooses to calculate their tax liability under the law that applied at the time they withdrew the savings, and they have a tax liability, penalties and use-of-money interest would apply. However, Inland Revenue will have discretion to write off shortfall penalties for people in these circumstances, as long as an individual has not taken an abusive tax position and has not engaged in evasion or a similar act as part of taking a tax position. These people would not qualify for the grandparenting of the FIF rules as in paragraph 4.4 above. 4.16 The proposal aims to ensure that all people are treated fairly, including those who have paid the appropriate amount of tax, and as well as ensuring that new migrants who may not have been aware of the rules at the time they withdrew their superannuation are not unfairly disadvantaged. Example 4 Robert migrated to New Zealand in 2005 and transferred superannuation worth $90,000 to a New Zealand superannuation scheme in 2007. As he was exempt from the FIF rules under the new migrants’ exemption, he should have paid tax on the transfer but was unaware that tax was due. In 2013, Robert realises that he should have paid tax when he transferred his superannuation. Once the new legislation has been enacted, he tells Inland Revenue of the transfer and chooses to apply the single low inclusion rate to the lump sum amount. He must pay tax on 15% of the $90,000 transfer, which at a marginal rate of 33% results in a tax liability of $4,455. This gives an effective tax rate of just under 5%. Robert would subsequently have no further tax to pay on that transferred amount, although any investment gains in the New Zealand scheme would remain taxable. Past transfers to locked-in New Zealand superannuation schemes 4.17 As noted in paragraph 3.43, some people may have transferred their foreign superannuation to a New Zealand scheme which has “lock-in” rules”. 4.18 If there is a resulting tax liability, the individual may have difficulty paying the tax if they are unable to access their funds due to the lock-in restrictions. 4.19 Officials invite comment on whether there should be a mechanism to allow tax to be paid from the transferred amount held in the New Zealand superannuation scheme and, if so, how this should operate. 23 ANNEX Background on methodology used for inclusion rate Below is background information about the basis on which the inclusion rate approach was calculated. Policy rationale An individual with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme may be able to withdraw an amount from that scheme as a lump sum. If an individual transfers their superannuation to New Zealand at the time that they first become a New Zealand tax-resident, the amount transferred would be in the New Zealand tax base. In general, this amount can be expected to generate a taxable return (such as interest). If an individual does not transfer their savings immediately on migration but instead transfers their savings at a later date, New Zealand foregoes tax on the interest income that the savings would otherwise have accrued. Under the inclusion approach, the lump sum would be taxed to an extent that would roughly equal the amount of tax otherwise payable on New Zealand interest income, after taking into account the benefits of deferral of not having paid that tax on accrual. After paying tax on the lump sum, the individual would be in approximately the same position they would have been in if they instead transferred the amount on migration and derived interest income. The portion of the lump sum to be taxed would primarily depend on the length of time that elapses between the individual’s migration to New Zealand and the date on which they transfer their savings. This is relevant because the longer the delay between migration and transfer, the more tax is foregone on interest income that would otherwise have accrued. Formulae As explained, the desired policy is to tax the lump sum withdrawal or transfer so that the post-tax amount of the lump sum is equal to the amount that an individual would have had if they instead derived interest income in New Zealand and paid tax on accrual. The variables in the following formulae are:  “x” = value of the superannuation interest at the date of migration  “i” = interest rate, which is set at 5%  “t” = tax rate, which is set at 33%  “n” = number of years between migration and the withdrawal or transfer  “b” = necessary inclusion rate to achieve policy intent 24 The value of the amount that would otherwise have been taxed on accrual in New Zealand can be written as: This is the value of the superannuation on the date of migration after accumulating gains for n years at a post-tax interest rate. The value of the amount transferred in a lump sum to New Zealand and taxed on receipt is: In other words, this amount represents the value of the savings at the time of migration, after being left in the foreign scheme to earn i interest for n years. It is then taxed on withdrawal at the end of the n th year. The policy intent is for the value of the first amount to equal the second amount, in order to put the individual in the same position. This gives the following formula: This can be rewritten to find the inclusion rate, as follows: ( ) The inclusion rates depend on three factors:  the interest rate (to which the inclusion rate is sensitive);  the average tax rate (to which the inclusion rate is insensitive); and  the number of years before the withdrawal or transfer that the individual was a New Zealand-resident (to which the inclusion rate is sensitive). The inclusion rates do not depend on the amount of income transferred, or on the value of the foreign superannuation interest at the time of migration (the cost base). The cost base is simply assumed on the basis of the applicable interest rate.

Further, there can be considerable volatility caused by some of the methods mandated for these agreements in Determination G29 that some taxpayers would regard as inappropriate. We accept that these concerns are valid. 1.2 Current tax law requires these agreements when they are in foreign currency to be considered as two separate components. The first component is taxed as a forward contract for foreign exchange (FEC) from the date the agreement is entered into until the date the first rights in the goods pass or the services are performed (the rights date). 1.3 It is this first component that is mainly causing concern. 1.4 The second component, if it exists, is an interest-bearing loan. These loans can result from both prepayments and deferred payments made under these agreements. The proposals in this paper about this component apply to agreements in New Zealand currency as well as foreign currencies. 1.5 This paper briefly outlines the policy settings for the current law and suggests some pragmatic changes to the rules which we consider should remedy these difficulties without introducing inappropriate tax-base effects. The paper is of necessity technical and presumes that readers are familiar with the relevant tax legislation and determinations. Problem and suggested solutions 1.6 Our preferred solutions are:  IFRS GAAP treatment would be mandatory for taxation purposes for IFRS taxpayers. This includes the treatment of any designated hedge, any interest involved, the tax book value of the resultant “underlying” item and the “rights” date. This proposed IFRS GAAP treatment does not extend to any capitalisation of interest into the cost of the underlying item.  For non-IFRS taxpayers, the general rule to value the property or services would be the aggregate of the NZ$ amounts using actual spot rates at payment dates. There would be three exceptions: – for trading stock and consumables, FX amounts from hedges would be included in the value of the stock where they are included in the stock values in the taxpayer’s stock system; 2 – for depreciable property, FX amounts from qualifying hedges would be included in the value of the property; and – interest would only be imputed into the agreements on a future value or discounted value basis in limited circumstances. 1.7 We suggest that the new rules be made effective for the 2011–12 income year for those taxpayers who wish to apply them to new agreements in that year. Otherwise taxpayers will apply the new rules to new agreements from the 2012–13 income year. The choice of application date will apply to all new agreements from the relevant income year. 1.8 We also suggest that the tax treatment for any existing agreements and associated hedges for past years where the methods used are either current or the proposed new alternatives be retrospectively validated. Existing agreements would continue to use those methods until they mature – that is, they will not be allowed to change to another current or new alternative method. 1.9 It is proposed that these agreements be dealt with by the rules included in primary legislation from the time the proposed amendments are made. Following consultation, any changes to the rules will be included in a future tax bill. 1.10 These proposals are detailed in the following chapters. Submissions 1.11 Submissions on this paper should be made by 17 August 2012 and can be addressed to: Financial arrangements C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Financial arrangements” in the subject line. 1.12 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication.

Those making a submission who consider there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 3 CHAPTER 2 The current tax treatment 2.1 The taxation of agreements for the sale and purchase of property and services can be summarised as follows:  The property or services included in the agreement are valued and the difference (if any) between that value and the amounts paid for the property or services are treated as interest to be spread under the accrual rules.  The value of the property or services can be calculated a number of ways: the lowest price that would have been agreed at the contract date for payment in full at the first rights date (usually to possession or income) or when the services are provided; the cash price as per the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 if it applies; the future or discounted value of the payments made; or by a determination made by the Commissioner.  Where the lowest price is expressed in foreign currency, there are a number of exchange rates available which can be used to convert the lowest price to New Zealand currency.  Determination G29 sets out the exchange rates and spreading methods to be used for foreign currency agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services.  Methods A and B in Determination G29 are available for general use and use the forward rate from the contract date to the rights date or final payment date to convert the value of the lowest price in foreign currency to New Zealand currency. The changes in that value due to FX variations until the rights date or final payment date are taxable. The end result for the lowest price is equivalent to the tax treatment of a FEC.  Methods C and D use spot rates at different times and are only available for agreements for trading stock. Method E also uses a spot rate and is available for taxpayers whose gross income does not exceed $2.5 million.  The underlying property or services in the agreement are valued at the lowest price for the other provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 – for example, capitalisation/depreciation of fixed assets, trading stock, sales revenue and revenue account property.  Any FEC used to hedge the cashflows associated with the property or services in an agreement is a separate financial arrangement and dealt with separately under the accrual rules. 4 2.2 Over the past few years some taxpayers and their advisers have raised concerns about the current tax rules for these agreements. These concerns are primarily about the use of Methods A and B in Determination G29 which are difficult to comply with and cause considerable volatility. Some taxpayers have made submissions suggesting alternative methods to the current tax treatment. 2.3 We accept that there are difficulties in applying the legislation for these agreements. 2.4 When agreements are not fully hedged, the use of Methods A and B in Determination G29 can provide very volatile unrealised FX gains and losses for tax at intervening balance dates, as well as recognising items for tax at values which do not represent the cash paid/received under the agreement. 2.5 For example, take the purchase of an asset for US$100 for delivery and payment in full in 12 months’ time which is not hedged with a FEC. Under Determination G29 (Methods A or B), the forward rate from the date the agreement is entered into up to the delivery/payment date is used to measure the value of the asset and any FX gain or loss on the agreement. The forward rate is 0.70 and the spot rate at the date of delivery/payment is 0.80. The asset will be capitalised and depreciated at NZ$143 (US$100@0.70) for tax and the cash paid for the asset is NZ$125 (US$100@0.80). The difference of NZ$18 is taxed as a FX gain on the agreement and is progressively taxed on an unrealised basis when the agreement spans income years. 2.6 Some taxpayers have submitted that, at the least, an expected value approach should be allowed for the FX gains and losses, to reduce volatility caused by taxation of the unrealised FX gains/losses in income years prior to maturity of the agreement. 2.7 Because of the compliance problems, we understand that some taxpayers are attempting to comply with the current rules in alternative ways which give results which approximate the Determination G29 calculations. For example, when payments under an agreement are hedged with FECs, they are returning a corresponding gain/loss on the agreement as is returned on the FECs without necessarily doing the full Determination G29 calculations. 2.8 When alternative compliance techniques are being used there is continuing uncertainty for taxpayers and the potential for disputes. It is good policy to address this situation by providing alternative methods that are easy to comply with. 2.9 We are not aware of any significant difficulties with the use of Methods C, D and E in Determination G29. Methods C and D can be used for appropriate agreements for trading stock irrespective of the use of Methods A and B for agreements for other items. Method E is available for use for agreements for any items, provided the taxpayer’s income does not exceed $2.5 million. 5 2.10 Determination G29 does not currently apply to agreements for services. The changes proposed in this paper should probably be extended to services in an appropriate manner. It is also noted that section EW 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not include services and this appears to be an oversight which should be corrected to be consistent with section EW 32. 6 CHAPTER 3 IFRS GAAP treatment 3.1 The basic IFRS GAAP treatment of an agreement is to record the property or services at the spot exchange rate on the dates that the transactions first qualify for recognition. These dates may coincide with the dates of payments but often do not. 3.2 The rules for the IFRS GAAP recognition of the goods or services in an agreement are generally as follows:  Assets – when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  Liabilities – when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will result from the settlement of a present obligation and the amount at which the settlement will take place can be measured reliably.  Income – when an increase in future economic benefits related to an increase in an asset or a decrease of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. This means, in effect, that recognition of income occurs simultaneously with the recognition of increases in assets or decreases in liabilities.  Expenses – when a decrease in future economic benefits related to a decrease in an asset or an increase of a liability has arisen that can be measured reliably. This means, in effect, that recognition of expenses occurs simultaneously with the recognition of an increase in liabilities or a decrease in assets. 3.3 Where the payment dates do not coincide with the relevant items’ recognition dates there will often be FX gains/losses recognised in the profit and loss account. The FX gains/losses are calculated as the difference between the spot exchange rates on the recognition dates and the payment dates. 3.4 When prepayments, deposits or instalment payments (collectively called prepayments in this paper) are paid/received there can be two treatments. They can be recognised as monetary items at the spot values on the payment dates. They are revalued to spot rates at subsequent reporting dates until the assets/liabilities/revenue items are recognised, with the revaluation gains/losses going to the profit and loss account. The prepayments are included in the value of the relevant items at the spot rates on the dates the items are recognised. 3.5 However, in practice we understand that most of these payments are treated as non-monetary items at historic cost. They are recognised in the items’ values at the spot rates on the prepayments dates – that is, with no subsequent revaluation to spot rates after the dates of the prepayments and no revaluation gains/losses going to the profit and loss account. 7 Hedging FECs – IFRS GAAP treatment Designated cashflow hedges 3.6 When agreements are hedged with FECs which are designated as cashflow hedges for accounting, FX gains/losses on the FECs up to the date of recognition of the hedged items are included in the amounts recorded for those items. These FX gains/losses on the FECs may have been included in an equity reserve (cashflow hedge reserve) prior to the relevant hedged item being recognised. FX gains/losses on the FECs from the recognition date of the items through to the settlement of the FECs are required to be included in the profit and loss account, along with the FX gains/losses for the spot rates mentioned in para 3.3 above. 3.7 When prepayments (both monetary and non-monetary items) are hedged with FECs designated as cashflow hedges, any FX gains/losses on the FECs are included in the values of the prepayments recognised on the balance sheet. The prepayment amounts (revalued to spot rates for monetary items) and the final payment amount (spot or hedged rates) are aggregated and recognised as the IFRS GAAP value of the item (and capitalised if they are a fixed asset). 3.8 The IFRS GAAP recognised values for items that are the subject of these agreements can therefore be a mixture of payments made at spot rates and associated hedging gains/losses up to the recognition dates. They will almost never be the same amounts that are used as the cost (lowest price) for tax purposes for Methods A and B of Determination G29. Designated fair value hedges 3.9 We understand that these agreements are rarely hedged with FECs that are designated as fair value hedges. Where FECs are designated as fair value hedges of these agreements, the gain or loss on the FEC goes to the profit and loss account. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in profit and loss. 3.10 The overall result is that the recognised amount of the hedged item includes gains/losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk – that is, it will be capitalised at the hedged rate to the extent it is hedged. The profit or loss account will include gains and losses on both the FEC and the agreement and will be neutral to the extent that the designated hedge is effective. 3.11 As with designated cashflow hedges, the IFRS GAAP recognised values for items subject to these agreements can be a mixture of spot rates and associated hedging gains/losses. 8 Rolled hedges 3.12 We understand that IFRS GAAP hedging rules allow for hedges to be rolled 1 when payment dates in these agreements are changed. The FX gains/losses on the FECs at the point they are rolled will be retained in the cashflow hedge reserve for designated cashflow hedges and be included in the recognised amount for the hedged item as described above, along with gains/losses on the replacement FEC. Designated fair value FEC hedges which are rolled will be treated similarly and dealt with as described above for designated fair value hedges. Undesignated hedges which are rolled are fair valued at all times through the profit and loss account (including the gain/loss at the point they are rolled) so these are effectively treated as a realisation for accounting purposes. Criteria for IFRS GAAP hedge accounting 3.13 GAAP hedge accounting starts when an item (usually a financial arrangement) is designated as a hedge of another item under GAAP hedging criteria. The hedging criteria are quite strict about what can be designated as a hedge, and designation can only occur on a prospective basis. For FECs, any unrealised FX gains/losses prior to a FEC being designated as a hedge are taken to the profit and loss account and will not be included in amounts subsequently recognised for the hedged item. If a hedge (say FEC) is de- designated as a hedge before it matures, unrealised gains/losses on the hedge for the period it is designated as a hedge are included in the value of the hedged item. Gains/losses on the hedge subsequent to de-designation are included in the profit and loss account and do not affect the value of the hedged item. 3.14 GAAP hedge accounting for these agreements will probably be cashflow hedging and not fair value hedging. However, the result under both types of hedging for the value of the hedged item and amounts in the profit and loss account is likely to be the same. 3.15 Some taxpayers may not take out specific hedges for these agreements because they consider that they are economically hedged in other ways. For example, by projected sales in the relevant foreign currency over the periods of the agreements. They will account for both the sales and the assets resulting from the agreements at spot exchange rates on the dates they settle. 3.16 However, both economically and in cash terms, the taxpayer has effectively fully offset any foreign exchange exposure on the agreements with the receipt of the foreign sales. 1 The FEC is extended beyond its original maturity and any FX gain or loss on the existing FEC at the point it is extended is included in the extended FEC and will be realised at the new maturity date. 9 IFRS GAAP interest amounts 3.17 IFRS GAAP will capture any actual interest in the agreement price by including it in the profit and loss account at the effective interest rate. This approach is used generally for financial arrangements in IFRS GAAP and is acceptable under the IFRS financial reporting method for tax. 3.18 IFRS GAAP may impute interest into deferred property settlements based on the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. It would not usually require the imputation of interest if the amount was immaterial or the period of deferral was less than 12 months. Trading stock 3.19 In some situations (not mass produced/high volume inventory) the GAAP costs in the valuation of trading stock include interest and other costs (such as derivatives hedging amounts) which are considered to be part of the interest costs. 3.20 NZ IAS 39 (para 98) allows foreign exchange hedging gains/losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to be included in the cost of the relevant non-financial asset. This has been a common accounting treatment for many taxpayers both pre- and post-IFRS GAAP. The result is recognition of trading stock at a cost using the FEC hedged exchange rate. Summary of IFRS GAAP accounting 3.21 The following is a high level summary of present IFRS GAAP accounting:  IFRS GAAP generally accounts for these agreements at the spot rate when the underlying item is first recognised.  Where hedging is involved, FX fluctuations on the hedging instrument for the period of the hedge will be included in the IFRS GAAP values recognised for the underlying item. FX variations on the items included in the agreements and any hedging instruments after the recognition of the underlying item generally go through the profit and loss account.  IFRS GAAP designated hedging criteria are reasonably strict and designated hedging can only be done on a prospective basis.  IFRS GAAP will capture any actual and imputed interest for the agreement by including it in the profit and loss account.  Trading stock – both IFRS and pre-IFRS GAAP allow FX gains/losses on associated hedging FECs to be included in the cost of trading stock. 10 Examples of the IFRS GAAP tax treatment of goods included in foreign currency agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services Example 1: Purchase of trading stock This example is based on the following assumptions: The trading stock is purchased within one accounting/income year and is either on hand or not on hand at year-end. The US$ spot rate at settlement is 0.80 and the forward rate to settlement from the contract date is 0.70. The cost of the stock is US$100. A FEC is taken out which is a full hedge of the cost of stock. The IFRS GAAP results are set out for three situations: the hedges are designated as cashflow hedges, the hedges are not designated, and there are no hedges at all. Stock on hand Stock not on hand year-end year-end Year of purchase Designated Not No Designated Not No hedge designated hedge hedge designated hedge Opening stock (say) 0 0 0 0 0 0 Purchases (US$100 @ 0.70/0.80) -143 \* -125 -125 -143 \* -125 -125 Less: Closing stock 143 \* 125 125 0 0 0 Cost of goods sold 0 \* 0 0 -143 \* -125 -125 Sales 0 0 0 200 200 200 COGS 0 0 0 -143 \* -125 -125 FEC gain/loss 0 -18 0 0 -18 0 Gross profit/taxable income 0 -18 0 57 57 75 \*(the designated hedge column effectively includes $18 debit for a FX loss on the hedge in the purchase/value of stock) Following year (where relevant) Sales 200 200 200 0 0 0 COGS -143\* -125 -125 0 0 0 Gross profit/taxable income 57 75 75 0 0 0 Gross profit/taxable income both years 57 57 75 57 57 75 The trading stock is valued at the forward rate in the designated hedge situation and that value will be included in the cost of goods sold in the relevant year when the goods are sold. Where the hedge is undesignated, a timing difference occurs for the $18 between the two years when the stock is on hand at the end of the first year. 11 Example 2: Purchase of a depreciable asset This is a summary of the detailed example set out in the Appendix. The example is based on the following assumptions: The purchase of a depreciable asset for US$100 in 12 months, which is the IFRS GAAP recognition date/tax rights date. The payments are – US$50 in 6 months (payment A, a non-monetary item for IFRS GAAP), and US$50 at the recognition/rights date in 12 months (payment B). Both payments are hedged from the beginning with FECs designated as cashflow hedges. The forward rate for payment A is 0.72 and the forward rate for payment B is 0.65. The spot rate for payment A is 0.65 and the spot rate for payment B is 0.80. The IFRS GAAP results are set out for three situations: the hedges are designated as cashflow hedges, the hedges are not designated, and there are no hedges at all. Designated Not designated No hedges Summary of IFRS GAAP entries Asset 146 DR 139 DR 139 DR Cash 146 CR 146 CR 139 CR P&L 0 7 DR 0 The asset is capitalised at the forward rates via the FECs (in the designated hedge case) or the spot rates (in the other two cases). Where the hedges are not designated there is a difference between the amount capitalised and the cash paid which is reflected in the profit and loss account. This impact will be spread over the term of the agreement depending on the durations of the FECs hedging the payments. The full example in the Appendix includes a balance date 3 months before payment B/the recognition date to demonstrate the effect of cashflow hedging at that point. 12 CHAPTER 4 Policy discussion of FX component 4.1 Current law requires foreign currency agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services to be effectively taxed as two separate components. 4.2 The first component is taxed as a FEC from the date the agreement is entered into until the date the first rights in the goods pass, or the services are performed (the rights date), or the final payment is made. However there is no expected value approach available for these agreements as there is for FECs (as outlined in Determination G14B). As a consequence, the FX component is taxed under Methods A and B of Determination G29 on unrealised gains/losses each year. This can result in volatile taxable income over the term of the agreement. 4.3 Another effect of the FX component tax treatment is that the property or services included in agreements are also taxed, based on values using forward rates. For example, a fixed asset being purchased with an agreement is capitalised and depreciated based on the forward rate, irrespective of whether the agreement is hedged with a separate FEC. Policy rationale and history of current rules 4.4 The background to the current rules is summarised in the statement in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996). A deferred settlement FX ASAP is the economic equivalent of an ASAP denominated in New Zealand dollars plus two separate financial arrangements: • A FEC, in which one party agrees to exchange a foreign currency for New Zealand dollars at a future time. This is for the period between the date of entering into the FX ASAP and date of delivery of the property. • A foreign currency denominated loan for the period between the date of delivery of the property and payment. Therefore, the tax treatment of a FX ASAP should, as far as practical, be consistent with the tax treatment of these other financial arrangements. FX component 4.5 The policy outcome described above was influenced by the court decision in the Dewavrin 2 case. One of its findings was that the changing New Zealand currency value of the property in an agreement should be spread over the term of the contract. 2 CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Ltd (1994) 16NZTC 11,048; (1994) 18 TRNZ509 (CA). 13 4.6 Following this case, the policy for the FX component focussed on the appropriate method to value the property or services in an agreement and how to tax the FX component under the accrual rules. 4.7 It was considered that the spot rate at the rights date accorded with legal precedence, economic theory and commercial practice. At the start of the contract the spot rate on the (future) rights date is not known so the forward rate from the contract date to the rights date was used as the best estimate. The forward rate is consequently used to establish the tax cost/value of the property/services included in the agreement and the amount of any notional loan from the rights date to the settlement date. 4.8 It was also concluded that the FX component was the same in principle as a usual FEC and should be taxed the same way. At that time the taxation of FECs under the accrual rules was essentially on a market/fair value approach and there was no expected value approach available. Discussion of the tax approach of the FX component 4.9 We have considered two aspects of this approach. The first is that there is no expected value method available for spreading the FX gains/losses on the agreements. An expected value method would allow volatility to be removed until any FX gain/loss is realised. FECs have an expected value method applied to them (according to Determination G14B). 4.10 The second aspect is treating the FX component of these agreements as a usual FEC. 4.11 The Determination G29 tax treatment under methods A and B can be demonstrated by the following simplified examples:  Assumptions: – For simplicity there is no agreed/real interest in the purchase price agreed for the property. Therefore there is no loan to be dealt with under some of the provisions in Determination G29. – The possession/rights date for the property is the same as the payment date, again for the sake of simplicity. – A foreign currency agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services is to purchase an asset for US$100 in 12 months. The forward rate at the beginning is 0.70 and the spot rate at delivery is 0.80. The taxpayer does not hedge the purchase with a separate FEC. 14  The tax result is: Capitalise asset at the forward rate (US$100 @ 0.70) = DR Asset NZ$143 Pay cash at spot rate = US$100 @ 0.80 = CR Cash NZ$125 Recognise a one-off FX gain = CR Income NZ$18 4.12 The asset is then depreciated based on the NZ$143 with a one-off taxable gain of NZ$18 on the agreement at maturity per the base price adjustment (BPA) = all consideration received/paid = consideration received being the value of the asset at the forward rate (NZ$143) and consideration paid being the cash at the spot rate (NZ$125). The BPA result could go either way based on the spot rate at delivery compared with the forward rate at the beginning. 4.13 Any separate hedging FEC will be dealt with in its own right and does not affect the taxation of the agreement under Determination G29 (see further comments below about hedging). 4.14 A usual FEC is taxed as follows, assuming the same facts as above, except that the item being purchased is US$100 cash at the forward rate of 0.70: Pay cash at the forward rate = US$100 @ 0.70 = CR Cash NZ$143 Bank US$ at spot rate = USD @ 0.80 = DR Cash NZ$125 Recognise one-off FX loss on FX contract = DR Income NZ$18 4.15 The recognition of the one-off loss for the FEC is based on the value of the US$100 being only NZ$125 at the spot rate at maturity compared with the purchase price of NZ$143. In this case the asset is correctly recognised at the spot rate at delivery (NZ$125 DR to bank account) and if it continued to be held in the form of a US$ deposit it will be revalued periodically at the relevant spot rate. This is an appropriate tax treatment for the purchase of the foreign currency asset. 4.16 For the purchase of an unhedged item the concerns are the use of the forward rate and the compulsory recognition of an FX gain or loss. This is especially the case when IFRS accounting uses the spot rate and accordingly does not recognise any FX component. 4.17 The original policy approach may have been recognising that in many cases taxpayers were hedging these agreements with matching FECs. In such cases the taxpayer would be effectively paying for the asset at the forward rate and it would be appropriate to capitalise and depreciate the asset at that value. However, the agreement is a separate financial arrangement from any hedging FEC and, in principle, its tax treatment should stand alone. (See the discussion below of alternative options to deal with the FX component of these agreements.) 15 4.18 One aspect of the development of the financial arrangements rules is the reluctance to amalgamate the taxation of hedging instruments with the underlying hedged items. However, if a separate FEC is used to fully hedge a foreign currency agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services, the tax position is that the one-off FX gain/loss at maturity of the agreement will be offset by a corresponding one-off FX loss/gain on the FEC. Also, the asset will be capitalised at the forward rate according to Determination G29 which is the amount of cash paid under the hedging FEC to purchase the overseas currency. The overall tax result in this case is an appropriate policy outcome and we note it is the IFRS GAAP designated hedging result. 4.19 While the FX component of these agreements may not be economically equivalent to a usual FEC we consider that they do contain an FX element which has to be dealt with under the financial arrangements tax rules. 4.20 However, chapter 5 discusses some alternative tax treatments of the FX component in certain situations. These alternative treatments are suggested as pragmatic ways of dealing with the difficulties faced by many taxpayers. Agreements for commodities or assets substituted for money 4.21 The current rules tax these types of agreements where applicable through including them in the definitions of “forward contract” and “future contract”. This is appropriate and in accordance with the original policy intent. There are no changes suggested to the current treatment of these financial arrangements. 16 CHAPTER 5 Alternative treatments for the FX component 5.1 Pragmatic alternative tax treatments of the FX component are discussed in this chapter as follows:  For IFRS taxpayers the IFRS GAAP treatment as described earlier would be the tax treatment. This would include relevant FX amounts for designated FEC hedges which are included in the IFRS GAAP values of goods or services. However, the IFRS GAAP treatment would not be available for FX amounts for designated FEC hedges included in the IFRS GAAP amounts recognised for capital goods or services, except to the extent the assets are depreciable. In these cases the FEC hedges would continue to be taxed as separate financial arrangements.  For non-IFRS taxpayers the general rule to value the property or services would be the spot rates at the payment dates. There would be two exceptions, the first being for trading stock which would allow FX amounts from hedges to be included in the value of stock when these are included in the stock values in the taxpayer’s stock system. The second is for depreciable property where FX amounts from qualifying hedges would be included in the value of the property. Discussing the alternatives IFRS taxpayers 5.2 The IFRS GAAP treatment as described above would be compulsory for tax for IFRS taxpayers. This treatment would include FX amounts for designated FEC hedges in the values of goods or services. This treatment of the hedging FEC coincides with the current Determination G29 (methods A and B) treatment of the FX component at the forward rate and is compliance- friendly. This treatment is appropriate for a hedged agreement. 5.3 Compared with the status quo, the inclusion of FEC hedging amounts in the value of goods or services in agreements is a compliance concessionary treatment. These amounts would otherwise be taxable at maturity of a FEC and including them in the value of goods or services per IFRS GAAP is a timing issue which merely re-spreads these amounts for tax. The re- spreading is considered acceptable as over time the gains and losses being spread should even out. It is also noted that it is hard to forecast at any time whether there will be FX gains or losses on FECs. This treatment will also apply to amounts included in the cashflow hedge reserve and subsequently the value of the underlying item for designated hedges which are rolled. Undesignated rolled hedges would continue to have a base price adjustment (BPA) applied to them for tax at that point. 17 5.4 Hedging FEC gains/losses included in the value of goods and services will need to be excluded from consideration for the purposes of the BPA, and possibly for spreading purposes as well. 5.5 We consider that this option should not be available for a FEC hedging non- taxable/capital goods or services, except for assets which are tax depreciable. The hedging FECs in these cases would continue to be taxed as stand-alone financial arrangements. It may also be necessary to include recapture rules for hedging amounts included in the cost of depreciable items which are subsequently disposed of at an amount in excess of cost (discussed in “potential permanent differences” below). 5.6 We suggest that it be mandatory for IFRS taxpayers to follow the IFRS GAAP treatment in all cases where the IFRS GAAP is the basis for financial reporting. This is effectively the modified fair value method. There are two main reasons for this suggestion. The first is that it is the most compliance- friendly approach for these taxpayers because it follows the profit and loss account result of the agreements and any designated hedges. Secondly, there is a concern that allowing IFRS taxpayers to use an alternative expected value approach for these agreements may provide a significant fiscal risk, where they can result in leaseback transactions (as discussed below). Tax rules and GAAP 5.7 Previous working groups have reported on various aspects of the alignment of the accounting and tax treatments of financial arrangements. The 1990 tax simplification report made the following comment: Wherever possible, the accruals determinations should be aligned to the New Zealand Society of Accountants’ statements of standard accounting practice (SSAPs). 5.8 Including hedging foreign exchange gains/losses with income/expenditure on the underlying hedged item for tax purposes has been considered by various working groups in the past, especially the Valabh Committee in its 1991 report. One aspect considered by that committee was the treatment of hedging foreign exchange instruments, primarily financial arrangements. It concluded that the two arrangements should continue to be taxed separately. The conclusion was influenced by the difficulties of identifying which hedges were for particular underlying transactions and policy concerns about FX hedging gains/losses for non-taxable hedged items. 5.9 We note that the IFRS GAAP rules for designated hedging mean it is easier to identify which financial arrangements are being used to hedge particular FX exposures. However, there are situations when taxpayers choose not to adopt designated hedging for accounting when they are economically hedged. In these situations it will be difficult for tax purposes to consider allowing hedging gains/losses to be included in the taxation of underlying items such as fixed assets and trading stock. As discussed in the 1991 report, there is no ability to allow hedging gains/losses on financial arrangements to be included in items that are not taxable, such as non-depreciable capital account items, for example. 18 5.10 We acknowledge that the tax rules do follow the accounting treatment in some areas. These include financial arrangements where the financial accounting treatment is an alternative spreading method available to many taxpayers. It also applies generally to the valuation of trading stock. 5.11 Further, IFRS tax spreading methods follow IFRS GAAP hedging to an extent. The modified fair value method excludes some amounts recognised in equity reserves in years prior to the BPA. The amounts in equity reserves mostly arise from cashflow hedge accounting. Trading stock 5.12 Many agreements are for trading stock and the tax treatment of trading stock is generally based on GAAP costs/valuations. This is acceptable tax policy. Summary of any IFRS GAAP tax treatment of foreign currency agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services and associated FEC hedges 5.13 The following table summarises how the suggested IFRS GAAP (GAAP in the table) tax treatment would apply: GAAP Treatment FX agreement FEC No FEC Capitalise at spot rate = GAAP, with any GAAP loan interest & FX gains/losses taxed in profit and loss account. N/A FEC not designated as a hedge Capitalise at spot rate = GAAP, with any GAAP loan interest & FX gains/losses taxed in profit and loss account. GAAP profit and loss account includes all fair value gains/losses on FEC. Use IFRS financial reporting method (fair value). OR G14B (expected value). FEC designated as cashflow hedge Capitalise at FEC hedged amount = GAAP, with any GAAP loan interest & FX gains/losses taxed in profit and loss account. Fair value gains/losses on FEC in cash flow hedge reserve. Use modified fair value (mandatory) as the hedge is locked into the agreement for tax accounting. FEC designated as fair value hedge (unlikely) Capitalise at hedged amount per fair value hedging = GAAP \* with any GAAP loan interest & FX gains/losses taxed in profit and loss account. \* Capitalisation includes any FX amounts attributable to the hedged risk on firm commitments recognised in the balance sheet as DRs/CRs under fair value hedging prior to recognition of the underlying item. Those same amounts (in reverse) have been included in the profit and loss account under fair value hedging. GAAP profit and loss account includes all fair value gains/losses on FEC. Use modified fair value (mandatory) as the hedge is locked in to the agreement for tax accounting. 19 Non-IFRS taxpayers 5.14 It is suggested that non-IFRS taxpayers aggregate the NZ$ amounts of the payments made at the spot rates at the various payment dates for valuing the goods and services under the agreements. This would be the general rule for non-IFRS taxpayers, with two exceptions:  Trading stock – Where a taxpayer’s trading stock system includes FX amounts from FEC hedges in its cost and value for trading stock, that treatment would be followed for tax.  Depreciable assets – A taxpayer would include FX amounts from qualifying FEC hedges in the cost of the assets for tax purposes and those amounts would be excluded from being taxed for the FEC. 5.15 Qualifying FEC hedges – The criteria for qualifying FEC hedges would be strict to prevent inappropriate risks to the tax base. Only over-the-counter FECs with recognised or approved financial institutions in New Zealand would be qualifying hedges. There will probably be other necessary requirements regarding documentation and perhaps elections to evidence the hedges. It is assumed that most non-IFRS taxpayers with these agreements are only using FECs to hedge them and do not have FECs for other purposes. Otherwise, it may be difficult to allow this treatment where the use of FECs is not restricted to hedging. We are not yet convinced that this suggestion can be legislated and complied with in an appropriate manner. Submissions are specifically requested on this. 5.16 Transitional matters – See the comments at the end of this chapter for the suggested general transitional measures that would apply to both IFRS and non-IFRS taxpayers. Other matters related to the suggested alternatives Consistency/anti-arbitrage 5.17 The consistency/anti-arbitrage rules will not need to be amended if the IFRS GAAP treatment is compulsory for these agreements for IFRS taxpayers. 5.18 There may be concern that the IFRS GAAP hedging rules may provide opportunities for taxpayers to declare or not declare FEC hedges of agreements to get the best tax result. The IFRS hedging criteria are quite strict about what can be designated as a hedge and when hedging starts and stops. For FECs, any unrealised FX gains/losses prior to a FEC being designated as a hedge are taken to the profit and loss account and will not be included in amounts subsequently recognised for the hedged item. If a hedge (say FEC) is de-designated as a hedge before it matures, unrealised gains/losses on the hedge up to the point it is de-designated are subsequently included in the value of the hedged item. Gains/losses on the hedge subsequent to de-designation are included in the profit and loss account and do not affect the value of the hedged item. 20 5.19 These hedging rules should mean that the risk of manipulation of hedging for tax purposes is small. For FEC hedges, FX gains/losses on the FEC prior to designation and after de-designation are taken to the profit and loss account and will be taxable at that point. They are not included in the values of the goods/services on a retrospective basis so that there is no ability for taxpayers to retrospectively decide to include/not include amounts related to FEC hedges in the values for goods or services. It is only the FEC gains/losses during the period of hedge designation which are included in the IFRS GAAP values of the goods or services. 5.20 For non-IFRS taxpayers, the suggested changes outlined above are a significant departure from the current tax treatments of both the hedged item and the FEC hedges, and therefore may carry significant risk for the revenue base. Consequently, it will be necessary to have robust criteria for the qualifying hedges and for the consistent use of the tax treatment for all FEC hedges of trading stock and depreciable assets during an income year and from year-to-year. IFRS recognition date and the tax rights date 5.21 The IFRS GAAP recognition rules would generally coincide with the rights dates for possession and dates for provision of services which are used for tax. At the very least they will be reasonably approximate to those dates and there is only a small risk of significant timing mismatches between the two. We consider that using the GAAP recognition concepts for goods and services included in these agreements is acceptable for tax purposes. Potential permanent differences 5.22 Including FX gains/losses on these agreements in the value of assets by using IFRS GAAP rather than taxing them separately under the current rules has the potential to create significant permanent differences. These will occur when depreciable assets are sold in excess of their cost and the resulting (net) gains are not subject to tax. It is noted that the FX amounts included in the cost of the assets could be either gains or losses and that a taxpayer will have to apply the same treatment to all these agreements. 5.23 These factors will tend to negate the impact of the non-taxation of FEC gains/losses over time and make it less of a concern. However, we are considering if it is necessary to include recapture provisions for any FEC gains/losses included in the cost of these items. Submissions are specifically requested on this. Sale/leaseback transactions 5.24 We are aware that some assets subject to these agreements become sale/leaseback transactions at the point of delivery of the goods/assets. Under the current tax treatment, the ability to make some agreements sale/leaseback transactions while making others direct purchases (without a sale/leaseback) can result in risks to the tax base. 21 5.25 The Determination G29 treatment of an unhedged foreign currency agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services which is assigned to a financier just prior to the delivery of the goods would give a net nil tax result for the assignor (the original purchase party to the agreement). The current Determination G29 treatment (without an expected value alternative) would create unrealised FX gains/losses in the years prior to the BPA. When the agreement is assigned to a third party lessor under a sale/leaseback transaction, a BPA is required for the agreement. 5.26 The consideration received for the assignment of the agreement will be the value of removal of the assignor’s obligation to purchase the goods. This will be the value of the goods at the spot rate at that time. The consideration paid for the assignment will be the loss of the right to receive the goods which will also be valued at the spot rate at that time. These two amounts will net to zero in the BPA. Any income/expenditure in prior years will be reversed by the BPA to give an overall net nil result for tax for all years. 5.27 The overall result on assignment of the agreement for the assignor is no taxable income/deductions. If the goods were depreciable assets it would capitalise them at the spot rate on delivery under the leaseback transaction (a finance lease for tax). 5.28 This situation could be managed to produce the most advantageous result for the taxpayer. Where the maturity of an agreement was to produce taxable income as a result of the final “a – b” calculations of methods A and B, the agreement could be assigned. A sale/leaseback transaction would be put in its place and this would give the net nil result outlined above. Where the agreement “a – b” calculations produced an overall net loss, the agreement would not be assigned. The asset would be capitalised at the forward rate and the FX loss taken for tax. 5.29 The unrealised gains/losses under the “a – b” calculations would be taxable in the years before the BPA but the choice to assign and enter into a sale/leaseback may still be advantageous. If an expected value alternative was provided for and used by a taxpayer, there would be no “a – b” FX gains/losses in the years before the BPA. In this case the choice to assign would be even more appealing in many cases, where there is an overall gain on the agreement. 5.30 The IFRS GAAP treatment may not provide the same opportunity for these agreements. It would probably deal with both the sale/leaseback transaction and the outright purchase at the spot rates on delivery. For a hedged agreement it would probably deal with both transactions at the hedged rate. We are continuing our analysis of the IFRS GAAP treatment of this matter to confirm there are no revenue base concerns. Transitional issues 5.31 Because of the widespread compliance difficulties with the existing rules referred to earlier, it will be necessary to provide appropriate transitional provisions for existing agreements and any new alternatives provided. 22 5.32 We suggest that agreements in place at the time of any amending legislation using methods which are either existing or suggested new alternatives provided in amended legislation be retrospectively validated to prevent any disputes over past returns. There will be no ability to change the methods used for agreements and any FEC hedges in past returns when the returns have been filed under the conditions outlined above. 5.33 New alternative methods provided in any amending legislation would only be applied to new agreements entered into from the date of amending legislation. 5.34 We specifically request submissions on this suggestion. 23 CHAPTER 6 Default future value and discounted value interest calculations 6.1 As previously discussed (see chapter 4), the tax rules require foreign currency agreements for the sale and purchase of property to be effectively taxed as two separate components. 6.2 The second component of an agreement can be an interest-bearing loan in foreign currency (an FX loan). These loans can result from both prepayments and deferred payments made under agreements. The loan value is identified primarily by one of two methods. The original method is essentially the difference between the cash payments and the lowest price that would have been agreed at the time the agreement is entered into for full payment at the rights date. It was originally aimed at deferred payment situations. The second method is the difference between the future or discounted values of the payments before or after the rights date and the present value of those payments at the rights date. Any FX loans are now taxed under Determination G9C, which is an expected value method. 6.3 The calculation of interest under the first method is appropriate when the parties have agreed on a lowest price applicable at the rights date. 6.4 Section EW 32(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 is the relevant legislation: Future or discounted value (5) The value of the property or services is the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, of the amounts paid or payable on the date on which the first right in the property is transferred or the services are provided, as determined by the Commissioner under a determination under section 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 6.5 The future or discounted value (FV/DV) approach is the third alternative in section EW 32 for determining the relevant values. However, if neither of the first two alternatives applies, the FV/DV method automatically applies. This means that in many cases either Inland Revenue or taxpayers are able to impute a loan and interest into agreements irrespective of whether the parties have negotiated or agreed an interest component. 6.6 The discussion which follows applies to both foreign currency and New Zealand currency agreements. Policy rationale and history of the current law 6.7 The background to the current law is summarised in the statement in the Taxation Information Bulletin, Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) outlined in chapter 3. 24 The FX loan component 6.8 The inclusion of any loan component in agreements is an inherent part of the policy purposes in the original accrual rules and is not disputed. The loan component was included in the policy makeup to apply when the parties include interest in the payments. The original policy discussion implies that any interest will apply when there are deferred payments (after the rights date). FV/DV calculation of the value of property or services 6.9 When the tax treatment of these agreements was examined by the property consultative group 3 in 1988, its conclusions emphasised that tax law should not impute/force interest into agreements where the parties did not contemplate there was any interest. The group noted that this was also the original policy outlined in the 1987 report of the consultative committee on the accrual rules. The group did acknowledge that any prepayments or deferral of payments would usually have a time value-of-money aspect. However, it emphasised that it was not up to tax law to force the recognition of interest if the parties considered there was no loan/interest in the agreements. 6.10 Despite this, a “back-up” alternative to calculate the value of the property in an agreement was provided, being the discounted value of amounts paid for the property in a determination made by the Commissioner. This may have been in response to a concern that there had to be a mechanism for interest to be recognised for tax when it had been hidden in the payments by the parties. 6.11 In 1999, the discounting alternative was enhanced to allow future valuing of payments made before the rights date so that the value could be calculated by using either the DV or FV methods, or a combination of both. The motivation for the change was the absence of a FV method to deal with prepayments when there was no agreed lowest price. It does not appear that there was a re-examination of the overall policy framework about the FV/DV alternative at that time. 6.12 The result is that the DV or FV method of calculating the value of property can be used when there is no lowest price agreed between the parties or they simply do not address it. The latter is very likely when non-residents are a party to the agreement and have no interest or knowledge of New Zealand tax matters. 6.13 A taxpayer may be able to choose to use the DV/FV alternative to get the best tax result for the agreement. When a foreign supplier is involved and there is a deferral of payment, the DV method could be used to always impute interest into an agreement. This situation is likely to be very common and could apply to any agreement for a term greater than 93 days, with those less than 93 days being excepted financial arrangements. Given that New Zealand is a net importer of capital equipment, the imputation of interest in these agreements is likely to work against the revenue base. For trading stock and services this is of less concern because of the short-term nature of the relevant agreements. 3 Report of Consultants on the Effect of the Accruals Regime on Property Transactions 1988 25 6.14 In reverse, Inland Revenue could attempt to impose interest on a DV/FV basis on any or all agreements over 93 days if it considered there was no agreed lowest price. 6.15 It is unclear how the policy development over the years has resulted in the current default approach being FV/DV in all cases. However, it appears that the current position goes beyond the original policy intent. 6.16 In its support is the concept that inherently there is a time value-of-money in all prepayments and deferred payments under these agreements. As well, the second alternative in the hierarchy of methods to value property or services in an agreement is the cash price if the agreement is a credit contract. That implies that payments in excess of the cash price are interest for tax in those cases. 6.17 It is also noted that IFRS GAAP will probably impute interest on a DV basis into long-term and large monetary liabilities resulting from these agreements in some circumstances when there are deferred payments. 6.18 We suggest that it is not appropriate that this method be potentially available for all agreements with a term greater than 93 days which are not for trading stock and where there is no recognition of interest in the agreement by the parties. If it were removed both Inland Revenue and taxpayers would not be able to impute interest into agreements on this basis. How have overseas jurisdictions dealt with the FV/DV issue? 6.19 The tax treatment of deposits/prepayments and deferred payments in various overseas tax jurisdictions is illustrated in the following table and based on the following assumptions/facts:  an agreement for purchase of equipment for $1,000 for delivery 12 months from the contract date;  various alternatives ((a) to (e) below) for payment of the $1,000; and  there is no “agreed lowest price” for New Zealand tax purposes which means either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer have the ability to impute interest into the contract on a FV/DV basis. 26 6.20 The table describes if there is a loan/s and interest for tax purposes in the five jurisdictions. IFRS GAAP treatment is essentially the UK tax treatment. a. b. c. d. e. New Zealand Yes No Yes Yes Yes UK No No No Yes No Australia No No No No No USA No No No Yes No Canada No No No Maybe No a. Pay in full at contract date b. Pay in full at rights date c. Payment deferred to 1 month after rights date d. Payment deferred to 12 months after rights date e. Progress payments up to and including rights date 6.21 New Zealand appears to be out of step with the other jurisdictions for scenarios (a), (c) and (e). Scenario (d) (payment deferred for 12 months (or longer)) seems to be in step with the other jurisdictions. The IFRS GAAP treatment will probably include interest on an effective interest basis in the case of scenario (d). Suggested alternative treatments for the default FV/DV of payments approach to calculate the loan and interest components 6.22 We suggest the following options to deal with this:  Eliminate the ability to use FV/DV altogether as an alternative available to impute interest into an agreement. This option would remove the ability of both taxpayers and Inland Revenue to impute interest into agreements. Interest would only be included in agreements if the parties explicitly identified the interest component in the agreement. However, this is not our preferred option.  Follow the IFRS GAAP treatment for agreements which may include the discounted value treatment of the amounts paid for the property/services in some cases when payments are deferred. This option would apply if the IFRS GAAP treatment of agreements is allowed for tax. 27 This option would retain the discounted value treatment of loans and interest to the extent it was performed for IFRS GAAP purposes. However, it would eliminate the ability of both Inland Revenue and taxpayers to impute interest into any or all agreements. This outcome would still be consistent with the original policy intentions and be compliance-friendly.  For non-IFRS taxpayers, modify the existing FV/DV rules to apply only in certain circumstances. For example, they would apply to significant prepayments for property which was in a substantially completed state or for services yet to be performed more than 12 months before the rights date, and to deferred payments made more than 12 months after the rights date. This treatment would be in line with the suggested treatment for IFRS taxpayers and significantly reduce the imputation of interest into agreements when it is not appropriate. 28 APPENDIX Example: IFRS GAAP treatment of the purchase of a depreciable asset The example is based on the following assumptions: The purchase of a depreciable asset for US$100 in 12 months, which is the IFRS GAAP recognition date/tax rights date. The payments are – US$50 in 6 months (payment A, a non-monetary item for IFRS GAAP), and US$50 at the recognition/rights date in 12 months (payment B). Both payments are hedged from the beginning with FECs designated as cashflow hedges. The forward rate for payment A is 0.72 and the forward rate for payment B is 0.65. The spot rate for payment A is 0.65 and the spot rate for payment B is 0.80. A balance date falls three months prior to the recognition/rights date when the spot rate is 0.75. The IFRS GAAP results are set out for three situations: the hedges are designated as cashflow hedges, the hedges are not designated, and there are no hedges at all. Designated Not designated No hedges P&L B/S P&L B/S P&L B/S Contract date 0 0 0 0 0 0 Payment A date Cash (FEC or spot) 0 69 CR 69 CR 77 CR Prepayment (non-monetary) 0 69 DR 77 DR 77 DR P&L 8 CR Balance date Payment B FEC FV to CFHR 0 11 Dr FEC Derivative 0 11 CR 11 DR 11 CR Subtotal for 1 st year 0 0 3 DR 3 CR 0 0 Payment B: Rights date Payment B to asset 0 77 DR 15 DR 62 DR 62 DR Cash (FEC or spot) 0 77 CR 77 CR 62 CR Reverse CFHR 0 11 CR Reverse FEC derivative 0 11 DR 11 CR 11 DR Reverse prepayment 69 CR 77 CR 77 CR Prepayment to asset 69 DR 77 DR 77 DR Subtotal for 2nd year 0 0 4 DR 4 CR 0 0 Summary of GAAP entries Asset 146 DR 139 DR 139 DR Cash 146 CR 146 CR 139 CR P&L 0 7 DR 0 The asset is capitalised at the forward rates via the FECs (in the designated hedge case) or the spot rates (in the other two cases). Where the hedges are not designated there is a difference between the amount capitalised and the cash paid which is reflected in the P&L. This P&L impact will be spread between income years over the term of the agreement depending on the terms of the FECs hedging the payments.

The matters raised do not give rise to significant policy questions, but are questions that require clarification or amendment to the legislation to ensure it operates as intended. 1 1.2 The issues covered are:  application of the hire-purchase time-of-supply rule to land transactions;  treatment of directors’ fees;  consequential and remedial amendments following the introduction of the apportionment rules;  consequential and remedial amendments following the introduction of the zero- rating for land rules;  consequential and remedial amendments following the changes to the definitions of ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖;  credit notes when GST is mistakenly accounted for. 1.3 Subject to consultation, we plan to recommend to Government that the issues be included in the first available tax bill in 2013. 1.4 Your comments on the solutions suggested in this paper are welcomed. In order to include any amendments in the first tax bill of 2013, we would appreciate your submissions by 1 March 2013. Submissions can be addressed to: GST issues C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.5 Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with ―GST issues‖ in the subject line. 1.6 Responses to this paper may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of responses on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you consider that any part of your letter should properly be withheld under the Act please clearly indicate this. 1 All legislative references in this paper are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. 2 CHAPTER 2 Hire purchase time of supply rule and land transactions Scope of the “hire purchase agreement” 2.1 There is currently some uncertainty over the scope of the term ―hire purchase agreement‖ used in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act), specifically over whether an agreement for the sale of land on deferred terms can be a hire purchase agreement. 2.2 A hire purchase agreement is a contract in which a purchaser pays for goods, in parts, over a period of time. The Income Tax Act defines a ―hire purchase asset‖ as ―personal property which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement‖. 2 This is consistent with the now repealed Hire Purchase Act, which did not include real property (i.e. land) in the scope of ―goods‖. For the purposes of the Income Tax Act, a sale of land on deferred terms is therefore not capable of being a hire purchase agreement. 2.3 The GST Act does not contain a separate definition of a ―hire purchase agreement‖, but since 1 April 2005 has referred to the definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Before that, the GST Act referred instead to a definition in the Hire Purchase Act 1971. 2.4 The GST Act treats the time of supply for ―goods and services which are supplied under a hire purchase agreement‖ to be the time the agreement is entered into. The word ―goods‖ has a broad definition in the GST Act and includes real property. 2.5 The question of whether real property can be the subject of a hire purchase agreement therefore differs in the Income Tax Act and the GST Act. 2.6 When the GST Act was changed to use the Income Tax Act definition of a hire purchase agreement, rather than the Hire Purchase Act, it was not intended to widen the scope of hire purchase agreements to include land for GST purposes. Suggested solution 2.7 We consider that the definition of ―hire purchase‖ agreement in section 2(1) of the GST Act should be amended to clarify that, to avoid any doubt, land is specifically excluded from the scope of hire purchase agreements. This will ensure that a sale of land on deferred terms is not a hire purchase agreement for the purposes of the GST Act, and the use of the term is therefore consistent between the GST and Income Tax Acts. 2 Section YA 1, Income Tax Act 2007. 3 Timing advantages 2.8 Providing that land cannot be the subject of hire purchase agreements for GST purposes, providers of some long-term sale and purchase agreements for land could enjoy a GST timing advantage. This situation would arise if an up-front tax deduction for GST were claimed for the purchase of land, but the corresponding output tax were able to be paid in the distant future, resulting in a timing advantage. The example below describes this. Example A mortgage provider (sometimes referred to as a ―wrap mortgage provider‖) provides a property to a purchaser but retains the title to the property until the purchaser completes the required payments. Ultimate settlement can sometimes occur up to 30 years after the date of the initial agreement. The transaction is arguably a ―hire purchase agreement‖, under which the mortgage provider would be required to account for the full amount of output tax on the date the agreement was entered into. If this was not a hire purchase agreement, the mortgage provider could claim a full input tax deduction on the date of the initial agreement to purchase the property. However, the mortgage provider would not be required to account for the full amount of the corresponding output tax until the date of settlement although GST will be returned on payments made before the date of settlement. 2.9 Section 19D of the GST Act was intended to prevent timing advantages on significant deferred settlement transactions, particularly involving vendors on the payments basis and purchasers on the invoice accounting basis. Section 19D achieves this by requiring the supplier of goods sold for a consideration of more than $225,000 to account for GST on an invoice basis. 2.10 The section also prevents people from avoiding the provision by splitting up the supply so that each supply falls below the $225,000 threshold. In these cases, the Commissioner may treat the supply as having been made for consideration of more than $225,000 if the Commissioner believes that the person made more than one supply to avoid the application of section 19D. 2.11 However, since mortgage providers may have legitimate commercial reasons for splitting transactions into more than one supply or the value of the mortgages falls below $225,000, this subsection may not apply. Suggested solution 2.12 It is suggested that section 19D of the GST Act be amended so that where transactions involve the deferred settlement of land and periodic payments, the registered supplier will be required to account for GST on the supply at the time the agreement is entered into, rather than periodically. This achieves a similar outcome as hire purchase agreements but in a more appropriate context. 4 Scope of definition 2.13 There is also a separate concern with the scope of the definition of ―hire purchase agreement‖ in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 It is arguable that this definition does not adequately cover agreements with an option to purchase. 2.14 As discussed previously, the definition of ―hire purchase agreement‖ originates from the Hire Purchase Act 1971 and is intended to cover two types of agreement. The first is one where the goods are let or hired to a person with an option to purchase (the ―option to purchase agreement‖). The second is when a person has agreed to purchase the goods with a condition (a ―conditional contract of sale‖). The main difference between the two is whether the person has agreed to purchase the goods at the time the relevant contract is entered into. 2.15 The rewrite of the hire purchase agreement definition contained a drafting error, which arguably means the person’s upfront agreement to purchase the goods is also required in order for the arrangement to be an option to purchase agreement. This interpretation is inconsistent with the policy intent behind the definition, which (as stated) is to capture both forms of agreement. Suggested solution 2.16 The definition should be clarified to achieve the policy intent, so that paragraph (a)(i) explicitly incorporates contracts when the person has an option to purchase, but that option is not exercised until a later date. Suggested application date 2.17 We consider that the amendment suggested above (concerning the scope of the definition) should apply from 1 April 2005, as this was the date that the GST Act adopted the Income Tax Act definition of ―hire purchase agreement‖. 2.18 In our view this application date should apply universally. This is because the definition of ―hire purchase agreement‖ arguably does not include ―option to purchase agreements‖ and is:  contrary to the former Hire Purchase Act; and  contrary to the position adopted by many taxpayers, on the basis of a clearly understood policy. 2.19 However, we are aware that some taxpayers have adopted the opposite position. To allow disputes on the existing wording to run their course, we suggest a ―savings‖ provision for taxpayers that have filed returns on a contrary basis. 3 Section YA (1) and, before that, section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004. 5 CHAPTER 3 GST treatment of directors’ fees 3.1 The GST Act provides that a person engaged as a director is not carrying on a taxable activity. This rule is designed to keep directors out of the GST net, unless their activities as a director are performed as part of a broader taxable activity, in which case their directorship will form part of that activity. 3.2 Inland Revenue has issued a Public Ruling on the tax treatment of payments to directors (BR Pub 05/13). The Ruling largely achieves an outcome that reflects the policy intent of the provisions: directors that are not carrying on a taxable activity are not generally required to charge GST for their services. 3.3 When GST is charged, the paying company will generally be entitled to an input deduction, so GST is not an economic burden on business. 3.4 However, there is one circumstance when the correct GST outcome, from a policy perspective, is not achieved. This arises when an employee is engaged by a third- party company who is not their employer and the employee is required to account to the employer for the directors’ fees received. The diagram below illustrates the arrangement. 3.5 In the above scenario, the directors’ fees paid to the employee are not subject to GST, because section 6(3)(b) precludes them from having a taxable activity. However, when the employee passes these fees on to the employer (Company B), Company B is, under the Ruling, required to account for output tax on the supply of ―permitting the employee to be a director‖. 3.6 This result means that Company A will not receive an input deduction for the fees paid, because they are paid to a non-registered person who will not be able to provide a tax invoice. Company B will, however, have to account for output tax on the amount reimbursed by the employee. This lack of input deduction on an amount that ultimately generates output tax liability means that either Company A, Company B or both companies will bear GST as a cost. 3.7 The Ruling is also applied in comparable circumstances when an employee has been engaged as a member of a local authority or statutory board under section 6(3)(c). The situation with members of local authorities or statutory boards is slightly complicated by the fact that there is no proviso to section 6(3)(c) – meaning these members can never be registered. Our suggested solution below seeks to address the application of both sections. Reimburses fees to employer Pays Director’s fees Company A (GST registered) Director (no taxable activity) Company B (Director’s employer, GST registered) 6 Suggested solution 3.8 To avoid altering established contractual relationships or forcing directors to register for GST when they otherwise would not be required to do so, the simplest solution would be to treat Company B as making a supply to Company A (permitting their employee to be a director/member) to the extent that Company B is either paid directly by Company A or reimbursed by the employee. This supply would be treated as having been made for all relevant 6(3)(c) supplies and when a director was prohibited from registering under section 6(3)(b). 3.9 This would allow Company B to issue a tax invoice for the fees (or the relevant portion of the fees), and the related input tax deductions could be claimed by Company A. This suggestion could be workable because it is unlikely that Companies A and B will be unaware of their respective involvement. The practicalities, such as invoicing, could therefore be arranged at the time of the appointment. The suggestion could achieve a neutral outcome without imposing the compliance and administration costs of requiring the director to register for GST. 3.10 The rule should also logically extend to situations when Company B is a registered partnership or trust and the employee is a partner/trustee released to act as a director (or member of a local authority or statutory board). This would provide greater consistency in the GST treatment, irrespective of the commercial structure used. 3.11 It is important to note that the solution suggested would be aimed solely at ensuring GST neutrality in the transaction. It is not intended to alter the contractual relationships and, as such, would not affect the income tax treatment of any of the parties or the withholding obligations of the party making the payment. 7 CHAPTER 4 Apportionment rules Wash-up rule for taxable or non-taxable use 4.1 An issue has arisen with the GST treatment of land that has been purchased for both taxable and non-taxable use, but is later used solely for one or the other and is subject to on-going adjustments. 4 The question that arises is whether there reaches a point when a wash-up calculation should be performed to eliminate the need for continual adjustments. Example John purchases a building that is used 50 percent for commercial use and 50 percent apartments. On the basis that the apartments will be leased as dwellings, an input deduction of 50 percent is taken at the time of purchase. After two years, John gives notice to his tenants and signs an agreement with a management company that will operate the apartments as serviced apartments for business travellers. As serviced apartments are commercial dwellings, the building is now being used solely for making taxable supplies. John makes the necessary adjustments in subsequent adjustment periods to reflect the taxable and non-taxable proportion of use over his ownership period. Because of the two years of part non-taxable use, John will never be in a position to claim 100 percent of his inputs in relation to the building. 4.2 John is not compelled to make an adjustment in each period, because eventually the adjustments will fall within the $1,000 or 10% de minimis rule in section 21(2)(d). However, because John’s ―percentage taxable use‖ is always increasing, he may be motivated to claim the small additional amount of input tax at the end of each adjustment period. 4.3 We consider that the on-going adjustment requirement in these circumstances causes disproportionately high compliance costs for the revenue actually at risk. Suggested solution 4.4 We consider that there should be a wash-up calculation that a registered person must perform if they meet the following criteria:  their taxable use of the asset is 100 percent or 0 percent in both the relevant adjustment period and the adjustment period immediately prior; and  their percentage actual use over the course of their ownership of the asset is over 90 percent or under 10 percent, as the case may be. 4 This issue potentially applies to assets generally, but is most prevalent with land because of the rule in section 21G(5) that requires indefinite adjustments. 8 4.5 If the calculation were to be optional, registered persons could take advantage of it to complete their input claims, but would be less likely to use it if the result was an output tax liability. We therefore suggest making the calculation compulsory to capture both ends of the spectrum. 4.6 The adjustment calculations would need to begin again if the person again changed the use of the asset beyond the levels in the section 21(2) de minimis rules. Ensuring apportionment rules apply to all entity types 4.7 There is some confusion over how, or if, the apportionment rules apply to all GST- registered persons. In particular, there is a question over whether non-natural registered persons (such as a company) can have ―private‖ use of an asset and, if so, how to measure it. Example ABC Ltd is registered for GST. Sam and his brother Tim are the only shareholders in ABC Ltd. ABC Ltd buys a company car. It is anticipated that the car will be used 50 percent of the time for business purposes, 25 percent by Sam for his private use and 25 percent by Tim for his private use. 4.8 The policy intent behind the apportionment rules would see ABC Ltd claiming 50 percent of the input tax for the car, with the remaining 50 percent being unable to be claimed because of the private nature of the use. 4.9 However, there is an alternative interpretation that would allow ABC Ltd to claim all of the inputs. This comes about because the GST Act arguably treats the 50 percent ―private‖ use as taxable for the purposes of the apportionment rules. The supply of the car by ABC Ltd to Sam or Tim is an associated supply, to which the market value rules apply and for which ABC Ltd would be required to return output tax. 5 4.10 Although the supplies to Sam and Tim will generate an output tax liability for ABC, they also mean that the company is using the asset for 100 percent taxable supplies, so will not have to apply the apportionment rules to the car. 4.11 Over the life of most assets there may not be a materially different revenue impact between the two approaches. However, the alternative approach increases the compliance costs to ABC Ltd because, instead of simply being denied 50 percent of the input tax upfront, it is required to account for output tax on an on-going, per-use basis. 5 Section 10(3) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 9 Suggested solution 4.12 We consider that the definition of ―percentage actual use‖ in section 21G(1) should be clarified so that associated supplies are not treated as being taxable supplies. However, we recognise that creating a blanket rule could create difficulties because it may not be desirable to have all associated supplies dealt with through the apportionment rules. 4.13 The simplest approach, which also deals with the policy concerns around private use, would be to amend section 21G to exclude associated supplies, from being ―taxable supplies‖, when the recipient of the supply is a natural person. 4.14 Consequential amendments would be necessary to ―switch off‖ the output tax liability on the relevant supplies. The interplay between the associated supply rules and the fringe benefit rule in section 21I would also need to be considered to ensure that there is not effective double taxation by denying input deductions and then still charging output tax on the private use on the basis that a fringe benefit is being provided. Suggested application date 4.15 In order to reduce confusion and compliance costs for taxpayers who have, since the apportionment rules took effect, been apportioning input tax in accordance with the intended policy outcome, we consider that the revised rule should be retrospective to 1 April 2011. 4.16 However, to reflect the fact that genuine uncertainty exists, it may not be appropriate to force a registered person that has adopted the alternative interpretation to revisit their returns. We therefore consider that the amendment should include a ―savings‖ provision to preserve the position of people who have adopted the alternative interpretation. 4.17 Any savings provision that is enacted would generally only apply until the new rule is enacted. At that point, people whose position in respect of certain assets has been preserved may (depending on the value of the asset) need to make adjustments subsequent to the clarification to reflect use that is now confirmed as non-taxable. We welcome views on whether a grandparenting rule should be allowed for these assets. Output tax and the disposal of land 4.18 There appears to be a risk that a person can dispose of land (and other assets) outside the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, while still not returning all of the input claimed in relation to that asset. From a policy perspective, when input tax has been claimed on an asset and that asset is then on-sold, the on-selling should generally be subject to output tax. 10 4.19 Imposing output tax on the sale achieves broadly the right policy result because the registered person will already have an input deduction that reflects their taxable use of the asset and the wash-up calculation that occurs on sale may provide further input tax deductions to recognise the fact that: 6  the non-taxable use of the asset has contributed to its depreciation (assuming it is depreciating); and  further consumption of the asset is being enjoyed further down the supply chain. 4.20 Under these rules, if the asset is appreciating, the person will generally be entitled to a full input deduction on disposal. Even if the asset has depreciated in value, the calculation will give the person an additional input deduction. 4.21 A problem arises when a person uses land for making taxable supplies and then fully devotes it to a non-taxable purpose before disposal. In an extreme example, the person will have claimed a full input tax deduction for the land, and will use it for non-taxable purposes for a year or two and then dispose of it. The nature of the apportionment rules means that the person will still not have returned all of the acquisition input tax (they might have been using it in their taxable activity for a number of years). 4.22 However, on disposal, the person will arguably not be disposing of the land in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity – it having been taken out of that activity and devoted to private use. In these circumstances, it may be that no output tax is returnable on the sale and the calculation under section 21F does not have to be performed. 4.23 This factual scenario and possible interpretation does not produce the correct policy outcome. The person’s input position will reflect their use of the asset, but they will not be given the benefit of the additional input tax under section 21F. Equally, the consumption of the asset further down the supply chain will not be taxed appropriately. If the purchaser is not a registered person, they may not have to pay GST to the registered vendor, despite the fact that they are effectively a final consumer purchasing an asset from a registered person. 7 Suggested solution 4.24 Although this issue potentially arises for other assets, we consider a targeted solution that deals with land would be the most appropriate way to address the issue. Such a solution would recognise the fact that land is the most problematic area and would also avoid confusion for registered persons, such as financial service providers, that have claimed some inputs in respect of assets but may not consider their subsequent disposal as being the course or furtherance of a taxable activity (for example, a bank selling surplus office furnishings or computer equipment). 6 This wash-up calculation is contained in section 21F. 7 Note that this situation would not arise when the vendor is deregistering because of the deemed supply rule in section 5(3). 11 4.25 We therefore consider that the most appropriate way to resolve the issue would be to extend the scope of section 5(16) so that it applies to all subsequent supplies of land when input tax has been claimed (at present it is limited to dwellings). An amendment that treated such supplies as being in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity would require the supplier to charge output tax and also perform the wash-up calculation in section 21F. 4.26 We consider that a carve-out will be necessary for registered persons that have performed the wash-up calculation proposed on pages 7–8. In other words, if a person has already returned all of the output tax on their original purchase, the proposed rule automatically treating the subsequent disposal as being in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity should be switched off. In practice this would be determined on a case-by-case basis. If the disposal is in fact part of a taxable activity, sections 8 and 21F would apply in the usual way. Non-profit bodies and the apportionment rules 4.27 Non-profit bodies are able to take advantage of a special input deduction rule that allows them to claim all of their inputs except to the extent that the goods or services in question are used for making exempt supplies. 8 There is an argument, however, that a non-profit body to whom this rule applies may then have to return some or all of the input tax claimed under the apportionment rules. 4.28 This result could arise because, unless it intends to use, or uses, the goods or services for actually making taxable supplies, its use will fall outside the definitions of ―percentage actual use‖ and ―percentage intended use‖ in section 21G(1). This argument is potentially relevant for ―regular‖ taxable supplies as well as supplies of land to which section 20(3J) applies. Suggested solution 4.29 The apportionment rules were not intended to alter the input entitlements of non- profit bodies. We therefore consider that section 20(3K) should be amended to specify that it applies for the purposes of subsections (3) and (3C) and the definitions of ―percentage intended use‖ and ―percentage actual use‖ in section 21G(1). Suggested application date 4.30 We are not aware of any non-profit bodies having filed GST returns on the basis of the interpretation set out above. However, to provide clarity to this group, we consider this amendment should be made retrospective to 1 April 2011. 8 Section 20(3K). 12 CHAPTER 5 Zero-rating of land rules Allowing inputs to registered persons subject to the domestic reverse charge 5.1 The GST Act provides for what is effectively a ―domestic reverse charge‖ in circumstances when a person purports to be registered in order to zero-rate a land transaction, when they are in fact not registered. The effect of the domestic reverse charge is that the recipient is treated as the supplier, so has to return GST on the sale. This outcome was designed to prevent a purchaser representing that they are GST registered to take advantage of the lower price that might be available if the land was zero-rated. 5.2 Mechanically, this outcome is achieved through the following provisions:  When a transaction is incorrectly zero-rated, the recipient is treated as having supplied the relevant goods and services to themselves (section 5(23)).  On the assumption that the recipient is not otherwise a registered person, the recipient is treated as being registered from the date of the supply (section 51B(4)).  The person is then denied the ability to claim an input tax deduction in respect of the supply (section 20(4B)).  Once the tax is accounted for, the person may apply to be deregistered (section 51B(5)). 5.3 As recognition of the fact that the person might later use the land as part of a taxable activity, the proviso to section 20(4B) allows inputs to be claimed if the person ―later becomes a registered person... and uses the relevant goods for making taxable supplies‖. 5.4 What is not catered for under section 20(4B) is the fact that the purchaser may already be a registered person and the transaction may have been zero-rated as a result of a genuine error. Example Company A contracts to sell Company B various assets, including an interest in land. Both parties are GST-registered and make only taxable supplies. For GST purposes, it is not completely clear whether the transaction involves one or two supplies. If there is one supply, it should be zero-rated. However, if there are two supplies only the one containing the interest in land should be zero-rated. The parties treat the transaction as a single supply, but it is later determined that this treatment was incorrect. 13 5.5 Under a strict interpretation of the relevant provisions, section 5(23) would treat Company B as making the relevant supply to itself, but section 20(4B) would deny an input deduction – the proviso would not apply because Company B is already registered, rather than later becoming registered. This is despite the fact that Company B is using the relevant goods for making taxable supplies. Suggested solution 5.6 We consider that the proviso in section 20(4B) should be extended to cater for both a person that later becomes registered and a person already registered (in both cases only to the extent that they use the goods for making taxable supplies). Although it would be undesirable for the domestic reverse charge to become the default position for transactions where the parties are unsure of the legal status of the supply, the approach will provide the necessary certainty should an unintended error in the treatment arise. Suggested application date 5.7 Given the proposed change would reinforce existing policy, and is concessionary to taxpayers, we consider it should have an effective date of 1 April 2011. Clarifying section 11(8D) 5.8 It has been suggested that under the current wording of the Act, all assignments or surrenders of interests in land should be zero-rated – even if the other requirements for zero-rating land transactions are not met. 5.9 Section 11(8D) provides that: For the purposes of the zero-rating of land rules,— (a) a supply that is an assignment or surrender of an interest in land, is a supply chargeable with tax at 0%: 5.10 The section is designed to clarify that assignments and surrenders of interests in land are ―land‖ transactions for the purpose of the zero-rating rules. The policy intent of this section is that it should apply when the requirements for the zero-rating of land rules are met. 5.11 However, we are aware that the section could be interpreted more widely. In particular, it could be read to mean that all assignments or surrenders of an interest in land should be zero-rated even if, for example, the recipient of the supply is not GST-registered. 14 Suggested solution 5.12 We consider that the words ―chargeable with tax at 0%‖ should be replaced with ―of land‖. This would clarify that the assignment or surrender is a land transaction. Whether it should be zero-rated would then be determined on whether the requirements in section 11(1)(mb) are met. 5.13 It has also been suggested that the wording of section 11(8D) requires leases to be zero-rated when there is no extra payment made in advance, or contemporaneously, with the supply being made. We suggest that the provision should also be clarified to reflect the policy intent that standard commercial leases are not zero-rated unless there are significant lump-sum payments that pass under the agreement. Suggested application date 5.14 Section 11(8D), recently enacted, is itself a clarification amendment, recently introduced with retrospective application to 1 April 2011. As this is a further clarification and does alter the intended scope of the provision, we therefore consider that this change should have the same effective date. Procurement of a lease 5.15 In some transactions when a vendor/lessee is selling its business, the lease will not be assigned. Instead, as a condition of the business being sold, the vendor will procure that the lessor will enter into a new lease with the purchaser. Part of the consideration for the sale will be for this procurement or to compensate the vendor for fees payable for the early termination of the existing lease. 5.16 Because a new interest in land is created through this transaction (the lease between the lessor and the purchaser) there is no transfer of an interest in land between the vendor and the purchaser. Any consideration payable in respect of this supply will therefore not be subject to the zero-rating rule, even though the practical effect of the transaction is similar to an assignment of a lease. Suggested solution 5.17 We consider that payments for the procurement of a lease should be added to the list of ―land‖ transactions in section 11(8D), and amended in the manner referred to above. This would ensure that such transactions are zero-rated, subject to the requirements of section 11(1)(mb) being met. 15 CHAPTER 6 “Dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” definitions Rest homes and retirement villages 6.1 The definitions of ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ were amended with effect from 1 April 2011. The purpose of these changes was to provide clarity in the boundary between these definitions. This was achieved by narrowing the definition of ―dwelling‖ and updating the types of accommodation that should be treated as ―commercial dwellings‖. 9 6.2 It has always been the intention of the GST system that exempting a ―dwelling‖ provides substitutability between renting and owning a house. 10 Narrowing the ―dwelling‖ definition was therefore consistent with this policy objective. 6.3 Part of the amendment to the definition was importing the idea of ―quiet enjoyment‖ from section 38 the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (RTA). This concept was considered to encapsulate the distinction between a property that a tenant would genuinely consider to be their ―home‖ and one where their occupancy was more temporary. 6.4 However, a question has arisen that ―quiet enjoyment‖ may not always be able to be demonstrated in relation to the provision of accommodation of retirement villages and residential rest homes. 6.5 The definition of ―commercial dwelling‖ excludes (in paragraph (b)(ii)) ―a dwelling situated in a retirement village or rest home...‖. It has therefore historically been contemplated that it was possible for a retirement village or rest home to be comprised of both ―dwellings‖ (for occupants that were essentially independent) and ―commercial dwellings‖ (for occupants that require active care). 6.6 It is arguable that, in some cases, ―independent living‖ rest home accommodation fails to satisfy the ―quiet enjoyment‖ test. This is where rest home operators impose contractual obligations on tenants that allow the operator or its agents to enter the property with no (or very limited) notice to, for example, carry out maintenance checks. These contractual rights can be interpreted as being in contradiction to section 38 of the RTA, in particular when that section is read in conjunction with the ―landlord’s right of entry rules‖ in section 48 of that Act. 9 See commentary to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010, page 10. 10 White Paper (Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax) Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax, March 1985 \[B. 27\]. 16 6.7 It is therefore arguable that rest homes that have these contractual terms would only operate ―commercial dwellings‖. Although this would entitle the operators of these homes to input deductions, it would also mean they would be required to charge output tax on the rental payments by their tenants. This would be an unintended policy outcome from the 2011 changes to the definitions. Suggested solution 6.8 We consider the ―dwelling‖ definition should be clarified to include retirement village and rest home accommodation that could broadly be described as a principal place of residence where the occupant is living independently. Suggested application date 6.9 We suggest an application date of 1 April 2011 with a ―savings‖ provision for taxpayers who may have filed their tax returns on the basis that independent living arrangements are not ―dwellings‖ as defined. Requirement to be registered 6.10 When the definitions of ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ were amended, it was recognised that these changes would mean that some premises that were ―dwellings‖ would become ―commercial dwellings‖. To cater for this, a person that is, as a result of the change, making taxable supplies (of a commercial dwelling) is allowed an input tax deduction in relation to the relevant premises. 11 This compensates the person for the fact that their supplies going forward would attract output tax. 6.11 To avoid people claiming large deductions while only making minimal supplies, section 21HB provides that the input tax is only available if the person is ―registered under section 51(1)...‖ (section 51(1) being the compulsory registration provision). The intended effect of this rule is that a person may only claim the input tax if their supplies in relation to the commercial dwelling were over the $60,000 registration threshold. 6.12 However, a concern has been raised over whether the expanded definition of ―commercial dwelling‖ might adversely affect sole traders otherwise operating below the registration threshold. For example, a registered architect who is ―registered under section 51(1)‖ in respect of her architectural business also owns a holiday home that she occasionally rents out. Because of the changed definitions, the architect is required to bring the holiday home into her broader taxable activity – claiming an input deduction on the purchase price and returning output tax on subsequent rental arrangements. 6.13 It may be the case, however, that the architect would prefer not to be forced to incorporate the holiday home into her taxable activity for GST purposes. 11 Section 21HB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 17 Suggested solution 6.14 We do consider that an amendment to section 21HB is justified so that a sole trader who owns a rented property is not automatically registered for GST in relation to that property. 6.15 Section 21HB should be amended so that a person has the option of including the commercial dwelling as part of a broader taxable activity if their supplies of the commercial dwelling are under $60,000. This option should only be available if the person:  is affected by the changes to the ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ definition; and  is required to be registered for reasons other than the supply of a commercial dwelling. Suggested application date 6.16 The suggested amendment can only operate in favour of the taxpayer and addresses an unexpected outcome. Therefore, we suggest an application date of 1 April 2011. 18 CHAPTER 7 Credit notes 7.1 Credit or debit notes are issued in a range of circumstances to reflect that the payment for a supply may have been incorrectly stated and to allow the issuer to adjust their position accordingly. 12 7.2 One of the requirements of issuing a credit note under section 25(1) is that there must be a ―supply of goods and services‖ by a registered person. The section arguably does not apply when no supply has taken place, but GST has nevertheless been charged. For example, a registered person issues an invoice for an amount, plus GST, to a person on the assumption that a supply has taken place. However, it is later determined that the payment actually represented liquidated damages, which is not a ―supply‖ for GST purposes. 7.3 Under the current wording of section 25(1), the person that has provided the invoice is arguably not required to remedy the situation by providing a credit note. Although it may be possible for the Commissioner to return the GST to the ―supplier‖ by amending the relevant assessment, the amount may not be passed on to the person who actually bore the GST cost, providing the supplier with a windfall gain. A requirement to issue a credit note would achieve the right policy outcome of returning the GST to the person who originally paid it. 7.4 It has been suggested that section 25(1) does not cater clearly for situations when a supplier is simply mistaken about the GST treatment of a supply – for example, if a supply is incorrectly zero-rated or treated as exempt for GST purposes. These situations may result in an alteration of consideration for the purposes of section 25(1)(b), but it is not immediately apparent that that is the purpose of the provision. 7.5 Section 25(1)(ab) was introduced to cater for land transactions incorrectly accounted for. Although that section was directed at changes relating to land, there is nothing in theory that makes land a special case when it comes to issuing credit/debit notes. 7.6 We are aware that a provision requiring credit/debit notes to be issued when there has been no supply or when GST was incorrectly accounted for would operate as a general ―unjust enrichment‖ rule. However, if the GST treatment between the parties to a supply is incorrect the outcome should, in our view, be the same as for a change in consideration or value. Suggested solution 7.7 We consider section 25(1) should be amended to clarify that it also applies in situations when the GST treatment of a supply has been incorrectly accounted for. 12 Section 25(1), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 19 7.8 Consequential amendments may also be necessary to section 25(3) (relating to the specific requirements of credit and debit notes) so that credit and debit notes that deal with the instances set out above are valid. 7.9 When credit/debit notes are issued in the circumstances set out above, there is a question as to whether the adjustment should be treated as taking place in the same period as the original supply. Submissions on this point would be welcome. 7.10 One issue that may require further consideration is that of the compliance costs that might arise if the incorrect GST accounting were minor and spread over a wide customer group. The requirement for debit or credit notes needed, in order to deal with such cases, could be limited to situations when the supplier has sought an adjustment in their favour in their return.

Current rules and risks 1.2 A lease inducement payment is a payment given by a landlord to a prospective tenant as an “inducement” to enter into a commercial lease. Following the recent economic downturn, arrangements involving lease inducement payments have become a popular option for landlords to attract tenants without needing to reduce the rental income payable. This trend is reflected in more of these payments being identified by Inland Revenue during its tax audits. 1.3 For income tax purposes, a lease inducement payment is typically tax deductible for the payer (generally the landlord) and non-taxable for the recipient (the tenant). This systematic deductible/non-taxable tax treatment in a commercial context poses a risk to the tax base. 1.4 A lease inducement payment confers a tax advantage when inducing a tenant to enter into a lease arrangement compared with other forms of inducement such as reduced rents and contributions for fit-out costs. As the payments are non-taxable for a recipient, they effectively increase the recipient’s total after-tax income. Suggested solution 1.5 Given the arbitrage opportunity and revenue risk inherent in the current rules, officials seek feedback on making lease inducement payments taxable. A specific legislative solution would be required to allocate income and expenditure arising or incurred from these payments. Furthermore, an anti- avoidance provision would also be required to prevent arbitrage opportunities arising from the timing of income. The details of these suggested changes are discussed more fully in Chapter 3. 1.6 Officials invite submissions on the suggested solutions. Submissions will be taken into account when we make recommendations to the Government on any necessary legislative changes. 1.7 These would be included in a tax bill introduced in Parliament later this year, and would apply to commercial lease arrangements entered into on or after the day this issues paper is publicly released. 2 Submissions 1.8 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. Submissions should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact the submitter to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.9 Submissions should be made by 31 August 2012 and be addressed to: Lease inducement payments C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Lease inducement payments” in the subject line.

Lease inducement payments 2.2 A lease inducement payment is typically an unconditional lump sum cash payment from a landlord to a prospective tenant as an inducement to enter into a commercial lease. 2.3 Lease inducement payments usually proliferate when there is an oversupply of business premises during an economic downturn. The payments are used as an effective bargaining tool for landlords to entice tenants to enter into a lease without needing to reduce the rent. In this way, landlords can maintain a consistent and unimpaired flow of rental income from their property unlike other forms of inducements, such as reduced rent or a rent-free holiday. 2.4 Even in economic upturns, when there may be a shortage of business premises, lease inducement payments can enable landlords to secure major tenants in large buildings or for a longer term for the reasons outlined above. Tax treatment of lease inducement payments 2.5 There are no specific legislative provisions that deal with lease inducement cash payments. Therefore, the taxation of lease inducement payments is determined under general principles and provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. 2.6 Currently, lease inducement payments can be characterised differently for a payer and a recipient for income tax purposes. This is because the quality of a payment is determined separately for the payer and the recipient. 2.7 For the payer (normally the landlord), the payment would typically be tax deductible if the payer incurs the expenditure in the course of carrying on a business. For the recipient (the tenant), the payment is generally a non- taxable capital receipt if the payment is received in relation to a lease that relates to the structure of the tenant’s business. Also, the payment is a “negative” premium, and premium payments are usually recognised by the courts as capital rather than revenue. The capital nature of a lease inducement payment was confirmed by the Privy Council in Wattie. 1 1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie \[1999\] 1 NZLR 529. 4 Revenue risk 2.8 The current asymmetric tax treatment of lease inducement payments in being generally tax deductible for the landlord and a non-taxable receipt for the tenant is systematic in a commercial context and poses a risk to the revenue base. The tax cash value of deductible but non-taxable payments can be highly sensitive to both commercial and tax implications. 2.9 The systematic deductible/non-taxable tax treatment of lease inducement payments creates an incentive for contracting parties to sign up to a lease agreement that results in a tax advantage. These payments are tax-effective when inducing a tenant to enter into a lease arrangement compared with other forms of inducement, such as reduced rent and contributions for fit-out costs. As the payments are treated as a non-taxable capital receipt for the tenant, they effectively increase the total after-tax income for the tenant. 2.10 For example, a commercial landlord with premises that are used to generate $1,000,000 of rental income per year during an economic upturn would struggle to do so in a downturn. To induce a tenant to enter into a lease for a term of one year, the landlord could either reduce the rent from $1,000,000 to $600,000, or offer a lease inducement payment of $400,000 while maintaining the rent of $1,000,000. 2.11 Under the latter arrangement, it is mostly the tenant who receives the tax advantage as they do not pay income tax on the amount of lease inducement of $400,000, and can claim a tax deduction for rental income expense of $1,000,000 against their taxable income. As the lease inducement payment is deductible for the landlord, the landlord receives the same amount of after- tax income of $432,000 ($1,000,000 minus $400,000 lease inducement resulting in taxable income of $600,000 less income tax at 28%) while maintaining an unimpaired rental flow. 2.12 Although the tenant primarily receives the tax benefit in the above example, the benefit could be shared in practice between the tenant and the landlord through the level of the rent and the lease inducement payment. 2.13 The asymmetric tax treatment of lease inducement payments encourages taxpayers to convert revenue receipts into non-taxable capital receipts. 2 2.14 Other forms of lease inducements, such as reduced rent or a rent-free holiday, do not pose the same risk to the revenue base because the tax treatment of these inducements is symmetrical. The reduced rent or rent-free holiday reduces the deductible expenses of the tenant as well as the taxable income of the landlord. 3 2 However, a lump sum rent subsidy paid by a landlord would remain taxable under the current law. 3 Also, section GC 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 prevents avoidance opportunities from properties being rented out for inadequate rents. 5 Case for specific legislative solution 2.15 In the past, specific legislative provisions were provided to deal with types of payments that posed similar revenue risks. The legislative provisions modified the judicially delineated capital/revenue boundary to counter arrangements based on converting revenue receipts into capital receipts. 2.16 For example, contributions for fit-out costs previously presented a similar revenue risk to cash lease inducement payments, as the amount was non- taxable to the tenant and tax deductible for the landlord. The problem was addressed in Budget 2010, which introduced new capital contribution rules. 4 The amount is either included as income of the recipient or reduces the cost basis of the depreciable property. 2.17 Cash lease inducement payments are the only form of lease inducement that confers a tax advantage; and as such, could distort commercial decision- making processes. It is also not sensible for cash lease inducement payments, which could be used by tenants to pay for the fit-out of their premises, to be treated differently for tax purposes from payments that are contractually required to be spent on the same fit-out. 2.18 The suggested solution of making lease inducement payments taxable would result in a consistent tax treatment of premiums paid in relation to leases of land. Premiums paid to landlords are already taxable under section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 2.19 Other examples where Parliament has modified the capital/revenue boundary include redundancy payments, 5 payments received for restrictive covenants 6 and exit inducements. 7 2.20 Given the revenue risks associated with lease inducement payments, other countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada have enacted legislation to make these payments taxable. Making lease inducement payments taxable would therefore be in line with international norms. 4 See sections CG 8, DB 64, EE 48 and the definition of “capital contribution” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 5 Section CE 1(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 Section CE 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 7 Section CE 10 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 CHAPTER 3 Suggested solution 3.1 To address the revenue risks associated with lease inducement payments, this chapter discusses how these payments might be made taxable under the Income Tax Act 2007. 3.2 The changes suggested in this paper are based on legislation operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland, which provides a useful model for New Zealand. 8 Making lease inducement payments taxable 3.3 Under the suggested solution, an amount derived by a person or an associated person as an inducement to enter into, or in connection with, an arrangement that grants an estate or interest in, or a right in or over, land would be taxable. 3.4 In practice, this would mainly apply to commercial lease arrangements, including subleases, but would also cover licences and easements. The proposal would also apply to a transfer or extension of an interest or right granted in or over land, such as an assignment or renewal of a lease. 3.5 Arrangements involving a sale of land, including a leaseback agreement 9 would be specifically excluded. However, it is expected that lease arrangements with the option to purchase would be covered by the proposed changes. Also, the amounts derived by a person would not be taxable if the person is not able to deduct the amount of rent as their expenditure. This would exclude amounts relating to private residential purposes. 3.6 Under the suggested changes, the lease inducement amount could be paid by any person. Although the person making the lease inducement payment is likely to be a grantor of the interest or right in land (that is, a landlord), they could instead be an associated person. A broad application would preclude avoidance opportunities through lease inducement payments being made by persons other than the grantor. 10 The suggested solution would cover an amount paid by an assignor to induce an assignee to assign the existing lease. 8 Sections 99 to 103 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (UK); and section 98A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Ireland). 9 When an owner sells the property and it is leased back to them so that they can continue to use the property without owning it. 10 Note that the UK and Ireland impose a condition that the payment must be made by the grantor, an associated person, a nominee or a person acting on behalf of the grantor. 7 3.7 The amount derived by a person would include not only a lump-sum cash payment but also an amount in money’s worth. 11 Non-cash benefits received by the person as a lease inducement would be included in the person’s income. Examples of non-cash benefits could include:  A contribution to a tenant’s costs such as for start-up or relocation. A contribution for depreciable property that is already included in the capital contribution rules (section CG 8) would be specifically excluded.  A satisfaction or forgiveness of a tenant’s liabilities. Examples include meeting the tenant’s obligation to pay rent or an early termination payment under the old lease, forgiving debts, or providing interest-free loans.  Other non-cash benefits, such as a transfer of shares. Deductibility of lease inducement payments 3.8 The provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply to determine the deductibility of lease inducement payments. No special legislation should be necessary. The deductibility of these payments will depend on the taxpayer meeting the general permission in section DA 1. Timing of income and expenditure 3.9 Under the suggested approach, income from lease inducement payments and expenditure on them would be allocated on a straight-line basis over either the period of the lease arrangement or the period when the first rent review is due, whichever is the shorter. This approach is consistent with the ordinary accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. 12 3.10 Officials would prefer a specific legislative solution to provide certainty with timing the allocation of such payments for both income and deduction purposes. Specific timing provisions are currently provided for similar types of payments, such as premiums paid for the grant of leases (that is, the right to use land). Income from lease premiums is spread over six years, subject to the Commissioner’s discretion in section EI 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Expenditure on lease premiums is spread over the term of the lease under the depreciation rules and schedule 14. A similar approach could be taken for reverse premiums such as lease inducement payments. 11 See the definition of “amount” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 12 Sections BD 3 and BD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Also see the New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 and New Zealand SIC-15 Operative Leases – Incentives. 8 3.11 A specific anti-avoidance provision would be necessary to prevent arbitrage opportunities on the timing of income – for example, arrangements between associated parties with a very long duration that are designed to delay the recognition of income. Similarly, for arrangements that are entered into that require up-front payment but the commencement of the lease is delayed, the income would be recognised in the year of receipt. Legislative timetable and application date 3.12 The proposal to make lease inducement payments taxable could be included in a tax bill introduced in Parliament later this year, and apply to commercial lease arrangements entered into on or after the day this issues paper is publicly released. This application date would minimise risks to the revenue base and persons entering into commercial lease arrangements after this issues paper is released would be aware of the proposed changes to the rules.

This is concessionary compared with the tax treatment of most other forms of investment. 1.4 This issues paper suggests repealing the current specified mineral mining tax regime and replacing it with rules that are more aligned with general tax principles. The paper seeks readers’ views on the suggested rules and how the suggested rules might work in practice. Purpose of the review 1.5 The purpose of the review is to align the tax rules that apply to specified mineral miners with general tax principles. This review was announced as part of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme in March 2012. 1.6 Tax concessions are generally inconsistent with the Government’s general broad-base, low-rate tax policy framework. Not only do concessions narrow the Government’s tax base, they also tend to reduce capital productivity. In this case, they do so by subsidising investment in specified minerals, which encourages investment in this activity ahead of other investment which may have higher pre-tax rates of return. 1.7 The changes suggested in this paper are broadly consistent with the tax rules applying to most other business activities, and from a tax prospective, are intended to make investment decisions more efficient. Summary of suggested new rules 1.8 The key changes discussed in this issues paper are:  Continue to allow immediate tax deductions for prospecting and exploration expenditure. However, on the establishment of an operational mine, exploration expenditure on items used for the extraction of minerals will be clawed back and be deductible over the life of the mine. 2  Tax deductions for development expenditure will be deferred and allowed over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basis.  Expenditure incurred in the extraction of minerals will be subject to ordinary capital/revenue tax rules.  A tax deduction for restoration expenditure will be allowed in the year it is incurred. However, a tax deduction will be allowed for payments made to Inland Revenue in advance for expected restoration costs.  So-called ―revenue account treatment‖ will apply to land acquired for specified mineral mining. That is, sale proceeds will be taxable and the cost of acquiring and disposing of the land will be deductible.  Tax deductions for expenditure on assets whose economic life is tied to the life of the mine (excluding expenditure incurred in the prospecting and exploration phases) will be spread over the life of the mine, on a unit-of-production basis. When these assets are sold or disposed of, the consideration will be taxable in the year of disposal, less the balance of the miner’s costs associated with the asset.  General tax depreciation rules will apply to expenditure on assets with a useful life independent of the life of the mine. Normal depreciation recovery rules will apply to the sale or disposal of these assets. Points for submissions  Are there any aspects of the mining process that are not covered adequately by the suggested new rules?  Are there any aspects of the suggested new rules that will create unwarranted compliance costs?  In relation to the suggested claw-back rule for exploration expenditure, what exploration expenditure is likely to be clawed back, and is the scope of the claw-back rule appropriate?  Will the unit of production method for spreading deductions over the life of the mine result in undue compliance costs for certain mineral miners?  When considering the unit of production method is there a more appropriate method of accounting for additional development expenditure or changes in mineral reserves? Next steps 1.9 Submissions will be taken into account when officials report to the Government on recommended changes. Any resulting legislative changes are likely to be included in a future tax bill. 3 How to make a submission 1.10 Submissions should be addressed to: Specified minerals tax review C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Alternatively, submissions can be made by e-mailing policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with ―Specified minerals tax review‖ in the subject line. 1.11 The closing date for submissions is 7 December 2012. 1.12 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether the authors are happy to be contacted by officials to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.13 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason will be determined in accordance with that Act. You should make it clear if you consider any part your submission should be withheld under the Official Information Act. 4 CHAPTER 2 Background 2.1 The Income Tax Act 2007 differentiates between specified minerals (which include gold, silver and iron sands) and other minerals (including oil, gas and coal). The current tax rules that apply to a specified mineral miner allow an immediate tax deduction for:  prospecting, exploration and development expenditure, including expenditure on capital items like plant, machinery and production facilities; and  an amount set aside (appropriated) for mining exploration or mining development, if it is to be applied for these purposes within the next two years. The amount that can be appropriated is limited to the company’s net income for the year. 2.2 The current tax rules for specified mineral mining are therefore concessionary compared with most other sectors, including petroleum mining which also has a concessionary regime. This is because the current rules essentially allow an immediate deduction for capital expenditure and expenditure that has not yet been incurred. Under general tax principles, deductions for this expenditure should be deferred and allowed over the economic life of the asset that is being created (that is, a productive mine). 2.3 The objective of this review is to create a more neutral tax treatment for specified mineral miners by aligning those activities with general tax principles. 2.4 This objective is consistent with the Government’s Revenue Strategy outlined in Budget 2012, which states that: The tax system should be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet the Government's needs. The Government supports a broad-base, low-rate tax system that minimises economic distortions. 1 2.5 New Zealand’s broad tax bases and relatively low tax rates make the tax system among the most coherent in the OECD. This promotes efficiency and fairness. Industry-specific tax concessions are inconsistent with a broad- base, low rate tax system. 2.6 Specifically, the current tax concessions for specified minerals may bias investment into the sector and away from other investments that offer higher pre-tax rates of return. When this happens, New Zealand’s capital stock becomes less productive and economic performance could be adversely affected. 1 Budget 2012, Fiscal Strategy Report, pg 17. 5 2.7 The Government also wishes to ensure that the Crown is receiving a fair financial return from the development of the nation’s mineral resources. This return primarily comes from income tax and royalties. 2.8 Aligning the tax rules that apply to specified mineral miners with general tax principles should help ensure, from a tax perspective, that the Government receives a fair rate of return from the specified mineral mining sector and that investment decisions are made more efficiently. 6 CHAPTER 3 The mining process 3.1 The current tax rules and the suggested new rules are best understood with reference to the mining process, as different rules relate to each stage of the mining process. This chapter describes that process. The Crown Minerals Act 3.2 The Crown Minerals Act 1991 sets the broad legislative policy for prospecting, exploration and mining of Crown-owned minerals in New Zealand. These include all naturally occurring gold, silver, coal, other metallic and non-metallic minerals, and aggregates. 3.3 The allocation of rights (permits) to prospect, explore or mine minerals that are owned by the Crown is carried out by the issuing of permits under the Act. The allocation of permits broadly mirrors the complete process of mining, from discovery of an ore body through to the extraction of the minerals. The mining process 3.4 The process of mining, from discovery of an ore body through to the extraction of minerals and finally returning the land to its natural, usable or safe state comprises several distinct steps as described below: The mining process Prospecting Phase Exploration Phase Development and Mining Phase Rehabilitation Phase The prospecting phase 3.5 The prospecting phase involves the preliminary search for and the identification of an ore deposit. The techniques vary, but they typically have a low impact upon the land. Prospecting broadly involves identifying land likely to contain exploitable mineral deposits or occurrences. It includes aerial, geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys, and the taking of samples by hand or hand-held devices. 7 The exploration phase 3.6 The exploration phase involves more intensive methods to define the extent, location and value of the ore present. This leads to a quantitative estimate of the size and grade of any deposits identified. This estimate is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the preliminary view on whether any ore deposits within the permit area are economic to recover. This determines whether further investment in delineating the resource and engineering studies is warranted. It also identifies key risks and areas for further work. 3.7 If further investment is justified, a feasibility study is undertaken to evaluate the financial viability, the technical and financial risks, and the robustness of the project. This study includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, including understanding the mineral chemistry and ore recoverability, marketability and expected returns on the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The development and mining phase 3.8 Once the analysis determines the ore deposit is worth recovering, development begins to create access to the ore body. Progress towards mining operations involves acquiring a mining permit and other consents, and the construction of production, processing, storage and transport facilities. The mine buildings and processing plants are constructed and any necessary equipment obtained. Operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. The rehabilitation phase 3.9 Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, rehabilitation begins to make the land suitable for future use by others. Typically, good mine management will involve a rehabilitation programme that ensures, where practical, land rehabilitation is gradually undertaken over the life of the mine. General points 3.10 It is important to note that entities involved in mining will typically abandon a project once there is enough information about a deposit to suggest that minerals are not economically recoverable. 3.11 Further, mineral exploration and development does not cease with a decision to mine. Exploration is often conducted to find ore deposits close to the primary deposit. This activity often uses information generated as a result of mining the deposit and is typically called ―brown-fields exploration‖. 8 CHAPTER 4 Current tax rules The specified mineral tax rules provide tax concessions to miners of certain 4.1 listed (―specified‖) minerals. There are some 50 specified minerals, of which gold, silver and iron sands are the most commonly mined. The main tax concessions for mineral mining are contained in subpart DU of 4.2 the Income Tax Act 2007 and provide:  immediate tax deductions for expenditure that would normally be capitalised and depreciated over the useful life of the mine. For example, a miner extracting specified minerals may claim immediate deductions for expenditure on land, plant or machinery, production facilities and preparing the site for mining operations; and  tax deductions for amounts set aside (appropriated) for mining exploration or mining development that will be applied for these purposes within the next two years. The overall effect of the specified mineral tax rules is that a miner’s income 4.3 tax liability can be deferred for significant periods of time. This chapter discusses the main aspects of the existing tax rules that apply to miners of the 50 specified minerals. Meaning of “specified mineral” The list of 50 specified minerals is contained in section CU 28 of the Income 4.4 Tax Act. The list includes gold, silver, iron sands, phosphate and platinum group elements. Prospecting and exploration expenditure Prospecting and exploration expenditure is deductible as it is incurred, as 4.5 provided by section DU 1. Exploration expenditure includes prospecting expenditure and refers to expenditure a mining company incurs in exploring or searching in New Zealand for a specified mineral. Section CU 24 defines exploration expenditure and includes amounts incurred on: a. acquiring mining prospecting information: b. acquiring a mining or prospecting right: c. geological mapping and geophysical surveys: d. systematic searches for areas containing specified minerals: e. searching by drilling in areas containing specified minerals: f. searching for ore containing a specified mineral within or in the vicinity of an ore body by crosscuts, drilling, drives, rises, shafts or winzes. 9 Development and rehabilitation expenditure Mining development expenditure is deductible as it is incurred, as provided 4.6 in section DU 1. Mining development expenditure is expenditure that a company incurs in its mining or associated operations and includes expenditure on restoring the mining site. Section CU 23 defines development expenditure and includes amounts incurred on: a. acquiring land for mining operations: b. preparing the site for mining operations: c. restoring the site during or after mining operations: d. any of the following for mining operations: i. buildings, mineshafts, platforms, tunnels, wells, or other improvements: ii. plant or machinery, including vehicles: iii. production equipment or facilities: iv. storage facilities: e. vessels or aircraft for use wholly or mainly in mining operations: f. providing, or contributing to the cost of providing, communication equipment, fuel, light, power, or water for the site of mining operations: g. buildings or facilities that— i. are situated at, or adjacent to, the site of any mining operations; and ii. are for use in the education, housing, or welfare of, or the supply of meals to, its employees in or connected with mining operations or in the education, housing, or welfare of, or the supply of meals to, the employees’ dependants. h. Providing, or contributing to the cost of providing, communication equipment, fuel, light, power, or water for the buildings or facilities described in paragraph (g). Appropriated amounts A mining company is also allowed a tax deduction in advance for amounts 4.7 appropriated for use as mining exploration expenditure or mining development expenditure. The amount of the deduction is based upon the amount of expenditure the company will, or considers likely to, incur in the following two years. The amount appropriated cannot exceed the amount of net income in the year the appropriation is made, as provided in section DU 4. 10 Appropriated amounts for mining development or mining exploration 4.8 expenditure, when a deduction has been taken in the year that it was appropriated, is treated as income from mining in the following income year, as provided in section CU 9. Loans A New Zealand company that holds shares in a ―mining company‖ may 4.9 claim a deduction for amounts written off in relation to loans made to the mining company for funding its exploring, searching or mining activities. The deduction allowed is for the principal (but not interest) written off. The amount of the deduction is up to the lesser of 50 percent of the net 4.10 income of the holding company for the tax year the deduction is claimed, or the holding company’s proportionate share of the operating company’s total outgoings on exploration and development, reduced by any similar deduction allowed in a previous tax year (as provided by section DU 12). Under section CU 17, a holding company of a mining company that has been 4.11 allowed a deduction for an amount it has written off on a loan made to the mining company must, to the extent of the deduction, include as income:  any repayment of that debt made by the mining company (whether the repayment is made to the holding company or to any other person);  any amount derived from the disposal of shares (or an interest in shares) in the mining company that is in excess of the amount paid up in cash on the shares by the holding company; and  any net income that would have been derived by the mining company in a later tax year in accordance with section CU 19. The income is allocated to the income year in which the mining company 4.12 repays the amount or, in the last two cases, is treated as repaying the amount. Sale of shares The assessment of income from the sale of shares in a mining company that 4.13 would ordinarily be taxable because the shares were acquired with the intention of resale or the person was in the business of share dealing may be deferred. The deferral applies when the income is reinvested for mining purposes (as 4.14 defined in section CU 29). The period of deferral can be up to six income years following the year that the shares are sold. 11 If any part of the above consideration is used for non-mining purposes, or the 4.15 six-year period lapses, the amount is income in the year that it is used for non-mining purposes, or at the end of the six-year period (whichever is the earlier). However, if the above consideration is lent to a mining company, the principal repaid is income unless the repayment is further invested for mining purposes within six income years of receipt. Deferral can also apply if the shares were sold to a mining company in return 4.16 for shares in that company. If the mining company is liquidated, any shares held are deemed to be sold to 4.17 the company. All distributions on the liquidation are deemed to be consideration for the sale of shares, and any resultant profit is income. Losses and grouping Under section DU 7 a mining company may deduct a net loss from one class 4.18 of income (mining income) against another class of income (income from other sources). This is subject to the qualification that any mining income deducted from the non-mining income should be reduced by one-third. For example, every $100 of mining loss is worth only $66.66 when making the deduction from non-mining income. However, under section CU 13 any income derived by a non-resident mining 4.19 operator from outside of the mining venture is separately assessed without regard to any income or expenditure incurred on the mining venture. Special rules apply to the consolidation of mineral mining operations to 4.20 ensure that:  under section FM 31(2) a mineral mining company may only form a consolidated group with other wholly owned mineral mining companies; and  losses incurred by a mineral mining company are ring-fenced to the mining company and to the relevant mining permit area, when shareholder continuity has been breached, or the company is not wholly owned. Under section IA 7 any losses from a permit area may be offset against the net income in the year of claim from the permit area. Integrity measures Given the generous deduction rules for specified mineral mining expenditure, 4.21 the rules deem income from mining to arise in a number of situations. 12 Under section CU 3 the rules treat income from mining to be derived when 4.22 an asset is transferred and an amount has previously been allowed as a deduction as mining development or mining exploration expenditure for that asset. Transfers include:  an asset used to derive income from mining is used to derive income other than income from mining. The amount of income from mining is an amount equal to the market value of the asset on the first day the asset is used to derive income not from mining); and  an asset used to derive income from mining, including mining prospecting information or a mining or prospecting right, is sold or disposed of. The amount derived from the disposal is treated as income from mining (there are various rules to assist with quantifying the amount – for example, when a mining asset is sold to an associated person it is treated as having been sold for market value). Income from mining also includes compensation received for the loss, 4.23 damage, or destruction of mining assets. When the asset is not restored or replaced, the insurance proceeds are treated as income from mining in the year received. When an asset is restored or replaced, only the excess of insurance plus scrap proceeds over restoration or replacement costs are included within income from mining. Under section CU 4 any costs of replacement or restoration that exceed insurance and scrap proceeds may be deducted in the year incurred. 13 CHAPTER 5 Economic framework for the suggested new rules 5.1 As discussed in chapter two, the Government’s objective is to, where possible, have a tax system that raises revenue in a fair and efficient manner. This is achieved by adopting a broad-base, low-rate tax policy framework that minimises economic distortions. 5.2 The suggested new rules governing the specified mineral mining are intended to reflect these objectives. This chapter outlines the economic policy behind the suggested new rules. Economic background 5.3 For taxes to be neutral and therefore not distort investment decisions, expenditure incurred in acquiring future economic benefits should be amortised over the expected period of the future benefits. This principle applies equally to situations when expenditure is intended to produce future economic benefits but fails to do so. 5.4 A simple example demonstrates this principle in Table 1. Assume that there is an asset that is expected to produce a stream of income over five years and then expire. In years one to five it is estimated that the asset will produce the following series of cashflows: $300, $280, $260, $240 and $220. Table 1: Marginal project, world without tax and no uncertainty World without tax Investment $ 1,000 Discount rate 10% Year Cashflow 1 $ 300 2 $ 280 3 $ 260 4 $ 240 5 $ 220 Sum of cashflows $ 1,300 Net present value of cashflows $ 1,000 Initial investment -$ 1,000 Difference $ - 14 5.5 In a world without taxes and assuming a risk-free discount rate of 10 percent (10 percent is used to keep things simple), an investor would be indifferent between buying, for $1,000, the series of cashflows or placing $1,000 in the bank. The project can therefore be described as marginal. 5.6 For taxes to neither encourage nor discourage this investment, the $1,000 should be deductible over this five-year period. Moreover, the amount of the tax deduction in each year should mirror the asset’s expected decline in value. When the tax rules do this, an investor is still indifferent between buying for $1,000 the series of after-tax cashflows or placing $1,000 in the bank. 5.7 Table two demonstrates that when the tax rules allow a deduction for an asset’s actual decline in value, the project remains marginal despite the introduction of taxes. While the example is for a riskless investment, this analysis applies equally to risky investments. Table 2: Marginal project, world with tax (deductions spread) and no uncertainty World with taxes (deductions spread) Investment $ 1,000 Post-tax discount rate 7% Tax rate 30% Year Cashflow (1) Depreciation (2) Tax (1-2)\*30% Post-tax cashflow 1 $ 300 $ 200 $ 30 $ 270 2 $ 280 $ 200 $ 24 $ 256 3 $ 260 $ 200 $ 18 $ 242 4 $ 240 $ 200 $ 12 $ 228 5 $ 220 $ 200 $ 6 $ 214 Sum of cashflows $ 1,210 Net present value of cashflows $ 1,000 Initial investment -$ 1,000 Difference $ - 5.8 In a world with a 30 percent tax rate, the post-tax discount rate is seven percent (.10 x (1 – .3), and the total amount of tax paid is $90. Allowing a tax deduction for the asset’s actual decline in value, in this case $200 per year, means that this project remains the marginal project in a world with taxes. 15 5.9 This can be contrasted with a scenario where an immediate deduction is allowed when the investment is made. This is illustrated in table three. Table 3: Marginal project, world with tax (immediate deduction) and no uncertainty World with taxes (immediate deductions) Investment $ 1,000 Post-tax discount rate 7% Tax rate 30% Year Cashflow Immediate deduction Tax Post-tax cashflow 0 $ - $ 1,000 -$ 300 $ - 1 $ 300 $ - -$ 210 $ 300 2 $ 280 $ - -$ 126 $ 280 3 $ 260 $ - -$ 48 $ 260 4 $ 240 $ - $ 24 $ 216 5 $ 220 $ - $ 66 $ 154 Sum of cashflows $ 1,210 Net present value of cashflows $ 1,012 Initial investment -$ 1,000 Difference $ 12 5.10 Although the investor pays the same amount of tax ($90) an immediate tax deduction means that the investor’s tax liability is deferred (until year four), as the first three years the investor has a tax loss. As a result, the post-tax cashflows are greater in the first few years, which in turn results in the cash flows having a higher net present value ($1,012). In this scenario, taxes are no longer neutral and the investor is incentivised to take up the series of cash flows instead of placing the $1,000 in the bank. Fair return 5.11 As well as making the tax rules applying to specified mineral mining neutral, the Government is also concerned to ensure that New Zealand obtains an adequate return from the exploitation of its mineral reserves. 5.12 The current specified mining tax rules enable mining companies to defer the payment of income tax. This has a direct cost to the Crown. Assuming that the Government’s cost of capital is five percent, allowing mining companies to defer a $100 million tax liability for three years would cost the Crown approximately $15 million over the three years. 16 CHAPTER 6 More neutral tax rules 6.1 This chapter outlines the suggested new tax rules for specified mineral miners. It suggests that the existing specified mineral mining rules be replaced with rules that reflect the economic principles discussed in the previous chapter, while being broadly consistent with the taxation of other industries. Overview of the suggested new rules 6.2 The following table summarises the suggested new rules for specified mineral miners: Item Suggested tax treatment Prospecting expenditure Allow a tax deduction in the year the expenditure is incurred. Exploration expenditure Allow a tax deduction in the year the expenditure is incurred. However, on the establishment of an operational mine, exploration expenditure on items used for the extraction of minerals is clawed back and is deductible over the life of the mine. Development expenditure Defer tax deductions and allow these over the life of the mine, on a unit-of-production basis. Mining expenditure Expenditure incurred in the extraction of minerals is subject to ordinary capital/revenue tax rules. Rehabilitation expenditure Allow a tax deduction in the year the expenditure is incurred. However, a tax deduction would be allowed earlier for payments made to Inland Revenue in advance for expected restoration costs. Expenditure on land Apply so-called ―revenue account treatment‖ to land acquired in the prospecting, exploration and development phases. That is, sale proceeds would be taxable and the cost of acquiring and disposing of the land would be deductible. Assets with a life tied to the life of the mine Tax deductions for expenditure on assets whose economic life is tied to the life of the mine (excluding expenditure incurred in the prospecting and exploration phases) would be spread over the life of the mine, on a unit-of-production basis. When such assets are sold or disposed of, the consideration would be taxable in the year of disposal, less the balance of the miner’s costs associated with the asset. Assets with a life independent of the mine Apply general tax depreciation rules to expenditure on assets with a useful life independent of the life of the mine. Normal depreciation recovery rules would apply to the sale or disposal of such assets. During the development phase depreciation deductions would be capitalised and amortised over the life of the mine on a unit-of- production basis. 17 6.3 Prospecting expenditure is generally incurred to identify and provide an initial view about the mining potential of mineral deposits within an area covered by a prospecting permit. 6.4 Under a strict framework, tax deductions for prospecting expenditure would be deferred and allowed as a deduction over the economic life of the mine. However, adopting this treatment would be inconsistent with the tax treatment of early-stage expenditure in other industries. For example, the existing petroleum mining rules allow immediate deductions for prospecting expenditure. 6.5 For this reason, the suggestion is to allow prospecting expenditure to remain deductible in the year it is incurred. 6.6 Prospecting expenditure would be limited to expenditure directly incurred on acquiring prospecting permits and information, labour, materials, services, administrative overheads and other expenses in prospecting for specified minerals. Prospecting expenditure would not include the costs of land. Exploration expenditure 6.7 Exploration expenditure is generally incurred to determine whether the minerals identified in the prospecting phase can be profitably recovered. 6.8 As discussed in the previous chapter, for tax to be neutral, expenditure incurred on acquiring something that will provide future economic benefits should be amortised over the expected period of future benefits. However, like prospecting expenditure, adopting this treatment for exploration expenditure would appear harsh when compared with the tax treatment of similar expenditure in other industries. For example, the existing petroleum mining tax rules allow immediate tax deductions for exploration expenditure. 6.9 Therefore, the suggestion is to allow exploration expenditure to remain deductible in the year that it is incurred. 6.10 Exploration expenditure would be limited to expenditure incurred on acquiring exploration permits and information, labour, materials, services, administrative overheads, and other expenses on exploration and feasibility studies. Exploration expenditure would not include the costs of land. Claw-back rule 6.11 It is also suggested that on the establishment of an operational mine, exploration expenditure on items used for the extraction of minerals would be clawed back and allowed as a deduction over the life of the mine. 18 6.12 The suggested claw-back rule is consistent with the tax treatment of petroleum mining, where expenditure on an exploration well is clawed back if that well is then used to extract resources. 6.13 The claw-back rule is also intended to buttress the division between the ―exploration‖ and ―development‖ phases. That is, the claw-back rule will reduce the incentive to reclassify development expenditure as exploration expenditure in order to receive immediate deductions, as those deductions will be clawed back. 6.14 Similar to the claw-back rule in the petroleum tax regime, the claw-back of previous deductions would be achieved by treating an amount of income as arising in the first year of commercial production. The amount of income treated in this way would be equal to the amount of expenditure that has been previously claimed on items in the exploration phase that are subsequently used in the extraction process. A deduction would then be allowed for that amount over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basis. Example An immediate deduction would be allowed for the costs associated with establishing an access road initially used in the exploration phase. However, if that road is later used in the mineral extraction phase, the cost associated with establishing the road would be treated as income in the first year of commercial production. That same amount would be an allowable deduction and allocated over the life of the mine. Development expenditure 6.15 Once a profitable mineral resource is found, development of a mine begins. Expenditure on developing a site for mining operations includes the costs of acquiring the mining permits, resource consents, and establishing mine infrastructure, including processing and transportation infrastructure. 6.16 Under general tax principles, expenditure that is incurred to produce a capital asset should not be immediately deductible. Rather, the costs should be capitalised and written off over the economic life of the asset. Similarly, when a miner spends money developing a mineral resource, that expenditure should be seen as part of the cost of producing a productive mine. 6.17 Therefore, it is suggested that these costs should be deducted over the life of the mine, on a unit-of-production basis. Life of the mine 6.18 The ―life of the mine‖ is based on the estimated reserves of minerals in the permit area at the beginning of the year. The deductions for the development expenditure would be then aligned with the amount of minerals extracted during the year. 19 6.19 The suggested method of allocating deductions over the estimated reserves is heavily influenced by the International Reporting Template (IRT) work of the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRCSO). The IRT is a document that draws on the best of the CRIRSCO-style reporting standards, the JORC Code (Australasia), SAMREC Code (South Africa), Reporting Code (UK / Western Europe), CIM Guidelines (Canada), SME Guide (USA) and Certification Code (Chile). These reporting standards are recognised and adopted world-wide for market-related reporting and financial investment. 6.20 The IRT sets out a framework for classifying tonnage and grade estimates of mineral deposits according to levels of geological confidence and degree of technical and economic evaluation. Having reviewed this work, we consider that the most appropriate estimate for amortising the development costs of a mining permit is on the basis of ―proven‖ plus ―probable‖ mineral reserves. 6.21 A proven mineral reserve represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimates. A probable mineral reserve has a lower level of confidence, but is of sufficient quality for the deposit to be developed. Together, these estimates represent the economically recoverable part of the mine. 6.22 This estimate also provides allowances for diluting materials, and the losses which may occur when the material is mined. This includes the consideration of, and modification by, realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 6.23 Deductions for development expenditure under the depletion method would be computed according to the following basic formula: Allowable deduction = expenditure x proportion of extracted minerals  expenditure: The amount of development expenditure, less the expected residual value, reduced by the total deductions allowed in previous tax years; and  proportion of extracted minerals: The proportion that the current production in that year bears to the estimated total recoverable reserves remaining at the beginning of the year. 6.24 From time to time, over the life of a field, additional development expenditure may be required to maintain production or bring new reserves into production. It is suggested that miners account for additional development expenditure in the income year directly following the year in which the expenditure was incurred. 20 6.25 A similar approach is suggested to deal with changes in reserves. That is, changes in reserves will be counted in the year directly following the year the reserve’s estimate is adjusted. Estimates of reserves may change over the life of the mine. This may be due to external reasons, like a natural disaster, or to changes in the expected price of the mineral. It may also occur because of matters relating to the specific field, such as original reserve estimates being less than previously estimated. 6.26 While there is an element of approximation in both these suggested treatments, they have the benefit of being relatively straightforward. Mining expenditure 6.27 It is suggested that expenditure incurred in the extraction of the minerals be subject to ordinary capital/revenue tax rules. 6.28 This means that expenditure on revenue items will be immediately deductible, and expenditure on capital assets will either be deductible over the life of the asset or over the life of the mine. 6.29 Whether the cost of the asset is deductible over the life of the asset or the life of the mine depends on whether the asset’s life is independent or tied to the life of the mine. This concept is discussed in paragraphs 6.36 to 6.44. 6.30 This suggested rule is intended to align the specified mineral mining tax rules with ordinary tax principles. Cost of land 6.31 Under the suggested new rules, land acquired directly for prospecting, exploration or mining development would be treated as ―revenue account property‖. This means the sale proceeds would be taxable and the cost of acquiring and disposing of the land would be deductible in the year of sale. 6.32 Where land is disposed of for consideration below the costs of the asset, a loss on disposal would be allowed. 6.33 This treatment reflects the fact that mining generally decreases the value of land. This is because land values may reflect the unexploited minerals contained in the land. As minerals are extracted, the value of the land decreases, representing a cost of the mine. Therefore, miners should be able to claim a deduction for the decline in value. 6.34 Conversely, any realised gains should also be taxable. Otherwise, the tax base would be subsidising the mining industry by allowing deductions for realised losses while not taxing realised gains. 21 6.35 Furthermore, if mining land were not taxable on sale or disposal, a specified mineral miner may in certain situations be able to extract the value of economically recoverable resources without tax, by selling the land rather than mining and selling the resources. Assets with a life independent of the mine 6.36 Under the suggested new rules, the cost of assets with useful lives independent of the life of the mine would be amortised over the assets estimated useful life, in accordance with the current depreciation rules. This includes the costs of assets attained during the prospecting, exploration, development, mining phases and rehabilitation phases. 6.37 This would include assets that have a different lifespan to that of the mine. Examples include assets that could be reasonably expected to be moved to other operations, such as motor vehicles or on-site office equipment. These assets are likely to have a useful life less than the mine. Other assets – for example, a tailings dam, may have a useful life beyond the life of the mine. 6.38 Depreciation deductions on these assets incurred during the development phase, and before the mine becomes operational, should be capitalised and deductible over the life of the mine. This treatment is appropriate for these expenses as they represent the cost of producing a capital asset (the operational mine). Once the mine becomes operational, the capitalised depreciation deductions have a nexus with the income-earning process and are allowable over the life of the mine. 6.39 Furthermore, it is suggested that normal depreciation recovery rules would apply to the disposal of assets that have a life independent of the mine. For example, disposal of an asset for more than its adjusted tax value creates depreciation recovery income. Conversely, if the calculation of depreciation recovery income reveals a loss, a further deduction for that loss will be allowed. Assets tied to the life of the mine 6.40 It is suggested that the cost of assets that is commercially inseparable from the mineral deposits be amortised over the life of the mine (excluding expenditure that creates assets with a life tied to the mine in the prospecting and exploration phase, as it is suggested an immediate deduction would be allowed). Such assets might include items that are not readily movable (for example roads, buildings and utilities) or assets that are so specialised that there is no other economic use for them other than to extract minerals from a particular mine. 22 6.41 There are a number of ways of allocating the costs of assets that are commercially inseparable from the mineral deposits within the mining permit area. Such costs could be allocated over the life of the mining permit, including renewals, or over the geological mineral resource estimates for the mining permit area. Our preference is for the latter, because this method is most likely to better reflect the pattern of consumption of the assets’ future economic benefits. 6.42 Further, it is suggested that the proceeds from the sale or disposal of such assets be taxable, less the balance of the miner’s costs associated with the asset in the year of disposal. If assets are disposed of for consideration below the costs of the asset, a loss on disposal would be allowed. 6.43 The rationale for the suggested change is similar to the rationale behind the suggested treatment of mining land on revenue account. That is, the value of the asset (similar to land) will generally be tied to the value of the mine and, as minerals are extracted, the value of the asset will generally decrease. Therefore, miners should be able to claim a deduction as the asset declines in value. 6.44 The suggested new rule also reduces the incentive to extract the value of economically recoverable resources without tax by selling the asset rather than mining and selling the resources. Mine reclamation and monitoring expenditure 6.45 Typically, mining companies are required to restore, or at least make safe, land and land improvements once mining activities have ceased. These obligations often extend to requirements to monitor and remedy any post- mining environmental risks and hazards. 6.46 It is suggested that deductions be allowed for mining reclamation and monitoring expenditure in the year this expenditure is incurred. These costs are incurred in producing taxable income from the mining activities and therefore should be deductible in the year that they are incurred. 6.47 However, given these costs are often incurred after the mining activity ceases to earn income, it is suggested to allow deductions for payments made to Inland Revenue for expected mining reclamation and monitoring expenditure. The payments would be based on amounts that the miner has made a provision for in their financial accounts. 6.48 These payments will be held on account for the mining company and will be able to be drawn down on when these liabilities fall due. The rules would broadly follow the current environmental restoration account rules in subpart EK of the Income Tax Act 2007. 23 CHAPTER 7 Other matters Income from mining 7.1 A mining company is currently required to separate its mining income from other income. Expenditures and losses also have to be categorised into amounts relating to mining exploration or development (or income from mining) and amounts that relate to other income. 7.2 A mining company may deduct a net loss from one class of income from the other class of income. This is subject to the qualification that any mining income deducted from the non-mining income should be reduced by one- third (for example, every $100 of mining loss is worth only $66.66 when making the deduction from non-mining income). 7.3 Repealing the rules is suggested for classes of income and the deduction reduction rule for future expenditure incurred by mining companies. Mining loans 7.4 Currently, a New Zealand company that holds shares in a mining company may claim a deduction for amounts written off in respect of loans, excluding interest, made to the mining company to fund its exploring, searching or mining activities. Should this amount be recovered, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the power, at any time, to reopen the assessments on the holding company and disallow the deductions. 7.5 Repeal of these rules is suggested for future loans and allow the general provisions for bad debt and bad debt recoveries to apply. Appropriation of income 7.6 A specified mining company is currently allowed a deduction for an amount of income appropriated towards mining exploration or development expenditure. The deduction is allowed in the year that the appropriation is made. This rule is concessionary compared with the general deduction rules. 7.7 It is suggested that the current appropriation rule be repealed. 24 Insurance proceeds for mining assets 7.8 The current rules treat compensation received for the loss, damage or destruction of mining assets as income to the miner. 7.9 It is suggested this rule be repealed and that the normal tax treatment of insurance receipts apply. Therefore, if the compensation is for the loss of trading profits the payment is generally taxable. If the compensation relates to the damage to an asset, the compensation is generally a non-assessable capital receipt. Farm-out arrangements 7.10 A farm-out arrangement is a contractual agreement where a mineral rights owner or lessee (the vendor) assigns a working interest to another party (the purchaser) who will become responsible for specific exploration, development or production activities. 7.11 It is suggested that the consideration received by the vendor, less any costs that the vendor has not already claimed and losses carried forward, would be taxable in the year of sale. 7.12 Further, the purchaser would capitalise the purchase price and deduct it over the life of the mine on a unit-of-production basis. However, if the purchase was made during the prospecting and exploration phase, it is suggested that the purchaser would be able to claim an immediate deduction for the purchase cost. 7.13 Any expenditure subsequently incurred by the parties to the farm-out arrangement would be treated according to the suggestions outlined in this paper (ensuring that the vendor and the purchaser do not both claim for the same expenditure). For example, development expenditure incurred by the purchaser would be capitalised and allocated over the life of the mine. Grouping and losses 7.14 Mining companies seek ore deposits with characteristics that enable its profitable extraction and processing. Often the subsequent analysis of mineral deposits identified during the prospecting phase determines that the identified ore deposit is not worth recovering. In theory, the costs of unsuccessful projects should be offset against the next successful project. After all, mining businesses expect to be compensated for costs incurred in the unsuccessful prospects by the successful mines. 7.15 Currently, special rules apply to the consolidation of mineral mining operations to ensure that a mineral mining company may only form a consolidated group with other wholly owned mineral mining companies. These rules are likely to have been put in place because of the concessions that applied to specified mineral mining. 25 7.16 Provided most of the current concessions for specified mineral mining are repealed, we see no policy reason why normal grouping rules should not apply to entities involved with specified mineral mining. 7.17 In addition, under the current rules, losses incurred by a mineral mining company are ring-fenced to the mining company and to the relevant mining permit area when shareholder continuity has been breached. That is, losses can only be used to offset income derived from the permit area. 7.18 With the suggested changes to the specified mining rules, it seems unnecessary to keep the current loss ring-fencing rules for losses incurred under the new rules. Instead, the normal shareholder continuity rules should apply. Resident and non-resident mining operators 7.19 The current rules apply differently depending on the way the business activity is structured and whether the business is a resident or a non-resident taxpayer. 7.20 It is suggested that most of these distinctions be removed (resident and non- resident mining operators). However, the rule that deals with mining assets transferred under a relationship property agreement should be retained. In these cases, the asset will be deemed to transfer at book value and the transferee is assessed on any profit made on the subsequent disposal of the mining asset. This occurs as if the mining asset was sold by the transferor. Timing of changes 7.21 Reforms improving efficiency should be implemented as quickly as possible, since their deferral would also defer the economic benefits of the reform. Transitional measures may be justified on efficiency grounds to effect a smooth reallocation of resources. Such measures can also be justified on equity grounds when the loss suffered would otherwise be substantial, or when individuals cannot readily adjust their circumstances to minimise the impacts of the policy change. Any transitional measures must, however, achieve a significant reduction in inequities at an acceptable cost in terms of deferral or reduction of the efficiency gains. 7.22 There appears to be no strong efficiency or equity arguments for a gradual phase-out of the concessions or for other transitional measures. Further, it would not be appropriate to grandparent mining operations that exist at the time the new rules are introduced. Expenditure incurred before the new rules would have received the benefits of immediate deductions and, in this sense, there is nothing to grandparent. Expenditure on new assets associated with existing mines should be subject to the suggested new rules as this promotes more efficient investment decisions. 26 7.23 Royalties, on the other hand, can be regarded as a contract between the Government and miners. Therefore, grandparenting current royalty treatment for mining investment can be justified. 7.24 Accordingly, it is suggested that the changes suggested in this paper apply from the beginning of the 2014–15 income year. This provides a short period of time for mining companies to gear-up for the new rules. 7.25 However, tax losses created under the current concessionary regime should continue to be subject to the current (more restricted) grouping and loss rules. The loss rules are intended to balance the more concessionary specified mineral mining rules. Therefore, for consistency, and to avoid revenue risks, losses created under the current rules should be subject to the more restrictive grouping and loss rules. 7.26 New losses created under the new rules would be subject to ordinary tax grouping and loss rules.

A second important aspect is the comprehensive recognition of those various cash and non-cash returns to labour when determining eligibility for social assistance. 1.3 This issues paper discusses ways in which the current tax rules can be broadened in this regard. Views of employers and employees are sought on the suggested changes presented in this paper. The suggested approach 1.4 Taking as our starting point that salary and salary substitutes should be taxed equally, ideally we would want to tax all material benefits that are salary substitutes. This is largely achieved under current tax legislation with salary and wages being treated as employment income, and subject to PAYE, and most non-cash benefits received as a result of employment treated as fringe benefits, and subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). 1 There are, however, a few long-standing exceptions. 1.5 While these exceptions, in the form of FBT exemptions, can result in employees receiving material untaxed benefits, their removal, based on past experience, would likely be contentious. This is partly because of the resulting valuation and compliance cost issues and partly because of the sensitivities associated with the exemptions themselves. The exemptions that are particularly relevant in this context are car parks and childcare provided on the employer’s premises, and benefits received by employees of charitable organisations. 1.6 In these circumstances we have decided to focus primarily on those situations where salary substitution is more evident, such as when an amount of salary has been traded off or given up for non-cash benefits (referred to as a salary trade-off). In other words, there is a cash alternative to taking up the benefit. For the purposes of this issues paper, it is suggested that those amounts be made taxable. Implicit trade-offs, when the amount of the salary alternative is not specifically identified but the employee has an enforceable right to the benefit, would also be included to address the behavioural shift that could otherwise potentially arise. 1 Similarly, employer contributions to an employee’s superannuation fund are subject to employer contribution superannuation tax. 2 1.7 Crucially, this focus on salary trade-off situations also helps in achieving the policy objective of enhancing the integrity of key social assistance programmes. The focus in this regard is on Working for Families tax credits, the parental income test for student allowances, some recipients of community services cards (programmes based on “family scheme income”) and child support obligations. Budget 2010 made a number of changes to arrive at a better measure of the economic income available to a family (referred to as “family scheme income”) when determining eligibility for social assistance. 2 Including salary trade-offs would take this a step further by covering another form of economic income. 1.8 Some non-cash benefits, such as employer-provided accommodation, are automatically included in “family scheme income” as they are part of an employee’s taxable income. However, fringe benefits are generally not included because they are taxed in the hands of the employer. 3 Including salary trade-offs would mean that these fringe benefits would be included in family scheme income when salary has been traded off for them. Certain benefits that are currently outside the FBT net would also be included to the extent of any salary trade-off. 1.9 Limiting change to salary trade-off situations is consistent with the approach outlined in the August 2010 officials’ issues paper, Social assistance integrity: defining family income. That approach is that changes should not include (for social assistance purposes) economic income that is not reasonably available to meet family needs. Chapter 3 discusses the definition of “family scheme income”. Benefits of this approach 1.10 Overall, the changes suggested in this issues paper should achieve a more equitable and efficient outcome. 1.11 Applying a more neutral treatment between salary and salary trade-offs lessens the likelihood of tax-driven economic behaviour. There are economic efficiency gains from reducing the tax incentive to provide non- cash remuneration and the associated reduction in the attractiveness of activities that lend themselves to high non-cash benefit remuneration. 1.12 Neutrality also means greater equity as employees enjoying equivalent remuneration packages pay equivalent tax and, all other things being equal, receive equivalent social assistance, regardless of the package’s composition. 2 In addition, the Government’s 2010 discussion document, Supporting children canvassed the idea of broadening the definition of income for child support purposes and this has been incorporated in the Child Support Amendment Bill introduced in 2011. 3 Budget 2010 brought attributable fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees who control a company within the social assistance income net. The officials’ issues paper, Social assistance integrity: defining family income released in August 2010, however, noted that there was scope for including an even wider range of fringe benefits. 3 1.13 Focusing on salary trade-offs also addresses a long-standing issue with the current boundary used to determine whether the provision of a car park is or is not a fringe benefit. That boundary has traditionally been whether the car park is on the employer’s premises, with “premises” being based on the interpretation of common law so that a leased car park, like one that is owned by the employer, is exempt from FBT whereas a licensed car park is not. There are, however, arguments that some licensed car parks would also qualify for an exemption, which would make the boundary hard to identify. Under the suggested salary trade-off approach, this distinction would be removed. All car parks and childcare benefits would be excluded from the on-premises FBT exemption and instead only be taxable when part of a salary trade-off. How might a salary trade-off rule be applied? 1.14 There are two ways that a salary trade-off rule could be designed. Both are intended to achieve the same overall tax and social assistance result. Option 1 – PAYE approach 1.15 The first option is to apply the approach comprehensively to all salary trade- offs, not just those where the underlying benefit provided by the employer is currently untaxed, and to tax the salary trade-off in the hands of the employee through PAYE. This would mean that all salary trade-offs would automatically count as income when determining eligibility to a range of social assistance programmes. Under this option, to ensure that the amount is not double taxed when the underlying benefit is subject to FBT, the salary trade-off amount (net of PAYE) in relation to those benefits, would also be treated as an employee contribution when assessing the employer’s FBT liability. Option 2 – FBT approach 1.16 The second option is to target the salary trade-off rule only to certain currently FBT-exempt benefits, being predominantly car parks and childcare provided on the employer’s premises and benefits received by employees of charitable organisations. FBT would be applied to such trade-off amounts. 1.17 This approach would then require an employer to advise each employee of the amount of all fringe benefits provided to that employee when there has been a salary trade-off. Employees would then include those amounts in their “family scheme income” calculations. 1.18 An appropriate minimum value threshold would be included to ensure that the results are the same whether taxed as salary and wages or under the FBT rules. 4 1.19 This issues paper seeks the views of employers and employees on the relative merits, including compliance costs, of these two options, and whether some combination of the elements of each option could be preferable. Charitable organisations 1.20 Although non-cash benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations currently have a general exemption from FBT, the salary trade- off approach would be applied to such benefits too. This would therefore limit the general exemption rather than replace it. 1.21 Additionally, legislative clarification is suggested in relation to the general exemption. Various arrangements are being marketed to charitable organisations, such as the provision of vouchers, which in effect aim to extend the scope of the exemption to cover an employee’s normal everyday living expenses. Because these types of arrangements provide such a readily substitutable alternative to salary and wages, and there is argument over whether they are taxable, they could cause a material risk to the tax base. Consequently, a wider response than focussing on salary-trade-offs is suggested in such cases, which is that these types of arrangements be more explicitly excluded from the FBT exemption for benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations. 1.22 A change is also suggested to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act), to ensure that non-profit bodies, like other employers, pay GST output tax on the fringe benefits they provide. The reason that output tax should be charged is that the benefits amount to private consumption by the employee. Non-profit bodies are already able to claim GST input tax credits on the goods and services acquired to provide such benefits. Other changes to family scheme income 1.23 There is a strong argument for extending the definition of “family scheme income” to include all near-cash equivalent fringe benefits received by employees, not just when those benefits are part of a salary trade-off. Such facilities provide a very ready means by which a family can meet its living expenses. Accordingly, one of the suggested changes in this issues paper is to include all employer-provided short-term charge facilities and vouchers in “family scheme income”. 5 Summary of suggested changes Tax  When an amount of salary has been traded off for non-cash benefits that are not currently taxable, the amount traded off would be made taxable.  Views are sought on two possible mechanisms for achieving this that also have regard to the objective of expanding “income” for social assistance purposes to include traded-off benefits: 1. taxing all salary trade-offs in the hands of the employee through applying PAYE to the trade-off amounts. To ensure that the amount is not double- taxed when the underlying benefit is already subject to FBT, the salary trade-off amount net of PAYE would be treated as an employee contribution when assessing the employer’s FBT liability; or 2. targeting the salary trade-off rule only to certain currently FBT-exempt benefits, being predominantly car parks and childcare provided on the employer’s premises and benefits received by employees of charitable organisations. FBT would be applied to such trade-off amounts.  Changes to the FBT rules would be made to: 1. consequently exclude all car parks and childcare benefits from the on- premises FBT exemption and instead separately subject the benefits to either PAYE or FBT but only to the extent that they are part of a salary trade-off; and 2. make it clear that the benefit of arrangements involving vouchers are excluded from the FBT exemption that charitable organisations have for non-cash benefits provided to their employees.  Changes to the GST rules would be made to ensure that non-profit bodies pay GST output tax on the fringe benefits they provide. Social assistance  Salary trade-offs would be included in “family scheme income”. Depending on the mechanism chosen to achieve the tax changes, this would be largely achieved by either including all salary trade-off amounts in the employee’s taxable income, or would require an extension of the definition of “family scheme income” to include all salary trade-off amounts attributed to them under the FBT rules.  The definition of “family scheme income” would be extended to include all employer-provided short-term charge facilities and vouchers, not just when those benefits are part of a salary trade-off or received by an employee of a charitable organisation. 6 Application date 1.24 The above tax changes would apply from 1 April 2014, with the changes being included in a tax bill later this year. Any changes to the parental income test for student allowances would be given effect by amending the Student Allowances Regulations 1998.

It suggests, subject to certain provisos, that such amounts should be taxed if they are part of a salary trade-off. Two options are discussed on how this might be achieved. 2.2 Changes to the FBT rules are also considered that would:  exclude all car park and childcare benefits from the on-premises FBT exemption and instead, depending on the mechanism chosen, separately subject these benefits to either PAYE or FBT when they are part of a salary trade-off; and  remove the benefit of arrangements involving vouchers from the FBT exemption that may be available to charitable organisations in respect of non-cash benefits provided to their employees. Current issues 2.3 Conceptually, anything that an employer provides to an employee that could be considered to be a substitute for salary and wages ought to be made taxable when it is of material value. We appreciate, however, that there are practical limitations. Based on past experience, the wholesale removal of certain FBT exemptions (such as that for on-premises car parks) would likely be contentious, partly because of resulting valuation and compliance cost concerns and partly because of the sensitivities associated with the exemptions themselves. 2.4 In these circumstances we have decided to focus primarily on situations of evident salary substitution, such as when the employee has been given a cash alternative to the benefit and equivalent situations. When salary has effectively been forgone, the tax treatment of those amounts should be aligned as much as possible with the tax treatment of salary and wages. 2.5 Currently, salary and wages are treated as employment income, and subject to PAYE, while most non-cash benefits received as a result of employment are treated as fringe benefits, and subject to FBT. 4 This means that although amounts that are included in a salary trade-off may not be directly taxed as salary and wages, they are in many instances indirectly taxed through the tax treatment that applies to the benefits received. 4 A brief outline of the FBT rules is provided in the Appendix. 8 2.6 There are, however, instances when some salary substitutes, or the equivalent amount of salary or wages that has been traded off, are not taxed. Examples include the salary traded off for an employer-provided car park or childcare benefits when these benefits are provided on the employer’s premises, 5 and benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations as part of a salary trade-off. 6 Another example could be an employer payment in respect of a group life insurance policy, when part of a salary trade-off. 2.7 It is difficult to justify these trade-off situations being tax exempt on tax policy grounds when it is considered that the amounts would be taxed if provided as cash remuneration. 2.8 The exemption gives rise to equity and efficiency issues. A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity: ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. By being untaxed on the salary trade-off, and therefore choosing to receive part of their remuneration in kind, the employee receives a tax saving over other employees who may receive the same overall salary package but are fully taxed on their total remuneration through either, or a combination of, the PAYE system or the FBT system. This is not equitable. 2.9 In practice, the benefits of this subsidy or tax incentive that the Government is in effect providing are likely to be shared between the employer and the employee. To the extent that the employer pays less for their labour because of the tax exemption, it changes the relative price of labour and encourages the employer to over-invest in labour and under-invest in capital equipment. This is economically inefficient. 2.10 A more equitable and economically efficient outcome, including a lower likelihood of behavioural distortions, can be achieved by reducing this uneven tax treatment. This would enhance the integrity of the tax system. Taxing benefits that form part of a salary trade-off 2.11 The suggested solution is, therefore, to tax amounts that are currently not taxed when they are part of a salary trade-off (which, as discussed later in this chapter, includes both explicit and implicit trade-offs). 2.12 This could be achieved by either:  including the amount of salary traded off in the employee’s income and applying PAYE. This would be through a general rule covering all salary trade-offs, even those where the underlying benefits are already subject to FBT. To avoid double taxation, employers would be able when calculating their FBT liability, to treat those salary trade-off amounts (net of PAYE), to the extent that the underlying benefits are 5 See section CX 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 under which benefits provided on the premises of the employer are specifically excluded from FBT. Premises of a person include premises that a person owns or leases. 6 FBT applies only when the employment consists of the carrying on by the charitable organisation of a business whose activity is outside its benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. 9 subject to FBT, as a contribution paid by the employee. 7 This would reduce and in many cases remove the relevant FBT liability; or  through a rule confined just to salary trade-offs involving specific currently FBT-exempt benefits, being car parks or childcare provided on the employer’s premises, and certain fringe benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations. FBT would be applied to the salary trade-off amounts. 8 2.13 Either option could be set up to largely achieve the same overall tax results, with appropriate minimum value thresholds to ensure this. Consequently, key in deciding which option is preferable, is which one imposes the least compliance cost while achieving the other key objective of ensuring that the amounts are taken into account when determining eligibility for various social assistance programmes. Submissions on which option is preferred would be welcomed. Option 1 – PAYE approach 2.14 While some may argue that an approach that subjected all salary trade-offs to PAYE would be too comprehensive, in practice it would, like the targeted approach, only affect those FBT-exempt benefits where an employee has been prepared to trade off salary and, therefore, are presumed to have some value to the employee. This is because of the square-up that would offset salary trade-off amounts when the underlying benefits are already subject to FBT, against the employer’s FBT liability in relation to those benefits. 2.15 There would be an additional compliance cost on employers through their having to do this square-up, which would need to be done for each FBT return-period. 2.16 On the other hand, since the salary trade-offs would be income to the employee and therefore automatically included in their social assistance income calculations, the employer would not need to separately advise employees, for social assistance calculation purposes, of the value of the underlying attributed fringe benefits and associated fringe benefit tax included in the salary trade-offs. This aspect is discussed more fully in chapter 3. Option 2 – FBT approach 2.17 The second option would require only certain currently FBT-exempt benefits to be brought within the FBT net, when they are part of a salary trade-off. 7 In accordance with section RD 54(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. An adjustment to the rules that already treat some non-cash benefits, such as employer-provided accommodation, as income of the employee may also be necessary to clarify that the same amount is not taxed again when a salary trade-off is involved. 8 An alternative would be to tax such specific amounts (on a grossed-up basis) as employment income and subject to PAYE. 10 2.18 Under this option, employers would need to advise employees of all the fringe benefits that have been attributed to them as part of the salary trade-off (together with the associated FBT) so that if applicable, they can include the amount in their social assistance calculations. This should be able to be obtained from the information that employers currently compile for the purposes of attributing fringe benefits to the relevant employees. This information would be particularly crucial in the case of implicit salary trade- offs (discussed below) as employees may not have information on what value their employers have ascribed to such trade-offs. 2.19 The Tax Credits Registration form – FS l – that employees complete when applying for Working for Families tax credits would need to be expanded to include these fringe benefits, as it currently only covers fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees who hold voting interests of 50 percent or more in their respective companies. Employees would also need to obtain information from employers at year-end, or even during the year, if the value of the fringe benefits received differs from that expected when the employee completed the FS 1 form at the beginning of the year. 2.20 Providing the extra information to employees would be an additional compliance cost relative to the PAYE option. On the other hand, there would not be a need to square-up salary trade-offs with FBT liabilities under this option, given that the benefits being targeted would not be subject to FBT. 2.21 The FBT approach may be easier to apply to salary trade-offs provided by charitable organisations given the range of exemptions in the FBT rules which would need to be reflected in the minimum value thresholds in the PAYE approach as discussed below. In the case of charitable organisations, this FBT option would involve a narrowing of the current FBT exemption for benefits provided to their employees. On the other hand, the tax would be imposed directly on charitable organisations which would have to put FBT systems in place rather than just extend their use of PAYE systems. Minimum values 2.22 Under the PAYE option it may be appropriate to have a minimum value threshold specific to aggregate salary trade-offs involving what would be unclassified or other exempt benefits under the FBT rules. A suggested threshold is $1,800 per annum (equivalent to that in the FBT rules, after including tax, 9 for low-value unclassified benefits). This would be to avoid these amounts being taxed under the PAYE rules when they have been exempted from FBT. The threshold would be limited to implicit salary trade-off situations on the basis that if an employee has accepted an explicit trade-off, it is assumed that the employee has decided that the benefits are of sufficient value to them and, therefore, the amount of salary traded off (irrespective of the trade-off value) should be taxable. We are seeking the public’s views on whether this approach is appropriate, and whether the minimum value threshold should be extended to explicit salary trade-off situations. 9 The FBT threshold is $1,200 per annum, with the maximum FBT rate being 49.25%. 11 Example comparing PAYE and FBT approaches Employee A, is offered a salary trade-off involving the following non-cash benefits: Salary traded off Equivalent benefit value  car $14,925 $10,000  car park $ 3,731 $ 2,500  childcare $ 7,462 $ 5,000  health insurance $ 2,985 $ 2,000  low interest loan $ 4,478 $ 3,000 $33,581 $22,500 His salary is $80,000 in cash plus the above benefits. 10 Under the PAYE approach Salary trade-offs total $33,581, which would be treated as income of employee A. The trade- offs for a car park would be included as the salary traded off of $3,731 (equivalent benefit value of the trade-off being $2,500) is more than the $1,800 minimum value (which is equivalent to an underlying benefit of $1,200). PAYE on the additional income is: $33,581 x 0.33 = $11,081. The $33,581 in additional income would automatically count as “family scheme income” for social assistance purposes. FBT adjustment The car park and childcare benefit are exempt from FBT under this approach so the amounts of salary traded off for them would not be included in the FBT adjustment. Salary traded off where underlying benefit subject to FBT = $14,925 + 2,985 + 4,478 = $22,388. Fringe benefits as calculated under the FBT rules = $10,000 (car) + $2,000 (health insurance) + $3,000 (low interest loan) = $15,000. (In this example the equivalent benefit value matches the value of the fringe benefit under the FBT rules.) Value of employee’s contribution for FBT purposes is $22,388 (this is the sum of the amount of salary traded off for the car, health insurance and low-interest loan). $22,388 less tax = $22,388 x 0.67 = $15,000. Fringe benefit value less value of employee’s contribution = $15,000 – $15,000 = $0. 10 This example does not take into account ACC earner premium on salary and wages. 12 Under the FBT approach Under this approach, the value of the underlying benefits in the salary traded off for the car park and childcare would be treated as a fringe benefit and subject to FBT. If the value of the benefit has not been identified in an explicit trade-off, then the underlying benefit value will be calculated from the amount of salary traded off, by deducting the tax at the employee’s marginal tax rate. In the above example the assumed underlying values are $2,500 + $5,000 = $7,500. This would be added to the other fringe benefits (car, health insurance and low-interest loan), which total $15,000. Total fringe benefits = $22,500. FBT on those fringe benefits = $22,500 x 0.4925 = $11,081. This FBT liability is the same as the additional PAYE under the PAYE approach. The employer will need to advise employee A of the fringe benefits and FBT that have been attributed to him as part of the salary trade-off, so that employee A can include the amount in any social assistance calculations. Employee A would, therefore, include $33,581 ($22,500 + $11,081) in his “family scheme income”. Implication for the FBT rules 2.23 The focus on salary trade-off situations is not a signal of a more general change of approach to the taxing of fringe benefits. As noted in chapter 1, this approach is being adopted in recognition of the contentious nature of past suggestions in relation to the currently untaxed key benefits, and the proposal in effect represents a compromise approach to obtaining certainty in these areas and a more equitable and efficient approach overall. 2.24 Although it is recognised that FBT gives rise to its own compliance costs, particularly for employers, it is still considered to be an effective tax for buttressing the taxation of salary and wages by reducing the incentive to provide remuneration through benefits rather than cash. This review is not intending to change the current general approach to determining what constitutes a fringe benefit, and fringe benefits will continue to be taxed under the FBT rules. Salary trade-off defined 2.25 The risk with focussing on pure salary trade-offs involving the sacrifice of a specific amount of salary for a specific benefit, rather than on all material situations when the underlying benefits are provided, is that economic decision-making could be affected – for example, contracts could be altered over time to provide benefits outside of explicit salary trade-offs. Some employees could still receive the benefits on an untaxed basis. To some extent, employment relationships may reduce these risks, particularly if an employer has a large number of employees. These risks can be further ameliorated through the way in which a “salary trade-off” is defined. 13 2.26 We envisage a “salary trade-off” being defined to include:  an amount of salary or wages that is traded off for a non-cash benefit;  any other income related to employment and payable in money that is traded off for a non-cash benefit; and  any attributed or currently untaxed benefit for FBT purposes that is offered to a group or class of employees not involving an explicit trade- off for salary or wages, where the employee has an enforceable right to the benefit and has taken up the benefit. The benefit must also be available to the employee. We refer to this as an implicit salary or wage trade-off. 2.27 This broader definition recognises that not all salary trade-offs involve the employee actively choosing to forgo an amount of salary in exchange for the benefits. A group or class of employees may be offered non-cash benefits outside of an explicit salary trade-off, similar to those offered under a salary trade-off but with no cash alternative being offered to those that do not wish to take up the benefit. For equity and base-protection reasons, we consider that the proposed new rule needs to cover these implicit salary trade-off situations provided the employee has an enforceable right to the benefit and has taken up the benefit. 2.28 The requirement that the employee has an enforceable right means that the benefit will have been either specified in an employment agreement or in documentation 11 associated with an employment agreement rather than being provided by the employer as an incidental perk or on a casual basis. Limiting the requirement this way is intended to reflect that the employee is more likely to consider it to be of value, particularly if the employee has taken up the option. The agreement may even ascribe a value to it. Likewise, the requirement that the benefit has to have been taken up is to ensure that employees are not taxed on terms in their employment agreements that they do not take up, presumably on the basis that there is minimal value to them. The requirement that the benefit has to be available for use ensures that the employee is not affected if the benefit is unable to be provided by the employer as might be the case for a car park in the central business district red zone in Christchurch. Value of trade-off 2.29 The value of the salary trade-off would, in most cases, be the amount of employment income traded off for the benefit. 2.30 If there was an implicit salary trade-off, the employer would need to ascribe a value to that trade-off for those employees who had chosen to take up the offer. We acknowledge that valuing the benefit may be more readily achievable in some cases than in others – for example, it may be the amount paid by the employer to a third-party providing the benefit but in other cases another valuation mechanism will be needed. A standard value could be considered to ease compliance costs in such cases. 11 Which could include material on employers’ internal electronic websites. 14 2.31 Given these valuation issues, submissions are also sought on alternative ways in which the risks and costs associated with implicit salary trade-offs might be mitigated. Salary trade-off examples Example 1: Explicit salary trade-off Business Co offers all of its senior executives one of the following salary packages, either: • $85,000 cash salary and a car-parking space for private car-parking; or • $90,000 cash salary. Senior executives are given the choice between a cash salary or trading off some of that salary for a non-cash benefit. This is an example of an explicit salary trade-off. The value of the salary traded off car park would be $5,000. Example 2: Implicit salary trade-off Office Co has 10 car-parking spaces in the basement of its building. Although the car-parking spaces are unallocated, the spaces are offered to the 10 managers working for Office Co for private parking their motor vehicles. The car park is available for the managers to use at any time, and each manager is guaranteed a parking space. In other words, they have an enforceable right to the benefit. This example would be covered under the suggested salary trade-off rule. Example 3: Not a salary trade-off situation Hammer and Nails hardware store has a car park on its business premises. The car park is available for general customer parking. However, employees of Hammer and Nails can use this car park for their own private parking, on a “first-in, first-served” basis if there is a parking space available. This example would not be covered under the suggested rule change as the employees would not have an enforceable right to the benefit. Similarly, teachers at Midtown secondary school are able to park their cars on the netball courts in the school grounds. However, the netball courts are only available for use as a car park on the days that the school does not use the courts for physical education activities – typically one or two days per week. The school grounds are open from 8am to 5pm during the school term, and are closed at all times during the weekends and school holidays. In this situation, the teachers would not have an enforceable right to a car-parking benefit. This is because car-parking spaces for teachers’ cars are only available at specific times, and on certain days during the year. Moreover, when car-parking is available, a space is not guaranteed to them. 15 Example 4: Employees of charitable organisations Megan is an employee at Charitable Org, earning $70,000 cash salary per annum. On top of this cash salary, Charitable Org offers Megan the following benefits as part of her salary package: Equivalent benefit value Salary traded off Credit/debit card $5,000 $7,463 Car park $2,000 $2,985 Childcare benefit $2,500 $3,731 Total $9,500 $14,179 Current approach Under the current rules, only the provision of the credit card to Megan would be taxable under the FBT rules. FBT on this benefit would be: 5,000 x 0.4925 = $2,463. The provision of the car park and childcare facility (whether it is on- or off- premises) would fall under the general FBT exemption for benefits provided by a charitable organisation to its employees. Suggested new approach Under the PAYE approach Under the PAYE approach, the $14,179 in salary trade-offs would be included in Megan’s income, and this amount would be automatically treated as “family scheme income” for Megan’s social assistance purposes. PAYE on the traded off salary would be: $14,179 x 0.33 = $4,679. FBT adjustment An FBT adjustment would be required to ensure that the amount is not double-taxed when the underlying benefit is already subject to FBT. The adjustment would work by treating the salary traded off amount (net of PAYE) as an employee contribution when assessing the employer’s liability for FBT. This means that the credit/debit card benefit provided to Megan will need to be included in the FBT adjustment. The salary traded off for the car park and the childcare benefit would not be included as they would be exempt from FBT. The FBT value of the debit/credit card benefit is: $5,000. The value of the employee contribution for FBT purposes would therefore be the salary traded off when the underlying benefit is subject to FBT: $7,463 (credit/debit card). $7,463 less tax would be: $7,463 x 0.67 = $5,000. The FBT value less value of employee contribution would be: $5,000 - $5,000 = $0. 16 Under the FBT approach This approach targets non-cash benefits that form part of a salary trade-off and are currently FBT-exempt. For Megan, this approach would treat the value of her employer-provided car park and childcare benefit as a fringe benefit and subject to FBT, because it forms part of her salary trade-off. The underlying value of Megan’s car-parking and childcare benefits is: $2,000 + $2,500 = $4,500. An FBT adjustment, like the one undertaken under the PAYE approach, would not be needed given that the only benefits being targeted under this approach are currently FBT-exempt. Megan’s car-parking and childcare benefit would then be added to other salary traded-off attributable fringe benefits in her package: $4,500 (car-parking and childcare) + $5,000 (credit/debit card) = $9,500. Total fringe benefits = $9,500. FBT on fringe benefits: $9,500 x 0.4925 = $4,679. The total FBT collected on Megan’s salary traded-off benefits under the FBT approach is the same as the PAYE collected under the PAYE approach. Megan’s employer would need to advise her of the fringe benefits and FBT that have been attributed to her as part of her salary trade-off. This is so Megan can include the amount in her social assistance calculations. Implications for on-premises exemption – car parks and childcare 2.32 The changes we are suggesting would also provide an important opportunity to address a long-standing issue with the current boundary used to determine whether the provision of a car park is a fringe benefit. 2.33 One of the key determinants of whether an employer-provided car park is a fringe benefit is whether the benefit is enjoyed on the premises of the employer. What constitutes “premises” of the employer is based on the common law distinction between a lease and a licence – the former being exempt and the latter being taxable on the basis that a lease, like ownership, provides an exclusive right of possession. Therefore, a car-parking benefit provided to an employee as part of his or her remuneration is taxable if the benefit is provided on licensed premises of the employer, but is exempt if provided on the employer’s leased premises. 2.34 The same test applies to employer-provided childcare facilities. Some employers offer or arrange childcare facilities for their employees to assist their participation in the workforce. Whether FBT applies to these benefits is determined by whether they are provided on the employer’s premises. 17 2.35 Regardless of their legal character, from a policy perspective, the tax treatment of these benefits should be the same when it provides the employee with the same private benefit. 2.36 Furthermore, the lease/licence boundary has become increasingly difficult to sustain in relation to car parks, with some interpretations of the current tax provision tending to suggest that the boundary is not so clear-cut, and that conceivably some types of licensed car parks that provide substantially exclusive possession also qualify for the exemption. 2.37 Accordingly, it is suggested that this distinction be removed so that car parks and childcare benefits be excluded from the on-premises FBT exemption. Instead, the boundary would be based on the more general approach of whether there had been a salary trade-off for the benefit(s). If so, the amount of salary traded off would be taxable either in the hands of the employee, through the deduction of PAYE, or in the hands of the employer, through applying FBT. If the benefit is not salary traded off, it would be excluded from the fringe benefit tax rules. Implications for charitable organisations 2.38 The suggested approach would potentially affect charitable organisations and their employees as, like other employers, charitable organisations may offer their staff some form of non-cash benefit. This may, either implicitly or explicitly, involve a salary trade-off. 12 2.39 Currently, these benefits are generally tax-exempt. They are exempt from income tax, and FBT does not apply other than when the employees are employed in the organisation’s business activities – for example, when a charity operates a manufacturing or retail business. For the purposes of the FBT exemption, charitable organisations are defined widely to include entities and funds set up for benevolent, charitable, cultural or philanthropic purposes. This definition, however, specifically excludes local and public authorities, and universities. A salary trade-off rule would in effect narrow this general exemption, but the benefits provided outside of a salary trade-off would still be tax exempt. 13 2.40 In addition to applying a salary trade-off rule, a legislative clarification to the FBT exemption should in our view be made to remove any doubt that vouchers are excluded from the exemption, for the reasons explained below. 12 Recent survey data indicates that the most common form of non-cash benefit provided by not for profit bodies involves some provision of a motor vehicle, with 8 percent of the employees of the survey respondents being provided with that benefit. This benefit could range from provision for pure private use to provision for home to work travel. Other non-cash benefits noted in the survey included employer provided or paid club/professional fees (received by 3 percent of employees in the survey), medical insurance (2 percent) and car parks (2 percent). 13 The exemption would be directly narrowed if the FBT approach were adopted as the charitable organisation would pay FBT on the salary traded-off benefits whereas under the PAYE approach the exemption would not be altered but the employee would pay the tax, which would indirectly narrow the exemption. However, irrespective of whether the tax is paid by way of FBT or PAYE, who ultimately bears the tax will depend on the circumstances and each party’s bargaining power. 18 2.41 These suggested changes would not affect the FBT treatment of benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations who do not qualify for the current exemption, in other words, those employees who are employed in a business whose activities are outside the charitable organisation’s benevolent, charitable, cultural, or philanthropic purposes. Their benefits would remain fully subject to FBT. Charities and the FBT exemption 2.42 Successive governments have provided a range of financial assistance measures to charitable organisations. This assistance has increased in recent years through, for example, the removal of the cap on the donations rebate. 14 These forms of government support are based on the concept that the services that charitable organisations provide are complementary to the programmes that the Government provides as part of its social objectives, and assist in furthering those objectives. This form of assistance can also result in a better targeting of resources compared with simply increasing state provision in these areas, as the donations people make to a charitable organisation are an indicator of the causes that people feel need their support. Subsidising charities through the income tax exemption ensures that those members of society who do not donate to charitable organisations but who nevertheless benefit indirectly from them contribute through their general tax payments. 15 Hence there are good reasons for the Government providing some form of tax assistance to charitable organisations. 2.43 However, unlike the expanded rebate for donations and the income tax exemption for charities, providing additional assistance through an FBT exemption can give rise to the efficiency and equity issues referred to earlier. For example, because other entities do not have such a broad FBT exemption, it may provide a charitable organisation with a competitive advantage both in terms of attracting employees and when competing with other entities to provide services. To the extent that the FBT exemption attracts employees away from other organisations, it may be economically inefficient as it can enable the tax-exempt entity to expand at the expense of non-exempt entities. 16 2.44 While there may be debate about the size of the equity and efficiency losses and the extent to which the offsetting benefits provided by charities should be taken into account, the distortions have the potential to grow as there will always be an incentive for further fringe benefits to be substituted for cash remuneration, increasing the relative tax advantage. Any further salary substitution also reduces the tax base. 14 A recent study commissioned by Philanthropy NZ and undertaken by BERL, indicates that charitable giving, particularly by individuals, has increased significantly over the past five years. As regards the income tax exemption this is estimated, based on Charities Commission data, to be worth at least $300 million per annum. 15 For further discussion on this point see Tax and charities, a government discussion document, June 2001 (available on www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz). 16 Possible examples of this could be teachers in private schools that are charities receiving untaxed non-cash benefits. Those same benefits, if provided to teachers in state schools, would be subject to FBT. Likewise, benefits provided to university staff are specifically not exempt but benefits provided to staff of other tertiary institutions may face the legal uncertainty over whether polytechnics, colleges of education and wananga are public authorities. 19 2.45 The general suggestion to tax salary trade-offs provides a step towards achieving an overall more equitable and efficient outcome across the variety of returns to labour services. However, we consider that it is necessary to go a step further in the case of the charitable organisations’ FBT exemption. 2.46 When the exemption was last considered in the 2003–05 review of FBT, the then Government concluded the exemption should not be extended 17 but rather be limited to exclude short-term charge facilities 18 whose value exceeds 5 percent of an employee’s salary. The key concern was that such facilities were a close cash-equivalent when they could be used to purchase items that all employees want, such as groceries. 2.47 More recently, there has been further testing of the boundaries of the exemption, with a number of entities marketing schemes to charities that involve offering employees more of their remuneration package in non- taxable benefits. This might be achieved, for example, through the provision of vouchers which cover employees’ normal everyday living expenses. 2.48 Arguably, vouchers may be excluded from the exemption on the basis that they are a short-term charge facility but it would be preferable to put this beyond doubt. Our concern is that because these types of arrangements provide such a readily substitutable alternative to salary and wages (and there is argument over whether they are taxable), they could pose a material risk to the tax base. 2.49 The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines a voucher as “a document which can be exchanged for goods or services as a token of payment made or promised by the holder or another”. Hence, like money, a voucher is a store of wealth and, although it may not always be transferable to others, is a medium of exchange. Suggested change to exemption in relation to vouchers 2.50 In the case of vouchers, we are suggesting a legislative clarification to confirm these types of arrangements are clearly excluded from the FBT exemption. FBT would therefore explicitly apply to the provision of arrangements involving vouchers consistent with the current exclusion of short-term charge facilities. 17 The exemption has been part of the FBT rules since their inception in 1985, although it was removed for a brief period in 1990. Since then, various reviews have considered the exemption’s merits and whether it should be retained. 18 Defined in section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act to be an arrangement that – (a) enables an employee of a charitable organisation to obtain goods and services that have no connection with the organisation or its operations by buying or hiring the goods or services or charging the cost of the goods or services to an account; and (b) places the liability for some or all of the payment for the goods or services on the organisation; and (c) is not a fringe benefit that is an employment-related loan. 20 2.51 If such an arrangement also involved a salary trade-off and the PAYE approach becomes the mechanism for implementing the salary trade-off rule, the amount of salary traded off would be treated as income of the employee (and subject to income tax), with the employer treating the net of tax amount as an employee payment, 19 to reduce or even eliminate the fringe benefit and associated FBT liability. Defining “voucher” 2.52 We would envisage adopting a wide definition of “voucher”, similar to that used overseas. In Australia, a “voucher” is defined as a voucher, token, stamp (but not a postage stamp), coupon or similar article, or a prepaid phone card or facility which, in each case, has a stated monetary value and which is redeemable for other supplies in accordance with its terms. 2.53 Likewise, United Kingdom tax legislation adopts a very wide definition of a non-cash voucher. It includes not only conventional retail vouchers but also “any voucher, stamp or similar document or token”. This definition may therefore catch documents in letter form as well as plastic discs or tokens inserted into machines. Generally, the voucher needs to be capable of being exchanged for goods and services. GST and non-profit bodies 2.54 Normally for an entity to receive a GST input tax credit or deduction it must be providing taxable supplies. An exception to this taxable supply requirement is provided for non-profit bodies so that GST-registered non- profit bodies (including charities) receive GST input tax credits in relation to all of their activities, other than the making of exempt supplies (such as the sale of donated goods at a stall operated by a charity). 2.55 This means non-profit bodies can claim input tax credits on any asset that they purchase (such as a car) even if it involves providing private benefits to their employees. Other entities are generally required to pay output tax on the provision of the private benefit as fringe benefits are generally subject to output tax. The rationale for this is that the employee is in effect the final consumer in such cases. In the car example, the value of the car’s services will be consumed by the employee over a number of years, with a corresponding gradual reduction in the residual value of the vehicle. 2.56 Not applying GST output tax to the private benefit provided by a non-profit body to its employees is inconsistent with the general intent of the GST rules. Accordingly, we would suggest an amendment to the GST Act to ensure output tax applies in such cases as if a fringe benefit had been provided. In other words section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007 which excludes a private benefit provided to an employee of a charitable organisation from being a fringe benefit would be ignored when determining output tax. This would not affect non-profit bodies’ ability to claim input tax credits. 19 In accordance with section RD 54(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 21 Application date 2.57 The tax changes suggested in this chapter would apply from 1 April 2014, with the changes being included in a tax bill later this year. 22 CHAPTER 3 Recognising a wider range of fringe benefits in social assistance income 3.1 This chapter considers whether the definition of “family scheme income” needs to be widened to improve the integrity of various social assistance programmes. It concludes that fringe benefits that are part of a salary trade- off should be included in “family scheme income” as they are economic income available to meet a family’s needs. Depending on the tax mechanism adopted to apply the salary trade-off rule, these salary trade-offs would either be included automatically because they would be taxable income or employees would need to separately include them in their social assistance calculations. 3.2 There is a strong argument for extending the definition of “family scheme income” to also include all those near-cash equivalent fringe benefits received by employees, not just when those benefits are part of a salary trade-off. Accordingly, it is proposed to include employer-provided short- term charge facilities and vouchers in “family scheme income”. Such facilities provide a very ready means by which a family can meet its living expenses. Current issues 3.3 The Government provides or funds a wide range of social assistance programmes. There are various broad approaches that could be used to determine a household’s entitlement to these social assistance programmes, and the actual approach used varies across the range of programmes. 20 3.4 Entitlements and liabilities for a number of the programmes are principally based on taxable income and, as a result, the programmes are delivered through the tax system. These programmes are Working for Families, child support and student loans. A number of social assistance programmes not administered by Inland Revenue, such as student allowances and community services cards, also use taxable income as a basis for assessing entitlement. 3.5 In a number of these cases, taxable income is subject to various adjustments. The definition of “family scheme income” is an example. “Family scheme income” is used for determining a family’s entitlement to Working for Families tax credits, the parental income test for student loan purposes, and in relation to some community services card recipients. The objective of adjusting taxable income is to reflect the amount that is available to assist the family in meeting its day-to-day living expenses. Generally, the types of adjustments were relatively minor until the changes made as part of Budget 2010. 20 A number of benefits, for example, focus only on cash amounts received. 23 3.6 A social assistance programme has integrity if people receive the same level of assistance or incur the same level of liability regardless of how they structure their financial affairs. Budget 2010 highlighted that the perceived integrity of various programmes was being undermined by not taking into account all the types of income that a family might receive, so that how economic income was structured was having an important and unfair impact on social assistance entitlements. 3.7 To address these integrity concerns, Budget 2010 emphasised the need to include in family scheme income different types of economic income that had previously not been counted, with changes being made in late 2010 to broaden the definition of income for the purposes of calculating entitlements to Working for Families in particular. These changes were explained in the August 2010 officials’ issues paper, Social assistance integrity: defining family income, and were followed by legislative changes that were included in the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010. 3.8 In addition, the Government’s 2010 discussion document, Supporting children canvassed the idea of broadening the definition of income for child support purposes. Widening the definition further 3.9 One aspect that was set aside at the time of last year’s social assistance integrity review was whether a wider range of fringe benefits and FBT- exempt benefits should be included in social assistance income calculations. Currently, only attributable fringe benefits provided to shareholder- employees who control a closely held company are included. 3.10 Fringe benefits provided to other employees do not automatically count as income for social assistance purposes as the benefits are taxed in the hands of the employer. In principle, fringe benefits should be included in income for social assistance purposes if they are easily substitutable for cash or household expenditure. The availability of an employer-provided motor vehicle, for example, can save an employee substantial costs through not having to own and operate a vehicle. Some submissions on the officials’ issues paper, Social assistance integrity: defining family income supported the inclusion of fringe benefits in family scheme income. 3.11 Likewise, other material in-kind benefits, such as the provision of on- premises car parks and childcare, and benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations, that are exempt from FBT should arguably also be included in income for social assistance purposes on the basis that they contribute towards a household’s living expenses. 3.12 The exclusion of benefits from family scheme income means that employees on similar remuneration packages can receive significantly different amounts of social assistance depending on how their remuneration is structured. This not only creates inequities but also provides an incentive to receive non-cash benefits rather than salary, promoting behaviour that reduces economic efficiency. 24 3.13 There are several options for how the currently taxed and untaxed benefit amounts might be included in “family scheme income”. Option 1: Including all fringe benefits and material FBT-exempt benefits 3.14 The first option involves including in “family scheme income” all fringe benefits and material FBT-exempt benefits provided to an employee. It is the most comprehensive option. 3.15 Including all fringe benefits would impose high compliance costs, particularly on employers. The value of all benefits would need to be attributed to each employee so that the employee has the information available when applying for social assistance. This is more than is required from employers under the FBT rules. For example, pooled or lower value benefits are not required to be attributed because of the complexity of doing so. 3.16 There is also a potential equity issue if the ascribed benefits do not truly reflect contributions towards meeting a family’s day-to-day living expenses. The FBT rules endeavour to reasonably value the likely benefit that an employee derives but some employees may consider the benefit to be of less value to them than that ascribed under the FBT rules. They may not have a choice over whether they receive the fringe benefit 21 and may not be able to forgo it, yet their social assistance entitlements could be materially affected by including the benefit in their income calculation. 3.17 As with option 2 below, employers would be required to advise employees of the value of the benefits they have received (and the FBT that has been paid on those benefits) so that they could include them in their relevant social assistance income calculations. Option 2: Including only attributed benefits and material FBT-exempt benefits 3.18 A second option is to include only those benefits that are attributable to individual employees under the fringe benefit tax rules when applying the FBT multi-rate calculations, plus any material FBT-exempt benefits (car parks and childcare provided on the employer’s premises and benefits received by employees of charitable organisations). 3.19 Table 1 illustrates the rules that apply to different categories of fringe benefits, including the respective minimum values below which attribution is not required. 21 This was the reason given for including in the 2010 changes only attributable fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees who, together with associates, hold 50 percent or more of the voting interests (or market value interests if a market value circumstance exists) of the company. A major shareholder is able to arrange for a substantial proportion of their remuneration to be paid as fringe benefits instead of wages. Usually, employees who do not have a controlling interest in the company have less influence over the composition of their remuneration. 25 Table 1: Fringe benefit categories and attribution Benefit category Threshold Attribute Pool Motor vehicles None Yes except if pooled If no employee has the principal use, enjoyment or availability of the benefit Low-interest loans None Yes except if it is a low-interest loan by a life insurer to policyholders Loans by life insurers to insurance policyholders Subsidised transport (for employers in the public transport business only) Yes Attribute if annual taxable value for the employee is $1,000 or more except if all employees have the same or a similar entitlement to the benefit\* Can be pooled if all employees have the same or a similar entitlement to the benefit Employer contributions to sick, accident or death fund Yes Attribute if the annual taxable value for the employee is $1,000 or more\* Employer contributions to specified insurance funds of friendly societies Yes Attribute if the annual taxable value for the employee is $1,000 or more\* Employer contributions to any superannuation scheme where employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) does not apply Yes Attribute if the annual taxable value for the employee is $1,000 or more\* Unclassified benefits Yes Attribute if annual benefits for the employee are in aggregate $2,000 or more\* \*Note: Employers can choose to attribute all benefits within a category regardless of the category thresholds. 3.20 This would be a workable solution as it would be relatively comprehensive. 3.21 In this regard, option 2 could be seen as an extension of the approach used for major shareholder-employees where attributed fringe benefits are included in “family scheme income” because such shareholders are regarded as having influence over the composition of their remuneration. However, as with option 1, there is a potential equity issue if the ascribed benefits do not truly reflect contributions towards meeting a family’s day-to-day living expenses – for example, if an employee has an employer-provided car but also has their own car that they could just as easily be using. 3.22 Information on attribution would be available to the employer as it is required to be calculated already for FBT purposes. 22 As with option 1, there would be an additional compliance cost for the employer in providing this information (and information on the FBT that has been paid on those benefits) to employees so that they can include it in their relevant social assistance income calculations. 22 Specifically this would mean just those benefits that the employer attributes to an employee for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax rules in sections RD 47 to RD 49 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 26 Option 3: Including only those benefits that form part of a salary trade-off 3.23 Confining coverage to those benefits that are included in a salary trade-off would help to limit arguments about the true value of a benefit to a particular employee as it is more likely to reflect situations when an employee acknowledges the value of the benefit and is willing to explicitly trade off salary for it. 23 3.24 This would be similar to the Australian approach of recognising “salary sacrifices” when determining eligibility for social assistance programmes. 24 Interaction with proposed tax changes 3.25 The compliance costs for employees associated with implementing this option could be lower when it is combined with the option in chapter 2 of including all material salary trade-offs in taxable income (the PAYE option). As we have noted, the PAYE option would mean that trade-off amounts are automatically included in income for social assistance purposes, saving the employer the need to separately advise the employee of the value of the underlying attributed fringe benefits included in the salary trade-off (which would be necessary under the FBT option). Conclusion 3.26 Option 3 is our preferred approach as it best meets the objective of including benefits that meet the family’s living expenses. The question is then whether this should be achieved through the PAYE option or the FBT option, a key determinant being the overall impact on compliance costs. Extending this approach 3.27 Another tax change suggested in chapter 2 was the need for legislative clarification with regard to the exclusion of arrangements involving vouchers from the FBT exemption for charitable organisations’ employees. The key concern here is the close equivalence of vouchers and cash when vouchers can be used to purchase items that all employees are likely to want, such as groceries. A broad exclusion already applies to short-term charge facilities provided to employees of charitable organisations and arguably vouchers may come within that exclusion. However, the matter should be put beyond doubt by specifically excluding vouchers. 23 It may also reflect when the employee has explicit control over whether they receive the benefits although “control” in this context can be very subjective as employees who agree to a salary trade-off arrangement may not always have control over the make-up of their total remuneration package. Control was a reason given for including fringe benefits received by shareholder-employees of closely held companies in the 2010 changes to the definition of “income”. 24 Under the Australian approach, the grossed-up (at the top marginal tax rate) taxable value of fringe benefits is included in the employee’s annual payment summary when the benefits exceed $2,000 in aggregate. This reportable fringe benefit amount is required to be included in the employee’s tax return and is taken into account when determining eligibility for a range of social assistance programmes, including certain income-tested government benefits and child support obligations. The sacrificed amount is not, however, subject to FBT unless the benefit would normally be subject to the FBT rules. This means, for example, health promotion charities and public hospitals are not liable to FBT on benefits provided to their employees (unless the relevant thresholds are exceeded) irrespective of whether the employee has salary sacrificed in exchange for the benefit. 27 3.28 There is a strong argument for including all short-term charge and vouchers facilities in “family scheme income”, not merely when they involve a trade- off of salary, and not merely in relation to employees of charitable organisations, as they clearly provide a very ready means by which a family can meet its living expenses. A facility that enables payment of an employee’s family’s grocery bill is clearly going to be of wide appeal irrespective of whether it is explicitly included in a salary trade-off. 3.29 Accordingly, this issues paper suggests including employer-provided short- term charge and voucher facilities in “family scheme income”. This would mean that employers would need to advise their employees of those fringe benefits (and the associated FBT) arising in relation to such arrangements so that they can include them in their “family scheme income” calculations. The Tax Credits Registration form – FS l – that employees complete when applying for Working for Families tax credits would be expanded to include these fringe benefits. In such cases the fringe benefit would be the net amount after taking into account any “contribution” from the employee through salary that has been traded off. Which programmes would these changes apply to? 3.30 The social assistance programmes that these changes might apply to depends on whether the PAYE or the FBT option is implemented. Under the PAYE option the changes would apply automatically, through the employee’s taxable income incorporating the various non-cash benefits that form part of a salary trade-off, whereas under the FBT option the changes would require specific inclusion. 3.31 If the PAYE option is implemented, the changes would apply to any social assistance programmes that used taxable or net income as a basis and would include:  Working for Families  Student allowances (parental income test)  Student loans repayment obligations  Community services card (entitlements for superannuitants and families with children, other than beneficiary families)  Child support. 3.32 If the FBT option is implemented and the definition of family scheme income is amended to include salary traded off amounts, these changes would apply to Working for Families tax credits, the parental income test for student loans, community services card entitlements for families with children (other than beneficiary families) and child support calculations 25 . 25 Proposed in the Child Support Amendment Bill 2011. 28 Application date for social assistance changes 3.33 As noted in chapter 2, any changes to taxable income and the relevant FBT provisions would apply from 1 April 2014. The change to include employer- provided short-term charge facilities and vouchers in “family scheme income” would also apply from that date. Further consideration will be given to the implications for those social assistance programmes, such as student allowances, that have a calculation year other than 1 April to 31 March. 29 APPENDIX Currently taxed benefits Employee benefits that are subject to FBT are listed in the Income Tax Act 2007, along with valuation rules for a number of the benefits, most notably motor vehicles. The five main types of benefits are:  motor vehicles;  low-interest loans other than low-interest loans provided by life insurance companies to policyholders;  free, subsidised or discounted goods and services, including subsidised transport for employees in the public transport business;  employer contributions to sick, accident or death benefit funds, superannuation schemes and specified insurance policies;  a catch-all category – “unclassified benefits” received by an employee in connection with his or her employment. The catch-all provision can include any benefit of any kind received by an employee, including employment-related gifts and prizes and free, subsidised or discounted goods. A de minimis exemption may apply to fringe benefits provided in this category. In the case of unclassified benefits, minimum value thresholds apply to remove low- value benefits from any FBT impost. If the value of the unclassified benefits provided to an employee is no more than $300 in the quarter (if FBT is returned quarterly) or $1,200 (if FBT is returned annually) and total unclassified benefits provided by the employer to all employees in the year is no more than $22,500, then FBT does not apply. If the value of the benefits exceeds the thresholds, then FBT will be payable on the total value of the benefits, including any amount below the threshold. Attributed versus pooled benefits Initially there was a single rate of FBT but since April 2000 a range of rates (commonly referred to as multi-rates) has applied. Employers elect the rate of FBT to use depending on the type of return they file, the classification of the fringe benefits they provide and the marginal tax rates of the relevant employees. Applying the marginal tax rate equivalent is designed to replicate the outcome as if the benefits had been taxed directly in the hands of the employee. To achieve this most benefits are required to be attributed to an employee. In general, a fringe benefit does not need to be attributed to an employee when:  the value of the benefits falls below the threshold relevant to that type of benefit (there are no minimum value thresholds for employer-provided motor vehicles and low-interest loans); or  are required to be pooled because the benefit is shared by a number of employees and the employer cannot determine which employee mainly uses or receives the benefit.
International treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Canada for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee Contents Recommendation 2 Appendix A 3 Appendix B 4 CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 2 International treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Canada for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Recommendation The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommends that the House take note of its report. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has examined the Convention between New Zealand and Canada for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. The national interest analysis for the convention is appended to this report. The convention will replace an existing agreement with Canada that dates back to 1980. It updates the existing convention to reflect international developments and changes in each country’s treaty policy since then, to ensure that arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Canada are up-to-date and provide the degree of certainty and protection that taxpayers expect. The main change to the agreement is the reduction of withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and royalties in line with New Zealand’s wider strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the reduction in withholding rates is expected to be relatively small, at approximately half a million dollars per year. Labour members understand and accept that overseas investors into New Zealand do not receive the full range of government services paid for out of taxes, such as healthcare, and should not pay the full rates of tax paid by New Zealanders who do. Nevertheless, overseas investors do benefit from the societal settings maintained through taxation including a healthy, well-educated population, and enforcement of property rights and the rule of law. Because overseas investors do benefit from taxes, they should pay some tax, albeit at lower rates. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 3 Appendix A Committee procedure The international treaty examination of the Convention between New Zealand and Canada for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income was referred to us by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on 28 June 2012. We met on 25 July, and 1 and 2 August 2012 to consider the convention, and received advice from the Inland Revenue Department. Committee members Todd McClay (Chairperson) Maggie Barry David Bennett Dr David Clark Hon Clayton Cosgrove Paul Goldsmith John Hayes Dr Russel Norman Hon David Parker Rt Hon Winston Peters Hon Dr Nick Smith CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 4 Appendix B Agreement between Canada and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Executive summary The Agreement between Canada and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively known as “the new DTA”) has been negotiated to replace an existing agreement with Canada (the existing DTA) that dates back to 1980. Canada is a significant trading partner for New Zealand and an important source of investment. As of March 2011, Canada was our 10th largest investment partner and the total stock of investment between the two countries was worth $3.15 billion. Canada is also our 19th largest bilateral trade partner. In the year to June 2011, total bilateral trade between New Zealand and Canada was worth $1.07 billion. The new DTA updates the existing DTA to reflect international developments and changes in each country’s treaty policy since 1980. The new DTA represents an improvement on the existing DTA and because of this should be welcomed by taxpayers. The DTA is expected to enhance New Zealand’s cross-border trade and investment by  providing greater certainty in respect of the taxation of cross-border income  reducing compliance costs  lowering withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties (with rates in line with New Zealand’s broader tax treaty strategy). The new DTA is intended to ensure the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Canada are up-to-date and provide the levels of certainty and protection that taxpayers expect from a modern treaty. The allocation of taxing rights under the new DTA for the most part remains unchanged from the existing DTA. The most significant change to the agreement is the reduction of withholding tax rates on dividend, interest, and royalties which, as explained above, have been reduced in line with New Zealand’s new, wider strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the reduction in withholding rates is expected to be relatively small, at approximately $0.5 million per year. On balance, officials are satisfied that the potential advantages to New Zealand from the new DTA with Canada entering into force will outweigh any potential disadvantages. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 5 It is proposed that the new DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The new DTA will then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes. The new DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of the two notes. Nature and timing of the proposed treaty action The Agreement between Canada and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and its accompanying Protocol (collectively known as “the new DTA”) was signed in Wellington on 3 May 2012. It was signed in English and French, with both texts having equal authority. The English text of the new DTA is attached at Annex 1. Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, in accordance with Standing Orders 394 to 397, the new DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. In accordance with Article 28 of the new DTA, the new DTA will then be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes confirming the completion of all necessary domestic procedures for entry into force in each country. The new DTA will enter into force on the date of the later of these notes. It is expected that the new DTA will enter into force by the end of 2012. As each provision of the new DTA comes into effect in accordance with Article 28, the equivalent provision of the existing DTA will cease to have effect. The existing DTA will terminate once all of its provisions cease to have effect. Like other DTAs, the new DTA will not apply to the Cook Islands, Niue, or Tokelau. Reasons for New Zealand becoming party to the treaty Canada is one of New Zealand’s key trading and investment partners. As of March 2011, Canada was our 10th largest investment partner, and the total stock of investment between the two countries was worth $3.15 billion. Canada is also our 19th largest bilateral trade partner. In the year to June 2011, total bilateral trade between New Zealand and Canada was worth $1.07 billion. Exports to Canada in this period were worth $540 million. (New Zealand export figures to Canada may be higher as exports to Canada via the United States are not reflected in official statistics.) In the same period, New Zealand’s imports from Canada were worth NZ$529.7 million. (Further information about investment and trade flows between New Zealand and Canada is attached as Annex 2.) Given Canada’s position as one of New Zealand’s key trading partners, it is important for the treaty to be kept up-to-date and reflect each country’s current treaty policies. The existing DTA was concluded in 1980 and is one of New Zealand’s older tax treaties. As such, the existing treaty does not reflect international developments or developments in New Zealand’s treaty policies and practices. In particular, the withholding tax rates specified in the existing DTA are substantially higher than those in our more recent DTAs. The new DTA represents an improvement from the existing treaty and will provide the levels of certainty and protection that taxpayers expect from a modern treaty. Amongst CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 6 other things, the new DTA includes lower withholding tax rates, similar to those agreed to in the recent Protocol with the United States and the new Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement (DTA). The new DTA reflects New Zealand’s more recent treaty policies. What double tax agreements do Double tax agreements (DTAs) foster growth in economic activity between countries by reducing tax impediments to cross-border services, trade, and investment. Essentially, DTAs provide bilateral solutions to problems that are difficult to solve unilaterally. They provide greater certainty of tax treatment, provide a basis for sharing the cost of relieving double taxation, provide a bilateral basis for limiting withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, reduce compliance costs for business, and exempt certain short-term activities from tax in the jurisdiction in which the activities are conducted. New Zealand concluded its first DTA in 1947 with the United Kingdom. Since then, New Zealand has progressively developed a network of DTAs, predominantly with its main trading and investment partners, and has 37 DTAs now in force. New Zealand enters into DTAs in large part on the basis of self-interest. That is, because DTAs create favourable conditions for increased economic activity between countries, they are expected to be beneficial to New Zealand in economic and fiscal terms at a national level. More generally, however, DTA networks also make an important contribution to the expansion of world trade and to the development of the world economy. These are also key objectives of the OECD. The OECD has assumed a leading role, internationally, in promoting the use of DTAs. In particular, the OECD has produced a Model Tax Convention, together with a comprehensive commentary, for member and non-member countries to use as a basis for concluding DTAs. The OECD Council has also issued an express recommendation to all member countries:  “to pursue their efforts to conclude bilateral tax conventions ... with those member countries, and where appropriate with non-member countries, with which they have not yet entered into such conventions...  when concluding new bilateral conventions or revising existing bilateral conventions, to conform to the Model Tax Convention, as interpreted by the Commentaries thereon.” 1 DTAs provide the following general benefits: 1 The recommendation was issued by the OECD Council on 23 October 1997, but follows similar recommendations that have been in place since before New Zealand joined the OECD. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 7  Benefits to taxpayers. A key concern for any taxpayer wanting to enter into commercial activity in another jurisdiction is the requirement to comply with the tax and other legal obligations of two separate jurisdictions. This can be perplexing, and obtaining professional advice or tax rulings can be costly and time-consuming. Unique issues also arise from cross-border activities. These issues range from the complex, such as transfer pricing disputes, to the more mundane, such as whether taxes paid in the other jurisdiction are creditable against home jurisdiction tax. DTAs help alleviate many of these problems. For example, they establish a framework for the taxation of cross-border activity, prohibit the application of discriminatory taxes, and establish a mutual agreement procedure for resolving tax disputes. The mutual agreement procedure is a key benefit for taxpayers. It is not a full disputes resolution mechanism as it only obliges the two tax authorities to endeavour to resolve issues. However, it enables tax authorities to have a dialogue about a taxpayer’s issues. It also provides a low compliance-cost alternative to seeking redress through the Courts for taxpayers concerned that they have not been taxed correctly in either or both jurisdictions (including in transfer pricing cases).  Benefits to investors. Investing across an international border often involves risk. Among other things, tax laws tend to be very complex and can change suddenly. DTAs assist investors by specifying the maximum rates of withholding taxes that can be applied to dividends, interest, and royalties. These “headline” rates reduce compliance costs for investors by making it easier to determine the after-tax returns on potential investments. The fact that the rates are “locked in” by treaty means that investors can make business decisions with more confidence.  Benefits to governments. Low tax rates can lead to increased foreign investment and a reduction in the cost of importing capital. Countries may lower their tax rates unilaterally. However, a benefit of lowering tax rates in a bilateral treaty setting is that it ensures that the rates are also lowered on a reciprocal basis by the treaty partner. This secures benefits for domestic investors. In addition, the reduced foreign tax can flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduced need to provide foreign tax credits.  Relief of double taxation. Double taxation distorts business decisions and generally hinders cross-border economic activity. In recognition of this, most jurisdictions unilaterally relieve double taxation of their tax residents. This is typically achieved by means of a tax credit mechanism, but some jurisdictions prefer an exemption method. However, in the absence of a DTA, a jurisdiction bears the full cost of relieving double taxation itself. DTAs allow the cost of relieving double taxation to be shared. They do this by allocating taxing rights between the jurisdictions concerned, on the basis of internationally accepted principles as set out in the OECD Model Tax Convention. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 8  Bilateral co-operation for administration of tax laws. It is an internationally accepted principle that countries do not assist each other in the enforcement of tax laws. 2 However, most countries tax their residents on income earned worldwide. International co-operation between tax authorities is also needed to enable tax authorities to verify that offshore income is being correctly reported by their tax residents. DTAs resolve this problem by establishing bilateral treaty arrangements for the exchange of tax-related information such as tax records, business books and accounts, bank information and ownership information. The information that is exchanged assists tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. More generally, the mere existence of DTAs can deter evasion and avoidance. This is one of the key benefits of DTAs for governments. The recent global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of bilateral co-operation in the form of exchange of information, and there is now a very strong international imperative (driven by the G-20 and the OECD) for all governments to enter into comprehensive exchange of tax information networks with relevant partners. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand As a bilateral instrument, the new DTA involves a trade-off between advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand. On balance the new DTA is expected to be beneficial to New Zealand. Advantages to New Zealand of the new DTA entering into force DTAs are generally designed to foster increased trade and investment. Canada is a key trading and investment partner. It is important to New Zealand’s interests that a DTA between Canada and New Zealand remains up-to-date and relevant to the prevailing business environment. The new DTA will update existing arrangements to ensure the DTA provides modern levels of certainty and protection with respect to cross-border income earning activities between the two countries. The allocation of taxing rights under the new DTA largely remains unchanged from existing arrangements. However, withholding tax rates imposed by both New Zealand and Canada on dividend, interest, and royalties have been reduced in line with New Zealand’s new, wider strategy on treaty withholding tax rates.  Dividends: the dividend withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the dividend is paid to a company that directly owns at least 10 percent of the voting power of the company paying the dividend.  Interest: the interest withholding tax rate will be reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent generally and a rate of 0 percent for financial institutions provided the approved issuer levy is paid by the New Zealand borrower. 2 In New Zealand, this principle is stated in Connor v Connor \[1974\] 1 NZLR 632. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 9  Royalties: in the case of royalties, the withholding tax rate has been reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent generally. However, a further reduced rate of 5 percent applies for copyright royalties and royalties for computer software and other patent or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. The new DTA has anti-abuse provisions that are aimed at preventing persons who are not entitled to the low treaty withholding tax rates from gaining access to those low rates. Disadvantages to New Zealand of the new DTA entering into force New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the reduction on withholding taxes from the existing DTA. However, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue when taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and Canadian tax is correspondingly reduced or eliminated under the new DTA. The revenue cost to New Zealand arising from the reduction in withholding taxes is estimated to be $0.5 million per year. The new DTA provides for the assistance in collection of taxes imposed by the other country. Inland Revenue will incur some costs if a request for assistance in collection is made by the Canadian Revenue. However, New Zealand has entered into such arrangements in a number of its treaties and has a well-established system to deal with any requests. It is expected that any cost incurred will be marginal. Furthermore, the arrangement is reciprocal which means New Zealand will be able to make a request to the Canadian Revenue for assistance to collect taxes on behalf of New Zealand in Canada. There are some general disadvantages to concluding a DTA (for example the “locked- in” nature of a treaty or the costs incurred in administering the exchange of information provisions), these disadvantages are not as relevant for a renegotiation of an existing DTA as many of these disadvantages have already been absorbed by New Zealand. Therefore, apart from the reduction in revenue and marginal increase in administration costs as discussed previously, there are no new disadvantages created as a result of the new DTA. It would be an option for New Zealand not to enter into the new DTA with Canada. This would mean the existing DTA will continue to apply but would not reflect developments in New Zealand’s treaty policies and practices. In particular, the high withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and royalties would continue to apply. Conclusion On balance, it is considered to be in New Zealand’s interests to conclude the new DTA with Canada. It is expected that a more modernised DTA will enhance cross-border trade and investment by providing greater certainty in the taxation of cross-border trade. It will also bring the DTA with Canada in line with New Zealand’s current strategy on withholding taxes. Obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms The new DTA will not impose any requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it will impose are on the respective Governments, restricting their taxing rights under domestic CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 10 law on a reciprocal basis and requiring the provision of assistance in the exchange of information in relation to tax matters and the collection of taxes. The new DTA will not require the imposition of any tax that is not already imposed under domestic law. Where income is derived from one country (the country of source) by a tax resident of the other country (the country of residence) the country of residence generally retains taxing rights under the new DTA. The main impact of the DTA is to restrict the ability of the country of source to tax the income in certain circumstances. Where both countries are permitted to tax the income, the DTA requires the country of residence to provide a credit for the tax imposed by the country of source. The broad framework for allocating taxing rights under the new DTA is essentially unchanged from the existing DTA. The key provisions of the DTA are as follows: Business profits (Articles 5 and 7) Similar to the existing DTA, the new DTA will ensure that business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment in the jurisdiction of source. In that case, the profits may be taxed in the source jurisdiction. A permanent establishment generally exists in the jurisdiction in question when there is a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. However, article 5 includes a number of clarifying and deeming rules that refine the permanent establishment concept. The clarifying and deeming rules are updated in the new DTA to match New Zealand’s current standard treaty policy. Income from services (Article 5) A key change from the existing DTA is that the new DTA includes an optional OECD provision (adopted by the OECD in 2008) that deals more comprehensively with the taxation of income from services. An enterprise will be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it performs services in the other jurisdiction and either of the following criteria are met:  the services are performed through an individual who is present in the other jurisdiction for at least 183 days in any 12-month period and more than 50 percent of the gross revenues attributable to the active business activities of the enterprise during this time are derived from the services performed in that jurisdiction through the individual; or  the services are performed in that other jurisdiction in relation to the same or connected projects, through one or more individuals, for at least 183 days in any 12- month period. It is now standard treaty practice for New Zealand to seek the inclusion of this provision in DTA negotiations. Income from immovable property (Article 6) As is the case in the existing DTA, income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the jurisdiction where the property is situated. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 11 Ship and aircraft operations (Article 8) As is the case in the existing DTA, profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic will generally be taxable only in that country. However, the new DTA includes a new rule that will ensure that any profits derived from domestic carriage can be taxed by the country of source. This new rule has been New Zealand standard treaty policy since 1995. Non-resident withholding tax (Articles 10, 11 and 12) The new DTA reduces withholding taxes, consistent with New Zealand’s broader strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The main objective of that strategy is to reduce withholding taxes on foreign non-portfolio dividends received by New Zealand residents. This will reduce tax barriers for New Zealand businesses with direct investments offshore, making it less costly to repatriate foreign profits back to New Zealand where they can be reinvested or distributed to shareholders. The withholding tax rates in the existing DTA stand at 15 percent for dividend, interest, and royalty payments between Canada and New Zealand. Article 10 of the new DTA limits the rate of withholding tax on dividends on a reciprocal basis to 5 percent if the dividend goes to a company owning at least 10 percent of the company making the distribution, and in all other cases the rate is 15 percent. The rates agreed in this treaty are consistent with New Zealand’s overall policy of seeking to reduce rates of withholding taxes for non-portfolio dividends where possible. Note that, as was the case with the existing DTA, article 10 preserves Canada’s right to impose its branch profits tax. However, the maximum rate of tax that Canada imposes has been reduced from 15 percent to 5 percent in the new DTA. Article 11 of the new DTA generally limits the rate of withholding tax on interest on a reciprocal basis to 10 percent. For financial institutions, the withholding tax rate will be reduced to 0 percent. However, in the case of a New Zealand borrower paying interest to a Canadian financial institution, the 0 percent rate will only apply where approved issuer levy has been paid in New Zealand. Article 12 of the new DTA generally limits the rate of withholding tax on royalties on a reciprocal basis to 10 percent per cent generally. However, a rate of 5 percent cent will apply for copyright royalties and royalties for computer software and other patent or information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience. Note that the definition of royalties in the new DTA is also wider than the definition in the existing DTA – namely the definition in the new DTA includes “know-how payments” (paid for the provision of information concerning industrial, commercial, or scientific experience) and “forbearance payments” (made to secure the exclusive right to use property). These definitions are now a standard feature of New Zealand’s treaty practice. Alienation of property (Article 13) As was the case with the existing DTA, gains from the alienation of property will generally be taxable in the country of source. However, gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic will remain taxable only in the country of residence. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 12 A new addition to the article is a feature that ensures double taxation does not occur in the case of “exit taxes” imposed on an individual who ceases to be a tax resident of one country and immediately becomes a tax resident of the other country. The individual can elect, in the new country of residence, to be treated as having alienated their assets at the time when their place of residence is changed. The mechanism is complex, but is intended to ensure that each country can only tax the amount of gain that represents an increase in value of the asset that occurred while the individual was tax resident in that country. The rule was proposed by Canada, and generally supports Canada’s “exit tax” rules. Income from employment (Article 14) As is the case in the existing DTA, income from employment will be taxable only in the country of which the employee is a resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country and certain other criteria are met. Directors’ fees (Article 15) As is the case in the existing DTA, directors’ fees will be taxable in the country where the company paying the fees is resident. Entertainers & sportspersons (Article 16) The allocation of taxing rights in this article generally remains the same as the existing DTA. That is, the country of source is able to tax entertainers and sportspersons for performances within its jurisdiction, even if the person is only present there for a very short period. The new DTA also includes an anti-abuse rule to prevent individuals from circumventing the article by having their fees paid to a separate enterprise. Pensions (Article 17) Although the allocation of taxing rights in this article is a departure from New Zealand’s preferred policy position of sole taxation by the country of residence, it remains the same as the existing DTA. Pensions and annuities will be taxable in both the country of source and the country of residence. However, the rate of tax on such payments is limited to 15 percent in the country of source. The article also provides a new provision which preserves any exemption from tax in the country of source on war pensions and allowances. Additionally, taxation of alimony payments in the country of residence will be limited to the amount that would have been taxable in the country of source if the recipient of that payment had been a resident of that country. Government service (Article 18) As was the case in the existing DTA, salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country will generally be exempt from tax in the other country. Students (Article 19) As was the case in the existing DTA, students of one country who are in the other country solely for the purpose of their education or training shall not be taxed in that other country on payments from outside that country received for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 13 Other income (Article 20) The allocation of taxing rights under article 20 remains unchanged from the existing DTA. The country of source retains a right to tax income that is not dealt with in the other articles of the new DTA. As with the existing DTA, Canada retains a taxing right of up to 15 percent on distributions from Canadian trusts, provided that the distribution is taxed in New Zealand. Non-discrimination (Article 22) The OECD model includes an article that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality, situs of an enterprise, ownership of capital, and (in limited circumstances) residence. Article 22 of the new DTA lays down an alternative formulation that we have used in a number of other treaties: this requires that non-residents be treated in a comparable manner to other non-residents, rather than as New Zealand residents. The existing DTA does not include a non-discrimination article. Other administrative requirements As was the case with the existing DTA, both countries will have to comply with various administrative requirements imposed by the new DTA. These include a general requirement to eliminate double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid (Article 21), complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the new DTA (Article 23), and complying with the arrangements for the exchange of information (Article 24). The new DTA also authorises the New Zealand and Canadian tax authorities to assist each other in the collection of taxes. The article is based on an optional article that was included in the OECD Model Tax Convention in 2002. The existing DTA did not contain any similar provision. New Zealand does not seek the inclusion of this article in all DTAs, but does seek its inclusion in DTAs with countries where it can be expected to give rise to real benefits. This is likely to be the case with Canada. Dispute resolution mechanisms Similar to the existing DTA, the new DTA also provides for taxpayer disputes to be resolved through “mutual agreement” by the revenue authorities in both countries. Rather than having to pursue a case through the courts – possibly, in both countries – a taxpayer can approach the local tax authority under the mutual agreement procedure set out in Article 23. If that authority considers the case to be justified, and cannot resolve it through its own actions, it shall seek to do so through mutual agreement with the tax authority of the other country. This bipartisan approach is particularly appropriate in the tax treaty context because a single issue will generally affect a person’s tax position in both countries. The mutual agreement procedure is not a true disputes resolution mechanism as it does not require both parties to reach agreement. The obligation is for both parties to “endeavour” to resolve the issue. However, the measure is popular with taxpayers as it is a low-cost option for pursuing tax disputes and it requires both parties to reconsider issues in consultation with each other. It remains open to the taxpayer to pursue the matter through the Courts if the outcome of the mutual agreement procedure is unsuccessful (or if they do not agree with the outcome). CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 14 The mutual agreement procedure also generally requires the tax authorities of the two countries to endeavour to resolve together any difficulties or doubts about the correct interpretation or application of the new DTA, and allows them to consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the new DTA. Reservations The treaty does not allow parties to make a reservation upon ratification. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the new DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs by Order in Council. The overriding effect is limited to the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts enables the provisions of the new DTA to provide relief from tax that would otherwise be imposed under domestic law. The override of the Official Information Act is necessary to ensure that confidential communications with the other Contracting State are not required to be disclosed. The override of the Privacy Act is necessary to ensure that information regarding natural persons can be exchanged according to the terms of the treaty. Article 28 provides for the new DTA to be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes between the Contracting States. The new DTA will enter into force on the date of the last of these notes. New Zealand will be in a position to notify Canada that all procedures required by domestic law have been completed once the Order in Council has entered into force, 28 days after its publication in the Gazette. The provisions of the new DTA will then have effect from various dates, according to the terms of the new DTA. In New Zealand, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will have effect on or after the first day of the second month following entry into force, and for other taxes for income years beginning on or after 1 April following entry into force. In the case of Canada, the provisions relating to withholding taxes will have effect on or after the first day of the second month following entry into force, and for other taxes the new DTA will have effect for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following entry into force. The only alternative to an Order in Council for implementing a DTA would be by the enactment of a dedicated statute. This is not preferred as it would unnecessarily increase the amount of primary tax legislation. Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action No social, cultural, or environmental effects are anticipated. As noted in this NIA, the overall economic effects of the new DTA between New Zealand and Canada are expected to be favourable. The new DTA will enhance the existing CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 15 investment and trade relationship by ensuring the arrangements governing double taxation between New Zealand and Canada are up-to-date and provide the levels of certainty and protection that taxpayers expect from a modern treaty. Compliance costs for New Zealand businesses are expected to be reduced as a result of the treaty action. This is because New Zealand businesses will have clearer and more up- to- date guidance about when they will be liable for tax on activities in Canada, in line with internationally recognised norms. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty The principle cost to New Zealand with the new DTA will be the reduction in withholding tax rates on dividends, interest, and royalties. Officials expect that any additional revenue cost (outside the reduction in the withholding tax rates) will be minimal because the new DTA is a replacement of an existing DTA, and the allocation of taxing rights generally remains the same between the new DTA and the existing DTA. Data limitations prevent officials from precisely estimating revenue costs, including, the likely revenue cost of the reduction in withholding tax rates. However, officials estimate the prima facie reduction of tax revenue as a result of the reduced withholding tax rates with Canada to be $0.5 million per annum. As discussed, the new DTA will be expected to give rise to favourable economic benefits, such as increased trade and investment. Any costs may also be offset by other impacts of the DTA. For example, there will be some offsetting effect to the New Zealand tax base from the reduction of tax in Canada, and the reduced need for New Zealand to allow foreign tax credits. Overall, it is expected that the economic benefits will outweigh the costs. It has been noted above that the assistance in collection of taxes provisions of the new DTA will result in some administrative costs for Inland Revenue because of the need to collect Canadian taxes. While these costs cannot be quantified precisely, they are expected to be small. Additionally, the arrangement is reciprocal in nature and any costs incurred will likely be offset by the benefits accruing to New Zealand from the ability to ask Canada to collect taxes on our behalf. Consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury have been consulted about the terms of the new DTA and the content of this extended NIA and no material concerns were raised. No private sector consultation has been entered into. Subsequent protocols or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects No further amendments are anticipated at this time. New Zealand will consider future amendments on a case-by-case basis. Any amendments to the new DTA will be subject to the normal domestic approvals and procedures. While there is no amendment clause in the new DTA, amendment would be subject to the usual requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 16 An accompanying Protocol forms an integral part of the new DTA and will be signed at the same time. Countries often prefer clarifying provisions and departures from their standard treaty model to be located in an accompanying Protocol. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty Under Article 29, either country may terminate the new DTA by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar. In such event, the new DTA will cease to have effect for New Zealand for payments made on, or after, the first day of the second month following the notice of termination (in respect of withholding tax), and for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination is given (in respect of other New Zealand tax). The new DTA will cease to have effect for Canada for payments made on, or after, the first day of the second month following the notice of termination (in respect of withholding tax), and for taxation years beginning after the end of the calendar year following the year in which the notice of termination is given (in respect of other Canadian tax). Agency Disclosure Statement Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis (NIA). It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing the new DTA between Canada and New Zealand and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. As part of that process, it has considered the option of not entering into the treaty. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. The policy aligns with the Government Statement on Regulation. The allocation of taxing rights under the new DTA for the most part remains unchanged from the existing DTA. It is broadly consistent with the New Zealand negotiating model, which in turn is based on the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. However, withholding tax rates on dividend, interest and royalties have been reduced in line with New Zealand’s new, wider strategy on treaty withholding tax rates. The revenue cost to New Zealand as a result of the reduction in withholding rates is expected to be relatively small, at approximately $0.5 million per year. An Order in Council will be required to give the new DTA effect in New Zealand law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the new DTA. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury have been consulted about the terms of the new DTA and the content of this extended NIA and no material concerns were raised. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on business; nor impair private property rights, market competition, or the incentives for business to innovate and invest; nor override fundamental common law principles. CONVENTION BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND CANADA FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION 17 ANNEX 2: New Zealand-Canada cross-border investment and trade Investment As at 31 March 2011, the total stock of investment between New Zealand and Canada was worth $3.15 billion. Canada is New Zealand’s 10th largest investment partner. New Zealand’s total stock of investment in Canada was worth NZ$1.29 billion as at 31 March 2011. This represents 0.8percent of New Zealand’s total investment abroad and is comparable to New Zealand’s total investment in Hong Kong (NZ$1.2 billion). Of this, NZ$60 million was direct investment and NZ$687 million was portfolio. The total stock of investment from Canada into New Zealand was worth NZ$1.86 billion as at 31 March 2011. A similar amount has been invested by the People’s Republic of China (NZ$1.83 billion). Of this investment by Canada, NZ$1.02 billion was direct, which constitutes 1.1percent of foreign direct investment into New Zealand. NZ$356 million was portfolio investment. Trade In the year to June 2011, total bilateral trade between New Zealand and Canada was worth $1.07 billion. This constitutes 1.2 percent of New Zealand’s total trade, and is comparable to New Zealand’s trade with France (1.2 percent) and Hong Kong (1.0 percent). Canada is currently our 19th largest bilateral trading partner. Exports to Canada in this period were worth NZ$540 million. This is a 12.8 percent increase over the previous year, although it is a decrease of 7.2 percent since 2001. In the year to June 2011, New Zealand’s main exports to Canada were beef meat (NZ$119.5 million) sheep meat (NZ$112.4 million) and wine (NZ$59.2 million). Canada is New Zealand’s seventh largest export market for meat products and fourth largest market for wine. In the same period, New Zealand’s imports from Canada were worth NZ$529.7 million. This is a 16.6 percent increase over the previous year, and an increase of 18 percent since 2001. New Zealand’s principal imports from Canada consisted of fertilisers (NZ$74 million), pig meat (NZ$35.5 million), and turbine engines (NZ$32.3 million).
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Contents Recommendation 2  Appendix A 4  Appendix B 5  AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 2 Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes Recommendation The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, and recommends that the House take note of its report. On 29 August 2012, New Zealand signed the agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes. Under this agreement, New Zealand and Niue can request information from each other with the aim of detecting and preventing tax avoidance and evasion. Such agreements are used to establish a mechanism for facilitating the exchange of information when a comprehensive tax treaty may not be appropriate. Niue has historically been recognised as a tax haven by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), and in spite of its having repealed all the legislation which led to this designation with effect from 2006, Niue still appears on some countries’ tax haven blacklists. Niue is seeking to conclude exchange of information agreements with other countries to demonstrate that it is not in fact a tax haven any longer, and in the hope that it will be removed from blacklists. As New Zealand is Niue’s largest economic partner, its first approach was to New Zealand. We asked the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) what benefits the agreement would confer, for both parties. We heard that it is largely beneficial to Niue, in its efforts to improve its international standing. The agreement will have minimal benefits for New Zealand, as we will be unlikely to need to request much tax information from Niue. There is an inherent danger in such an agreement in that any personal and financial information exchanged passes out of New Zealand’s hands. Strict provisions governing the disclosure and use of the information are enshrined in the treaty. The IRD also told us that both jurisdictions have laws to protect the information, which meet the international standards imposed and monitored by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (the global forum), a multilateral framework for global transparency and exchange of information in tax matters among OECD and non-OECD economies. Should information be mishandled, New Zealand can report it to the Global Forum. New Zealand could also withdraw from the treaty. We asked the IRD if we were entering into an agreement that could be difficult to administer in practice because of Niue’s lack of robust administration and history of on- going border problems. They replied that some dangers remained, but pointed out that as a member of the global forum New Zealand has an obligation to enter into information exchange agreements with any other forum members that request them. We heard that the AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 3 global forum is perceived internationally as a success, and that it is in New Zealand’s overall interests to commit itself to the treaty. The national interest analysis for the treaty is appended to this report.

On 29 August 2012, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (the Niue TIEA). 2. The Niue TIEA establishes a mechanism by which tax officials from New Zealand and Niue (the Contracting Parties) can request tax-related information from each other (such as business books and accounts, bank information, and information on the ownership of legal entities), for the purpose of detecting and preventing tax evasion and avoidance. 3. A tax information exchange agreement (a TIEA) is a form of tax treaty designed to establish exchange of information arrangements with jurisdictions, such as tax havens, with which it may not be appropriate to enter into a more comprehensive form of tax treaty. To date, New Zealand has entered into 18 TIEAs with tax havens, and additional TIEAs are under negotiation. 4. Niue was identified as a tax haven in a list published in 2000 in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Niue has now repealed the key legislation that led to it being identified as a tax haven, but has found that in practice it is difficult to lose the tax haven “tag”. Many countries still consider the 2000 OECD list of tax havens to be definitive. For example, Niue has been added to an OECD country’s tax haven blacklist as recently as 2010 (even though the last of Niue’s tax haven legislation was repealed in 2006). 5. Niue is currently taking steps to address the tax haven perception. Among other things, Niue has requested TIEAs from a number of countries, to demonstrate its commitment to transparency and exchange of information. In view of the close historical, constitutional and economic ties between our two countries, New Zealand was one of the first countries that Niue approached. 6. TIEAs are specifically designed to assist tax authorities detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. Any reduction of tax evasion or avoidance will give rise to revenue gains for New Zealand. However, Niue is no longer a tax haven, and the risk of New Zealand residents evading or avoiding New Zealand tax through the use of legal structures and transactions involving Niue is very low. Therefore, the actual benefit to New Zealand in revenue terms from entering into the Niue TIEA is likely to be minimal. Nature and timing of proposed binding treaty action 7. On 29 August 2012, New Zealand signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Niue on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes (the Niue TIEA). The proposed treaty action is to bring the Niue TIEA into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes confirming that Niue and New Zealand have AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 6 completed their respective constitutional and legal requirements for entry into force, pursuant to Article 12 of the TIEA. 8. Before the exchange of diplomatic notes (and subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process), the Niue TIEA will need to be incorporated into domestic legislation by an Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The making of the Order in Council is expected to be completed early in 2013. 9. On entry into force, the Niue TIEA will apply prospectively as follows:  for criminal tax matters, the Niue TIEA provisions will apply from the date of entry into force; and  for all other matters, the Niue TIEA provisions will apply to taxable periods beginning on or after 1 January following the date of entry into force or, where there is no taxable period, to all charges to tax arising on or after 1 January following the date of entry into force. Reasons for New Zealand to become a Party to the treaty 10. New Zealand has been entering into bilateral exchange of information arrangements in double tax agreements (DTAs) since 1947, and into TIEAs since 2007. A DTA is a comprehensive form of tax treaty that is generally preferred for use with major trading and investment partners. A TIEA is a more appropriate form of treaty for jurisdictions, including tax havens. To date, New Zealand has concluded 55 DTAs and TIEAs (made up of 37 DTAs and 18 TIEAs). To be effective, a country’s network of exchange of information treaties needs to be as wide as possible. The negotiation of additional DTAs and TIEAs is therefore an on-going facet of New Zealand’s tax policy work programme. 11. Exchange of information is a critical tool for tax authorities worldwide in the detection and prevention of tax evasion and tax avoidance. For example, when investigating the tax affairs of a particular taxpayer, Inland Revenue acting on its own can have difficulty verifying whether the taxpayer has reported their income-earning and financial activities correctly for tax purposes, when these activities are conducted outside New Zealand’s territorial borders. Exchange of information provisions in tax treaties with other jurisdictions will enable Inland Revenue to request a treaty partner tax authority to use its information-gathering powers to obtain the necessary information and forward that information to us. 12. However, although concluding a TIEA with Niue is consistent with New Zealand’s efforts to keep widening its network of exchange of information treaties, the Niue TIEA was entered into predominantly for other reasons. 13. Niue was identified as a tax haven in a list published in an OECD report in 2000. 1 At that time, Niue operated an “offshore financial centre” that included preferential banking, insurance, company, partnership and trust regimes (available only to non-residents, and ring-fenced from Niue’s domestic economy). Niue subsequently abolished its offshore financial centre and repealed all of the related legislation, and from the end of 2006 should no longer have been considered to be a tax haven. However, many countries still consider 1 The list of tax havens was included in the OECD’s report: “Towards Global Tax Co-operation: Progress in Identifying and Eliminating Harmful Tax Practices”. AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 7 the 2000 OECD list of tax havens to be definitive. Other countries appear to be concerned that Niue could re-establish its offshore financial centre at any time. This has made it difficult for Niue to escape its tax haven “tag”. For example, as recently as 2010, an OECD country added Niue to its country blacklist of tax havens. 14. Niue is currently taking steps to show that it does not pose any risk to the international community. In particular, Niue has joined the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information (the Global Forum), and has submitted itself for peer review by that organisation. The first phase of that review is currently in progress. However, peer reviews conducted by the Global Forum focus on the effectiveness of a jurisdiction’s exchange of information treaties, and Niue does not yet have any exchange of information treaties in place. The Global Forum’s initial report on Niue is therefore likely to be very negative. (Global Forum reports are published, and the Global Forum also reports annually to the G20 on the outcome of its peer reviews. The G20 has threatened to deploy sanctions against non-complying jurisdictions.) 15. These developments mean that Niue urgently needs to conclude TIEAs or other exchange of information treaties. As Niue’s most significant economic partner, and due to our historic and constitutional ties, New Zealand was one of the first countries that Niue approached to seek a TIEA. Niue is currently also enacting implementation legislation that will enable it to enter into and give effect to TIEAs. 16. Because Niue is no longer a tax haven, New Zealand is unlikely to need to make many requests for information to Niue under the Niue TIEA. However, the close constitutional ties between New Zealand and Niue mean that the continuing perception of Niue as a tax haven raises reputational issues for New Zealand. Assisting Niue to improve its international standing, by entering into TIEAs and thereby demonstrating a commitment to exchange of information, is in New Zealand’s overall interests. 17. Alternative options, other than entering into a TIEA, have been explored. However, no feasible non-regulatory options have been identified. It is not a realistic option for New Zealand to decline to enter into the TIEA. This is because there is now an international expectation that countries will enter into exchange of information treaties when asked by another country. This expectation has been codified into the Terms of Reference used by the Global Forum in its country peer reviews. 2 New Zealand is also subject to Global Forum peer review, and therefore is subject to this requirement. 18. A possible alternative treaty option would be for both New Zealand and Niue to sign an existing OECD multilateral treaty (the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters) that provides for exchange of information in tax matters, amongst other things. The New Zealand Government is currently considering the option of signing the OECD multilateral treaty. New Zealand officials have also proposed to Niuean officials that they recommend to their Government that Niue signs the multilateral treaty. 19. For the reasons given above, Niue effectively needs to conclude exchange of information treaties as quickly as possible. The multilateral treaty would generally assist Niue in this regard. Signing, however, would give rise to other implications for Niue such as an on-going requirement to pay a fee of around 5,000 euros per annum and potentially provide for some additional forms of assistance in tax matters. Due to such 2 Footnote 27 of the Global Forum’s Terms of Reference. AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 8 issues, very few small island jurisdictions, like Niue, have signed the multilateral treaty to date. Accordingly, it is by no means certain that Niue will sign the multilateral treaty. In the short-term, for the purposes of the Global Forum peer review currently in progress, Niue needs to urgently conclude TIEAs to demonstrate its commitment to exchange of information. 20. Note that, if New Zealand and Niue were to both sign the OECD multilateral treaty, after having already signed a TIEA, the fact that there would then be two exchange of information treaty arrangements in place would not create problems. The same issue would also arise in respect of other New Zealand DTAs and TIEAs. In practice, information could be exchanged under either treaty instrument. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force and not entering into force for New Zealand 21. TIEAs are specifically designed to assist tax authorities to detect and prevent tax evasion and tax avoidance. Any reduction of tax evasion or avoidance will give rise to revenue gains for New Zealand. However, Niue is no longer a tax haven, and the risk of New Zealand residents evading or avoiding New Zealand tax through the use of legal structures and transactions involving Niue is very low. Therefore, the actual benefit to New Zealand in revenue terms from entering into the Niue TIEA is likely to be minimal at best. 22. Although the Niue TIEA will not bring the revenue benefits that are generally anticipated from TIEAs, there will be other benefits for New Zealand. The advantages can be summarised as follows:  As described above, the close constitutional ties between New Zealand and Niue mean that there will be general reputational benefits for New Zealand if Niue can improve its international standing.  Assisting Niue to start building its own TIEA network can be expected to generally improve the effectiveness of Niue’s tax system. Tax system improvements in Niue will reduce pressure on the New Zealand Government to provide budgetary assistance to Niue. These improvements will also be consistent with other recent New Zealand Government initiatives to help Niue improve the effectiveness of its tax system and build capacity in its tax administration.  Pacific Island jurisdictions, by virtue of their relatively close proximity to New Zealand, are often perceived by other OECD member countries to be in New Zealand’s “sphere of influence”. The TIEA with Niue will extend New Zealand’s growing network of DTAs and TIEAs in the Pacific region, and demonstrate our commitment to establishing exchange of information arrangements with our closest neighbours. This will send a good signal internationally.  The Niue TIEA represents progress by New Zealand in widening its network of exchange of information treaty arrangements. 23. The only identifiable disadvantage for New Zealand in concluding a TIEA with Niue is that Inland Revenue will incur administrative costs in responding to any requests for information from Niue, which will not be subject to the usual offset by revenue gains to New Zealand from reduced tax evasion and tax avoidance by New Zealand residents. However, given Niue’s circumstances, such requests are likely to be minimal, and it is unlikely that requests would involve more complex areas such as transfer pricing. If requests are received, Inland Revenue has streamlined systems already in place for AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 9 responding to requests under its 55 other exchange of information arrangements, and additional costs will be marginal. Legal obligations which would be imposed on New Zealand by the treaty action, the position in respect of reservations to the treaty, and an outline of any dispute settlement mechanisms 24. The Niue TIEA will impose a reciprocal obligation on each Contracting Party to provide, upon request, information that is foreseeably relevant to the administration and enforcement of taxes. As noted above, Niue is unlikely to make many requests for information from New Zealand, and those it may make are unlikely to relate to complex issues such as transfer pricing. If valid requests are received, under the Niue TIEA Inland Revenue will be obliged to use its information-gathering powers to obtain the requested information, on a timely basis, and to forward that information to Niue. 25. The Contracting Parties will be required to maintain strict confidentiality regarding any information received regarding a request. Such information may be disclosed only to authorised persons, and may be used only for specified purposes (principally, the administration and enforcement of the domestic tax laws of the respective Contracting Party, see Article 8). 26. Reservations are not provided for under the Niue TIEA. 27. Article 11 of the Niue TIEA provides that any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the TIEA are to be resolved, if possible, by mutual agreement between the competent authorities (for New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his or her authorised representative; for Niue, the Secretary of Finance or the Secretary’s authorised representative). The Parties may also decide on other forms of dispute resolution. Measures which the Government could or should adopt to implement the treaty action, including specific reference to implementing legislation 28. Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Niue TIEA will be implemented into New Zealand domestic law by Order in Council, in accordance with section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section BH 1 authorises the giving of overriding effect to DTAs and TIEAs 3 by Order in Council. That is, the Order in Council may specify that the provisions of the agreement will have effect notwithstanding any provision of the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 or the Privacy Act 1993 – although only in relation to tax matters. 29. When the Niue TIEA is signed, officials will arrange for an Order in Council to be made, and for the other steps for entry into force to be undertaken. This includes New Zealand notifying Niue by diplomatic note that all of its domestic constitutional and legal procedures for entry into force of the Niue TIEA are complete. Niue will likewise notify New Zealand when its own procedures are complete. It is expected that this process will be completed before the end of 2012. 30. There are no other viable regulatory options for implementing the obligations in the agreement. 3 Despite the reference to DTAs, the agreements to which the section relates are those that have been negotiated for any one or more of the purposes listed in the section. The facilitation of exchange of information is a listed purpose. Therefore, the TIEA falls within the ambit of section BH 1. AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 10 Economic, social, cultural and environmental costs and effects of the treaty action 31. No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. The costs to New Zealand of compliance with the treaty 32. If requests for information are received from Niue under the Niue TIEA, New Zealand will incur administrative costs in complying with those information requests. As noted above, such requests are likely to be minimal and limited to non-complex matters. In addition, streamlined and effective mechanisms for dealing with exchange of information requests have already been established for New Zealand’s existing DTA and TIEA network. The administrative costs of responding to requests from Niue are therefore expected to be marginal. 33. All costs arising to Inland Revenue as a result of the operation of the Niue TIEA will be met within existing baselines. Completed or proposed consultation with the community and parties interested in the treaty action 34. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, have been consulted and agree with the proposed treaty action. Further, the concept of TIEAs in general has been canvassed in the Government’s published policy work programmes. Subsequent protocols and/or amendments to the treaty and their likely effects 35. No future amendments are anticipated. New Zealand will consider any proposed amendments to the Niue TIEA on a case by case basis, and any decision to accept an amendment would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Withdrawal or denunciation provision in the treaty 36. Article 13 of the Niue TIEA provides that either Contracting Party may terminate the Niue TIEA by giving six months’ written notice through the diplomatic channel. The Niue TIEA may only be terminated by either of the Contracting Parties three years after it has entered into force. The Contracting Parties will remain bound by the confidentiality provisions contained in Article 8 of the Niue TIEA even after it has been terminated. 37. Any decision by New Zealand to terminate the Niue TIEA would be subject to the usual domestic approvals and procedures. Agency Disclosure Statement 38. Inland Revenue has prepared this extended national interest analysis. It has undertaken an analysis of the issue of implementing a TIEA between New Zealand and Niue, and the legislative and regulatory proposals arising from that implementation. It has considered all other relevant options in that process. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis. 39. An Order in Council is required to implement the Niue TIEA into New Zealand domestic law. The Order in Council will override the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Privacy Act 1993; this is authorised by section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Niue TIEA. AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND NIUE ON THE EXCHANGE OF TAX INFORMATION 11 40. Inland Revenue notes that the form of this TIEA and national interest analysis is consistent with that of a number of previous TIEAs and national interest analyses prepared regarding other TIEAs concluded by New Zealand. 41. The advantages of the Niue TIEA to New Zealand, as noted, will likely be minimal. However, the Niue TIEA will assist Niue enhance both its international standing and the effectiveness of its tax system, which is generally in New Zealand’s interests (given our close historic and constitutional ties, and New Zealand’s provision of economic support to Niue). No costs are expected to arise from the Niue TIEA, and no risks have been identified. 42. Inland Revenue is of the view that the policy options considered will not impose additional costs on businesses; impair private property rights or market competition; adversely impact the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest; or override fundamental common principles.
