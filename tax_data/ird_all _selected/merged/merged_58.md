The proposed rules would require offshore suppliers to register and return GST when they supply services and intangibles to New Zealand-resident consumers. 1.2 The proposed rules are broadly aligned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) draft guidelines on the GST treatment of cross-border services and intangibles as well as international practice. 1.3 This paper also contains some discussion on the collection of GST on low- value imported goods but does not, at this time, propose extending any registration system to offshore suppliers of low-value goods. It does, however, acknowledge the issue around the de minimis threshold under which GST does not have to be paid on imported goods and the wider issue of the cost of collecting GST on low-value imported goods. 1.4 By seeking to address the question of GST on cross-border services and intangibles, this discussion document is the first step in a review of the collection of GST on imported goods. Submissions are therefore sought on both the services and intangibles proposals, and on the collection of GST on goods. It is anticipated that a paper on goods, specifically focusing on the GST treatment of low-value imported goods will go to Ministers by October this year. This is anticipated to be followed by public consultation and further submissions will be able to be made as part of that process. Background 1.5 GST is not usually collected on cross-border services and intangibles purchased from offshore suppliers. When GST was introduced in 1986, New Zealand consumers purchased few services from offshore, and online digital products were not yet available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported services potentially outweighed the benefits of taxation. 1.6 The growth of e-commerce means the vo lume of services and intangibles on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. This raises the question of whether the existing tax rules will remain suitable and sustainable in the future. In particular, concerns have been raised about the impact that the uneven GST treatment may have on the competitiveness of domestic providers, and on future tax revenues. 1 1.7 Non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The OECD draft guidelines focus on establishing an international set of principles for determining when countries should have the right to tax these supplies. 1.8 The draft guidelines were released for consultation on 18 December 2014 and divide services into two main groups: • “on-the-spot” services – where the supplier and the customer are likely to be in the same place when the services are supplied – for example, a person receiving a haircut; and • “r emote” services – where it is not necessary for the supplier and customer to be in the same location when the services are supplied – for example, a person downloading a song from a website. 1.9 The draft guidelines suggest that, for remotely provided services and intangibles, the consumer’s usual place of residence is the predominant test for determining which country has the right to tax. They also suggest that offshore suppliers could be required to register and return the GST on remote supplies, as is the case in the European Union. The guidelines are expected to be finalised later this year. 1.10 Apart from the European Unio n, the offshore supplier registration model has been adopted for cross-border services and intangibles by a number of countries, including Norway, South Korea, Switzerland and South Africa. Other countries, including Japan and Australia have also announced plans to introduce the model. The countries that have implemented a system report some success in collecting the GST/VAT. 1.11 Chapter 3 discusses the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. It explains why GST is not currently collected on low-value imported goods and the issues that would be involved in addressing this. Proposed new rules for taxing cross-border supplies of services and intangibles • It is proposed that services and intangibles supplied remotely by an offshore supplier to New Zealand-resident consumers will be treated as performed in New Zealand and therefore subject to GST. • Offshore suppliers will be required to register and return GST if their supplies of services to New Zealand-resident consumers exceed a given threshold in a 12-month period. Submissions are sought on the value of that threshold. • A wide definit io n o f “services” is proposed, which includes both digital services and more traditional services. • In some situations, an electronic marketplace or intermediary may be required to register instead of the principal offshore supplier. 2 • While GST is about taxing business-to-consumer supplies, submissions are sought on whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST when they supply services and intangibles remotely to New Zealand GST-registered businesses (which would normally be able to claim the GST back) and whether these services would count towards the registration thresho ld. • Offshore suppliers would be able to rely on certain objective proxies in order to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident. • If supplies to New Zealand-registered businesses are excluded, New Zealand businesses would be required to identify themselves as a business by providing their IRD number to the offshore supplier when acquiring services that would otherwise be covered by the rules. • If business-to-business supplies are excluded, the existing reverse charge rule would apply to GST-registered businesses that receive services and intangibles from offshore suppliers when the services and intangibles relate to non-taxable activities. • Again, if business-to-business supplies are excluded and a person misrepresented themselves as a business to avoid being charged GST, the existing “knowledge” offences may apply and, if applicable for more egregious cases, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would have the discretion to register the person for GST and require the GST to be paid. • The fo llowing three registration systems for offshore suppliers are being considered: – the domestic registration system; – a “pay only” registration system; or – a regional “one-stop-shop” registration system. • It is proposed that the new rules would be included in the next omnibus tax bill.

However, GST is not typically collected on cross-border services and intangibles (including internet downloads and online services) purchased fro m offshore websites. 2.2 The growth in online purchases means that the volume of imported services on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. This raises the question of whether the existing tax rules will remain suitable and sustainable in the future. Implications of non-collection 2.3 In general, the growing ability to easily purchase services online has benefited New Zealand. It has given consumers greater access to a wider range of services from around the world and increased competition in the domestic retail market. Increased competition tends to encourage the efficient use of resources, which can result in lower prices, greater innovation, and better quality goods and services for consumers. 2.4 Despite these benefits, when GST does not apply evenly, it may bias consumer and business decisions, which could lead to unfair and inefficient outcomes. Many domestic providers feel the current tax settings place them at an unfair disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price. This is having the greatest impact on sellers that provide services that are similar to services provided from offshore (or substitutable products). 2.5 There are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers purchase services online from offshore, such as overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 2.6 Furthermore, the growing e-commerce market means the amount of GST not being collected on services, intangibles and goods supplied from offshore, but consumed in New Zealand, is increasing. It is likely that around $180 million of GST is forgone on cross-border services, intangibles and goods per year (of which about $40 million relates to services and intangibles). The growth of imported goods and services is a relatively recent development and the amount is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but the growth could be around 10 percent a year. 5 2.7 Government revenues pay for important public services such as education, healthcare, roads and superannuation. Given that 18 percent of total Government revenue is collected from GST, 1 an increasing gap in that revenue base is a concern for the Government. A shortfall in GST revenue may eventually have to be paid for by tax increases or spending cuts. New Zealand’s GST system 2.8 New Zealand’s GST is a “consumption tax”. Consumption taxes seek to tax consumer spending on goods and services. The country that has the right to tax this consumer spending is generally the country in which the good or service is consumed. This is known as the “destination principle”. 2.9 Conversely, goods and services that are exported, and therefore consumed offshore, are generally untaxed (under GST, exports are zero-rated, meaning GST is charged at a rate of zero percent and businesses can claim GST back on their inputs). Allowing exporters to claim back GST on their inputs ensures that GST is not a cost on business or offshore consumers. 2.10 If countries apply the destination principle and also recognise that GST is a tax on consumers not businesses, double taxation and non-taxation in cross- border trade should largely be averted. 2.11 New Zealand’s GST system is regarded throughout the world as a model consumption tax. This is because our GST system is very broad-based – it applies to a wide range of goods and services and there are very few exemptions. When GST applies broadly it ensures that consumer decisions to purchase particular goods or services are not influenced or driven by tax considerations. This improves its efficiency and fairness, and provides simplicity. 2.12 Despite New Zealand’s broad-based GST system, GST does not generally apply to cross-border services and intangibles consumed in New Zealand. This is contrary to the destination principle and means that these services are not taxed in any country. 2.13 The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) defines “services” as anything other than goods or money, and therefore includes intangibles like digital content. GST generally only applies to services which are: • performed by New Zealand tax residents; 2 or • supplied by a non-resident, but physically performed in New Zealand. 3 2.14 When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased services from offshore, and online digital products were not yet available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing cross-border services potentially outweighed the benefits of taxation. 1 A Snapshot of the 2014 Financial Statements of the Government. http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/financialstatements/yearend/jun14snapshot/fsgnz-snap-jun14.pdf 2 Section 8(2) of the GST Act – Supply in New Zealand. 3 Section 8(3)(b) of the GST Act – Deemed supply in New Zealand by non-resident. 6 2.15 Since the introduction of GST, steps have been taken to apply GST to some cross-border services consumed in New Zealand: • Since 2003, offshore suppliers of telecommunications services have been required to return GST on telecommunications services initiated by consumers in New Zealand. 4 Note, however, that the definition of “telecommunications services” excludes the content of the telecommunication so would exclude services such as internet downloads that are delivered electronically. 5 • Since 2005, the GST reverse charge was made applicable to imported services by businesses making exempt supplies and other non-taxable supplies. A reverse charge treats the purchaser as having made the supply and therefore being liable for the GST. The reverse charge also applies to unregistered persons who acquire imported services that bring them within the $60,000 taxable supplies threshold for registration. International developments 2.16 The OECD work on GST and cross-border services and intangibles is connected with the work on “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). BEPS refers to tax planning strategies emplo yed by multinational companies that exploit gaps and mismatches in international tax rules to artificially shift profits to low or no-tax locations where there is little or no economic activity, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. 2.17 In the consumption tax context, the focus is on which country has the right to impose consumption tax on imported goods and services. In the case of goods, the place of consumption will be clear – the consumption occurs in the country of import. 2.18 There is less certainty when applying GST to cross-border services and intangibles supplied remotely. In many cases it is not clear where the consumption occurs and therefore which country has the taxing right. For example, a New Zealand resident could purchase and download a movie while overseas on holiday. Without international consensus on taxing rights, it is possible that the download could be taxed in New Zealand, the country where the download took place, neither or both. 4 See section 8(6) of the GST Act. Assuming they are registered for GST or are required to register for GST because they have more than $60,000 of supplies to New Zealand customers. 5 The definition of telecommunications services in the GST Act under section 2 states that telecommunications services means the transmission, emission or reception, and the transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for the transmission, emission or reception, of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by a similar technical system, and includes access to global information networks but does not include the content of the telecommunication. 7 2.19 The OECD has been working on a set of guidelines addressing these issues of double taxation and non-taxation that may arise from inconsistencies in the application of VAT/GST to international trade. The first stage considered VAT-neutrality and place of taxation rules for cross-border business-to-business supplies of services and intangibles. These guidelines have now been finalised and the OECD recommended that the country in which the business customer is located has the right to tax. 2.20 New Zealand adopted this approach in 2014 with the introduction of rules governing when a non-resident business can register for GST and claim input tax deductions for GST charged in New Zealand. These rules ensure GST is neutral for cross-border business-to-business supplies in the same way as for domestic businesses. 2.21 As noted in Chapter 1, the OECD is developing guidelines that establish international best practice for determining taxing rights in regard to cross- border business-to-consumer supplies of services and intangibles. The draft business-to-consumer guidelines can be found at: http://www.oecd.org/ctp/consumption/discussion-draft-oecd- international-vat-gst-guidelines.pdf 2.22 The draft business-to-consumer guidelines broadly divide cross-border services into “on-the-spot” services and “remote” services. In relation to remote services, the draft suggests the consumer’s usual place of residence as the predominant test for determining where the consumption occurs. It also suggests requiring offshore suppliers of services to register in the country of consumption as a suitable method of taxing these supplies. 2.23 The offshore supplier registration model has already been adopted for cross- border services and intangibles by the European Union, and a number of countries including Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, and will be followed by Japan and South Korea. The countries that have implemented a system report some success in collecting the GST/VAT. 2.24 Australia has also recently announced measures to apply GST to cross- border services and intangibles from 1 July 2017. Following consultation, the measures will apply to a broad range of services and intangibles received by Australian-resident consumers. 2.25 For more information on how other countries tax, or propose to tax, cross- border services and intangibles, see the attached appendix. 8 CHAPTER 3 Low-value imported goods 3.1 The non-collection of GST on low-value imported goods raises similar concerns as with cross-border services and intangibles. In particular, domestic suppliers of goods are concerned they are at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers that are able to transport low-value goods directly to their customers without the imposition of GST. 3.2 Ideally, GST should be collected on all imported goods, as these goods are likely to be consumed in New Zealand. However, New Zealand and other countries apply de minimis thresholds below which no duty, including GST, is collected on imported goods. De minimis thresholds are applied to facilitate the flow of goods and to ensure that the cost of collecting GST on low-value goods does not outweigh the benefits of doing so. 3.3 The growth of e-commerce and the practice of supplying goods directly to customers have meant that the volume of low-value goods imported by final consumers has significantly increased. Given the nature of the current methods of collecting GST on imported goods, the growing volume has meant the cost of collecting GST on these goods, and the GST revenue forgone, have both increased. 3.4 Since customs authorities, including New Zealand’s, apply similar processes for collecting GST/VAT on imported goods, the high cost of collection is an international challenge. Many countries are seeking lower cost methods of collecting GST/VAT on imported goods, however, no country has yet developed a low-cost alternative to traditional collection systems. 3.5 While low-value imported goods are not considered in the OECD draft guidelines (discussed in the previous chapter), the OECD does recognise the impact of the growth of e-commerce is having on the volume of imported low-value goods. In particular, the administrative costs of collecting GST on these goods and competitive distortions de minimis thresholds may create are recognised. 6 3.6 The Government is engaging in international discussions about lowering the cost of collecting GST on imported goods to determine whether any developments have the potential to lower the cost of collecting GST in New Zealand. 3.7 This document outlines current processes for collecting GST and tariffs on low-value imported goods, and the work that the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) has underway to look at how processes might shift over time. Readers with an interest in the collection of GST on low-value imported goods and the de minimis are invited to include concerns about this issue in their submission. This document is the first step of a wider review of the GST treatment of imported goods and it is expected that there will be 6 The OECD, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy. 9 further opportunity to make submissions in a subsequent consultation paper, specifically focusing on the GST treatment of low-value imported goods. Current imported goods rules 3.8 GST on imported goods is collected by Customs at the border. However, GST is not collected if the total duty value (including GST, tariffs and other duties) is less than $60. This is known as the “de minimis” threshold. 3.9 Depending on freight costs, the $60 de minimis threshold can roughly equate to a parcel worth $400 if GST is the only duty applying. It can equate to a parcel with a much lower value when tariff duty applies or the freight and insurance costs are high. A 10 percent tariff duty applies to a range of goods, including some apparel and footwear. 3.10 The de minimis does not apply to shipments of alcohol or tobacco products. Example Fiona purchased a new stereo for her car online from an offshore website. She paid $250 for the stereo and $50 for shipping. Since the duty on the stereo is only $45 (250 + $50 x 15 percent), which is below the de minimis, Customs will not require Fiona to pay GST. A few months later, Fiona purchased some shoes from an offshore website with a value of $250 and paid $50 for shipping. Footwear has an additional 10 percent tariff which means the total duty owing is now $73.75 (the 10 percent tariff of $25 plus the GST amount of $48.75), which is above the de minimis. Fiona is now required to pay the GST and the tariff. 3.11 Customs has an online calculator by which people can estimate how much duty (including GST) they may need to pay. The calculator can be found using the link below: http://www.whatsmyduty.org.nz/ 3.12 New Zealand is required to have a de minimis threshold to comply with international obligations. 7 The rationale behind the de minimis is to facilitate trade and achieve a balance between the cost of collection and the revenue received. In the New Zealand context, the de minimis is set at a level under which it is estimated that the costs of collecting the duty begin to exceed the revenue the duty generates. 3.13 While collecting revenue for the Government, Customs looks to ensure that the flow of goods across the border remains as smooth and uninterrupted as possible, while still managing the risks that these goods may pose to our borders. Risks include the entry of banned or prohibited items such as drugs or objectionable material. 7 Protocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures. 10 Government consideration of the cost of collection 3.14 The Government is looking at how the collection of GST on low-value imported goods can be improved. In particular, the Minister of Customs has asked Customs to report back by October this year on: • options to strengthen and streamline GST collection on low-value goods while maintaining current levels of risk assessment; • a recalculation of the future costs of collecting GST on low-value goods; and • options to change the level of the de minimis and simplify it. 3.15 Following this report, a consultation document is anticipated to be released that will seek public feedback on options to improve the collection of GST on low-value goods, with a view to making changes to the current system of collecting GST on these goods. This could also look at the de minimis. Below is a summary of how current collection systems work and how these could be strengthened in the near future. Existing collection systems 3.16 The most common approach for collecting GST on imported goods internationally is assessment and collection by government customs authorities. This may be because GST/VAT collection by customs authorities complements their roles in processing and inspecting goods for border security purposes and in applying other duties such as tariffs (where applicable). The customs authority calculates the GST (and other duties such as tariffs) on goods entering the country and then collects the GST from the recipient of the good. 3.17 New Zealand does have elements of this approach depending on whether goods are sent via the courier or postal stream. In regard to the courier stream, courier organisations collect GST on the goods they handle and remit it to Customs. Whereas, New Zealand Post bills recipients for the GST owing on postal parcels on behalf of Customs, which is then either paid directly to Customs or via a broker. Manual processing post-border is expensive and delays delivery. New Zealand Post is now also operating a model closer to the courier approach with their YouShop business stream. 3.18 One barrier to developing more cost-effective GST collection systems for imported goods is that, unlike goods that arrive by couriers, electronic information is not currently supplied in relation to most postal mail packages or is not supplied in a format that would enable automated risk assessment and revenue collection. The information provided on mail packages and its format is set by an international organisation known as the Universal Postal Union (UPU). 3.19 Since customs authorities around the world apply similar processes for collecting GST/VAT, and are under similar information constraints, reducing the cost of processing postal parcels is an international challenge. 11 3.20 The UPU is currently considering ways of providing advanced electronic information on postal consignments to customs administrations before the goods arrive at the border. Advanced electronic information is being considered mainly for border security purposes. However, the receipt of this information could also enable more streamlined GST/VAT collection processes to take place before the good’s arrival. 3.21 If improved mechanisms for electronic data transfer on the mail stream can be implemented, New Zealand Post’s business model could shift to more closely resemble the courier business model. Customs and New Zealand Post are exploring what this might mean in the future and looking at how this approach might be progressed. Changes to the de minimis threshold 3.22 Some New Zealand businesses have requested that the Government reduce the current level of the de minimis threshold to reduce the competitive distortions it creates. As a result, Customs has been asked to look at options for simplifying and changing the level of the threshold, with a report to Ministers later in the year. This is anticipated to be followed by public consultation. 3.23 In providing this advice, the impact of additional costs for consumers (for example, brokerage fees) and the compliance implications for courier companies and New Zealand Post will need to be taken into consideration. So too will factors such as the potential increased revenue relative to the costs of collection, and the possible economic benefits for the New Zealand economy. Potential future changes to collection mechanisms 3.24 In addition to strengthening or streamlining current collection mechanisms, other collection mechanisms will need to be developed. 3.25 There has been some interest internationally in whether offshore suppliers could be required to return GST/VAT on imported goods given the success of offshore supplier registration models in relation to services and intangibles, in particular the success of the “one-stop-shop” registration systems operating in Europe. 3.26 Given that this document is proposing that offshore suppliers be required to register and return GST in relation to services and intangibles, it is currently the Government’s intention to align, where possible, the collection of GST on imported goods with the proposals in the paper relating to the collection of cross-border services and intangibles. Electronic marketplaces supplying goods could also be required to register and return the GST and tariffs as suggested for services and intangibles. 3.27 There are inherent advantages and efficiencies with applying similar systems to both services and goods, particularly for those suppliers that sell both 12 services and goods. However, we are not aware of any country having yet applied the offshore supplier registration model to low-value imported goods and, therefore, the success of its application to goods is currently uncertain. 3.28 Another option could be for New Zealand consumers to voluntarily pay the tax ahead of goods arriving in the country. However, self-assessment approaches applied in other countries have typically resulted in low compliance rates. 3.29 Looking ahead, it would appear that a combination of approaches to collecting GST would likely be required. Further work is also required to determine the viability of the options and whether they would in fact lower the cost of collection. Some key issues to be resolved are: • the extent to which the goods could be traced in a way that allows Customs, courier companies or New Zealand Post to be assured that the revenue has been collected, without a significant increase in administrative costs; • the extent to which administrative changes would be required for current government information technology systems; • how information could be shared between Inland Revenue and Customs, where GST on the goods is collected by GST-registered suppliers; and • the willingness of intermediaries – such as offshore suppliers of low- value goods to collect the tax. 3.30 As previously mentioned, readers with an interest in the collection of GST on low-value imported goods and the de minimis are invited to submit on this issue. However, it is expected that there will be further opportunity to make submissions in a subsequent consultation paper, specifically focusing on the GST treatment of low-value imported goods. Questions Your views on the following questions will help the Government in developing its views: • How does the non-collection of GST on imported goods affect you? • How do you think the collection of GST on low-value goods could be made more cost-effective while still protecting New Zealanders from imported threats? • What do you consider is the best structure and level of the de minimis threshold? 13 CHAPTER 4 A new place of supply rule 4.1 As discussed previously, the consumption of goods and services within New Zealand should be subject to GST. However, in relat ion to cross-border services and intangibles, there is some uncertainty over which country has the right to apply GST as it is often unclear where the consumption of the service or intangible occurs. Consistent with the OECD guidelines and growing international practice, it is proposed that New Zealand should apply GST to “remote” services supplied to a “New Zealand-resident”. 4.2 This chapter discusses the use of a person’s tax residence as a proxy for place of consumption and why the rules only apply to “remote” services. The chapter also discusses the legislative framework for implementing the proposal, and Chapter 5 discusses what specific services should be included or excluded from the proposed rules. Cross-border services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand-residents 4.3 The current rules for services generally apply GST only on the basis of where the services are physically performed (known as the “place of supply” rules). Supplies of services physically performed outside of New Zealand by a non-resident are not subject to GST even if they are supplied to a New Zealand-resident. 4.4 The OECD draft guidelines and growing international practice suggest that New Zealand should apply GST to cross-border services and intangibles supplied to a New Zealand-resident. This is because residence is regarded as a reasonable proxy for determining where a cross-border service or intangible will be consumed. Using residence as a proxy is also considered to be relatively simple for offshore suppliers to apply in practice. 4.5 While other proxies could be used to determine where a person consumes a cross-border service or intangible (such as the physical location of the consumer when the service is received), it is proposed that New Zealand follows international consensus. Following international guidance and practice will better ensure that cross-border services and intangibles are only subject to GST/VAT in one country, thus avoiding double taxation or double non-taxation. 14 Example Elizabeth is a resident of Country B but is on holiday in Country A. She receives and pays for a cross-border service from a supplier located in Country C. Consider the scenario where Country A applies GST on the basis of the customer’s physical location and Country B applies GST on the basis of the customer’s residency. Country A will seek to apply GST to the service since Elizabeth is located in Country A and Country B will also seek to apply GST to the service since Elizabeth is a resident of Country B. In this situation, GST may be applied to the service in two different countries. Alternatively, no country would seek to apply GST if instead Elizabeth was a resident of Country A and on holiday in Country B. 4.6 The potential for double taxation and double non-taxation is particularly evident in places like Europe where consumers can easily travel across borders. The issue is also relevant for New Zealand when New Zealand residents receive cross-border services while travelling abroad. 4.7 The proposed rules would, however, only apply to “remote” services and would exclude “on-the-spot” services. Therefore, a clear understanding of the distinction between “remote” and “on-the-spot” services, and their preferred GST treatment, is required. “Remote” and “on-the-spot” services 4.8 As well as concluding that “remote” services ought to be regarded as being consumed in the country where the recipient has his/her usual residence, OECD draft guidelines conclude that the place of consumption for “on-the- spot” services should be based on where the services are physically performed. “On-the-spot” services 4.9 On-the-spot services are services physically performed at a certain location and typically consumed at the same time and place as they are physically performed. Generally, the recipient is required to be in the same location as the supplier in order for the services to be physically performed. The OECD recommends that for these types of services, the place of physical performance generally determines the place of consumption. 4.10 The OECD lists examples of “on-the-spot” services, which include: hairdressing, massage, beauty therapy, physiotherapy, accommodation, restaurant and catering services, entry to cinema, theatre performances, trade fairs, museums, exhibitions, and parks, and attendance at sports competitions. 15 4.11 On-the-spot services that are physically performed in New Zealand are already subject to GST, and services physically performed outside New Zealand are not subject to GST. 8 The current rules relating to on-the-spot services generally produce the right outcome in that they tax consumption of services in New Zealand and do not tax consumption outside of New Zealand. Example Danny is a New Zealand resident and goes on holiday to Australia. While in Australia Danny pays for and visits a theme park. The theme park visit is considered to be an “on-the-spot” service. The OECD draft guidelines suggest that the place of consumption is in the place where the service is performed. Therefore, despite the fact that the theme park visit is consumed by a New Zealand resident, Australia has the right to tax that service. “Remote” services 4.12 Any new rule would be targeted at remote services. These services are generally not consumed at the place where they are physically performed and the recipient is not generally required to be in the same location as the supplier in order for the service to be performed. For remote services, the OECD considers that the supplier’s location does not provide a good indication of the likely place of consumption. 4.13 Instead, the place of residence of the customer is considered to be the appropriate proxy for the country in which the consumption occurs, as it can be assumed that these types of services will ordinarily be consumed in the country where the customer has his or her usual residence. 4.14 The OECD lists examples of services that could be provided remotely. These include: consultancy, accountancy and legal services, financial and insurance services, long-term rental of movable property, telecommunication and broadcasting services, online supplies of software and software maintenance, online supplies of digital content (movies, TV shows, music), digital data storage and online gaming. 4.15 To ensure New Zealand’s rules are consistent with the above principle, a new place of supply rule would be required that would apply GST to remote services supplied to a New Zealand resident. The new rule would apply when a remote service or intangible was supplied by a non-resident supplier to a New Zealand resident. 8 Note that if services are performed by a New Zealand resident they are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand (see section 8(2) of the GST Act) but will typically be zero-rated if they are performed outside New Zealand (see section 11A(1)(j) of the GST Act). 16 Example Danny often purchases and downloads songs from a website based in the United States. The song download is regarded as a “remote” service. The OECD draft guidelines suggest that the place of consumption of the song will be in New Zealand since Danny is a New Zealand resident. Therefore, New Zealand has the right to tax that service. “Place of supply” options 4.16 In general, the New Zealand GST Act adopts an iterative approach to determining the place of supply. That is, we have very broad rules for determining in the first instance whether the place of supply is in New Zealand and these are followed by a range of exclusions to determine the outcome. 9 4.17 Under this framework, there are two main options for a new place of supply rule: • Option one: Treating all supplies by a non-resident to a New Zealand resident (both remote and on-the-spot services) as being prima facie subject to GST, but then excluding the on-the-spot services by, for example, making them zero-rated; or • Option two: Only seeking to impose GST on the remote services – and treating any on-the-spot services received by a New Zealand resident offshore as being outside the GST net altogether. 4.18 Either option would make offshore suppliers liable to return GST because, at the very least, remote supplies would be treated as “taxable” for New Zealand GST purposes. Option two, however, would leave the existing settings in place for on-the-spot services, meaning that on-the-spot services performed in New Zealand would remain taxable and on-the-spot services performed outside New Zealand would not be taxable. 4.19 On balance, we consider that option two is preferable because: • It is more closely aligned with our understanding of the European Union’s approach and may therefore be more accessible to offshore suppliers. • It would obviate the need for a new zero-rating rule. On-the-spot supplies by a non-resident to a New Zealand resident offshore would be subject to the existing rules – they would be outside the scope of GST. There may be very little practical difference between zero-rated supplies and those that are not subject to GST (particularly if, as discussed in Chapter 5, zero-rated supplies do not count towards any registration threshold). However, to avoid any uncertainty, it is considered preferable to have on-the-spot suppliers that have no 9 Section 8 (Imposition of tax), section 11 (Zero-rating of goods), section 11(A) (Zero-rating of services), and section 14 (Exempt supplies). 17 connection at all with New Zealand outside the GST net in the first instance. • Either option would require some sort of definition of “remote services”, either positively or by exclusion. Option two allows on-the- spot services to be excluded from the scope of GST and other cross- border supplies by non-resident suppliers treated as “remote” and taxable (with subsequent exclusions as outlined in the next chapter). 4.20 A special input tax rule may be required if option two were to be adopted. The rule would ensure that input tax deductions would be available to offshore suppliers of on-the-spot services to the extent that the supplies would be taxable if they were made in New Zealand. This would be consistent with the business-to-business neutrality rules introduced in 2014. 10 Questions Do you agree with the proposed approach for taxing cross-border services and intangibles? Do you think an approach that distinguishes between “remote” and “on-the-spot” services will produce the right outcomes and do you consider there will be problems in practice in making this distinction? Do you prefer an approach that excludes on-the-spot services so they are outside New Zealand’s tax net, or an approach that treats all supplies as being subject to GST, but then excludes on-the-spot services by making them zero-rated? 10 See section 20(3L) of the GST Act. 18 CHAPTER 5 Services included and excluded 5.1 Before considering which offshore suppliers might be required to register and return GST (discussed in the next chapter), it is important to consider what services are included and whether there should be any exceptions to the proposed rules. 5.2 It is proposed that the new rules would cover a broad range of services wit h the main exceptions being for supplies to New Zealand-registered businesses, as well as for existing exemptions and zero-rated provisions that currently apply to domestic suppliers. To ensure neutrality is maintained, it is critical that supplies by non-residents and resident businesses are placed on an equivalent footing. Services included 5.3 The definition of “services” in the GST Act includes anything other than physical goods or money. It is proposed that any new place of supply rule would, subject to the stated exceptions, cover services as defined in the Act. 5.4 This is a broad definition, and in the context of supplies of remote services and intangibles, would include digital services that are typically electronically delivered (such as digital downloads, online music and video streaming services, online gaming and other digital services), as well as more traditional cross-border services supplied remotely by a person offshore (such as professional advice like legal and accountancy services). 5.5 While some countries have limited their rules to digital services only, in the New Zealand context we consider a broader definition of services would be more appropriate. If the rule was limited to digital services there is a risk that the rule could: • Bias consumer decisions on whether to purchase digital or non-digital services. For example, the rules may create an artificial distinction between a legal opinion produced by a non-resident that is provided via email and one that is sent through the postal service. (Ideally, tax should not influence people’s decisions to purchase a particular type of service or influence the delivery method of a particular service). • Make the rules more complex as suppliers would be required to determine whether a supply of services is “digital” and therefore subject to GST. 5.6 As ment ioned above, a broad definition of “services” is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system and is also consistent with the approach recently announced in Australia. (See attached appendix for more information.) 19 Supplies to GST-registered New Zealand-resident businesses 5.7 An important consideration in looking at the scope of any new rules is whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST in relat ion to: • both supplies to New Zealand consumers (business-to-consumer supplies) and registered businesses (business-to-business supplies); or • to business-to-consumer supplies only. 5.8 In Europe, similar rules are limited to business-to-consumer supplies. This approach is also more consistent with the OECD draft guidelines. However, other countries (such as South Africa) have applied the rules to both business-to-consumer and business-to-business supplies, one reason being to reduce the compliance costs associated with suppliers having to distinguish between individual consumers and businesses. 5.9 There are, however, a number of perceived advantages in applying the rules only to business-to-consumer supplies: • From a revenue perspective there is little value in applying GST to business-to-business supplies. This is because New Zealand businesses, if registered, would be able to claim back any GST they were charged by an offshore supplier to the extent the GST costs were incurred in making taxable supplies. • Tax invoice requirements could be relaxed because no New Zealand consumers charged wit h GST would be in a position to claim back the GST. Relaxed invoice requirements would lower compliance costs for offshore suppliers. • There are some fiscal risks associated with applying GST to business- to-business supplies as less reputable offshore suppliers may purport to charge GST but not return the GST. Registered New Zealand businesses would then seek to claim the GST back in the normal manner. • If the rules applied to business-to-business supplies there could in some cases be timing disadvantages for New Zealand businesses if they charged GST and then had to claim that GST back. This could be particularly problematic in relation to high value business-to-business supplies (for example, a high-value software package purchased by a New Zealand business). • The European Union, which has applied an offshore supplier registration system since 2003, only requires offshore suppliers to return GST on business-to-consumer supplies. Considering the size of this market, it is likely that suppliers would have built systems to operate in this environment. Therefore, this option may be more readily accepted by offshore suppliers. • The approach proposed in Australia is also limited to business-to- consumer supplies and there will be inherent advantages with adopting similar rules, particularly for offshore suppliers that supply services to Australia and New Zealand. 20 5.10 There are, however, some disadvantages in applying the rules only to business-to-consumer supplies: • Excluding business-to-business supplies would mean offshore suppliers would be required to determine whether they were supplying to a business or an individual consumer. This could be difficult and may impose compliance costs on suppliers. • Revenue could be foregone if individuals represented themselves as a registered business and were able to avoid the GST. 5.11 There are pros and cons to each approach and submissions are sought on which approach is preferred. 5.12 If business-to-business supplies are included, consideration would need to be given to the invo ice requirements that would be placed on offshore suppliers to enable business recipients to claim back the GST. This would involve a trade-off between the need to make requirements simple for offshore suppliers but for sufficient information to be held by domestic businesses to substantiate input tax claims. 5.13 Alternatively, if business-to-business supplies are excluded, these supplies may need to be treated as zero-rated supplies. This would ensure that any New Zealand GST incurred in relation to these supplies could be claimed back by the offshore supplier. In addit ion, submissions are sought on whether offshore suppliers that solely supply services to New Zealand- registered businesses would be required to register and whether these supplies would be included in calculating the registration threshold (as discussed in the next chapter). Example Ad Co is an offshore supplier of online advertising services. Ad Co supplies advertising services to New Zealand businesses all of whom are GST-registered. If business-to-business supplies are excluded, Ad Co would not be required to register for New Zealand GST as it only makes supplies to GST-registered businesses. If Ad Co decided to voluntarily register, the services it supplies could be zero-rated for GST purposes and Ad Co would be able to claim back any New Zealand GST it incurs on its costs in the course of making those supplies. 5.14 In many instances, offshore suppliers would be able to assume their services were being received by individual consumers given the nature of their supplies. Chapter 7 discusses how offshore suppliers would practically be able to determine whether their customer was a registered business if business-to-business supplies are excluded. 21 How the rules apply to certain supplies 5.15 As we have noted, the legislation would need to ensure that a non-resident is not materially disadvantaged or advantaged compared with a New Zealand- resident business making comparable supplies. This would ensure that GST remains fair and equitable. In particular there would need to be comparable treatment for: • exempt supplies; • zero-rated supplies; and • specific industries. Exempt services 5.16 Services that are already exempt from New Zealand GST should retain that character irrespective of the residence of the supplier. New Zealand has a very broad-based GST system, wit h very few exemptions. The main exemptions are the supply of financial services to final consumers (financial services to businesses would be excluded by the business-to-business exclusion discussed above) and residential accommodation. 11 Having few exemptions should make it easier for offshore suppliers to comply with the New Zealand GST system compared wit h countries that have many exemptions. Zero-rated services 5.17 It is proposed that supplies currently zero-rated for domestic suppliers be similarly zero-rated for non-resident suppliers. In these situations, the consumption is generally attributed to a location outside New Zealand and therefore should not be subject to New Zealand GST. An example would be services supplied directly in connection with land or other immoveable property that is located outside New Zealand. 12 5.18 In saying this, the interaction between a non-resident registration system and the current zero-rating rules would need to be reviewed in detail to ensure that remote services received by New Zealand residents or otherwise consumed in New Zealand are not inappropriately zero-rated. Specific industries 5.19 The GST Act contains some special rules that allow certain industries to pay GST on the net value of their supplies (payments received less payments made) – principally the gambling and insurance industries. Any new rules would need to ensure that the overall policy objective of putting resident and non-resident suppliers on a relatively even footing is also applied to these industries. This may require special rules such as, in the insurance context, switching off input tax deductions for payments received by an offshore insurance provider if no GST is returned on payments received because the 11 Section 14 of the GST Act contains the current exemptions from GST. 12 Section 11A of the GST Act contains services that are zero-rated. 22 recipient is a New Zealand-registered business (assuming business-to- business supplies are excluded). Questions Do you consider that a rule that covers a wide range of services is appropriate for New Zealand, and do you foresee any problems with such a broad approach in practice? Do you prefer an approach that only taxes business-to-consumer supplies or an approach that taxes both business-to-consumer and business-to-business supplies? Do you consider that the other proposed exclusions for services and intangibles supplied by a non-resident should ensure that non-residents and resident suppliers received comparable treatment? 23 CHAPTER 6 Requirement for suppliers to register This chapter discusses the proposed registration threshold that could be 6.1 applied to offshore suppliers, and situat ions when an electronic marketplace might be required to register instead of the principal supplier. Registration threshold Currently, domestic businesses are required to register and return GST if 6.2 their turnover exceeds $60,000 in a 12-month period. They are also able to voluntarily register if their turnover falls below that amount. While the registration threshold could be considered as an exception to New Zealand’s broad-based GST policy, as some suppliers would not be required to register and return GST, it is intended to reduce compliance costs for very small businesses. For similar reasons, a registration threshold is also likely to be favoured by 6.3 offshore suppliers and could be either based on supplies to New Zealand residents or on worldwide supplies. The main benefit of a registration threshold for offshore suppliers is that it 6.4 will lower the compliance costs for small suppliers and suppliers that do not supply many services to New Zealand residents. For some suppliers, the compliance costs of registering and returning GST may outweigh the revenue collected in supplying services to New Zealand residents. As far as possible, given their objectives, any new rules should be designed in a way that does not pose a barrier to trade with New Zealand. There are, however, some disadvantages with a threshold that is too high: 6.5 • It would be possible for some offshore suppliers to break up their supplies into different entities in order to stay under the registration threshold. This behaviour is likely to be easily identified in the domestic context but may be more difficult to identify abroad. • If a non-resident is making supplies into New Zealand, it is likely that this is just part of their global market. If each country was to have a high registration threshold, this may mean some reasonably large businesses (in terms of their global supplies) could escape having to register anywhere. This may result in them having a competitive advantage over similarly sized domestic businesses and larger international businesses. • Our proposals are intended to ensure that domestic suppliers compete on a level playing field with offshore suppliers. However, a threshold based on that which applies to domestic suppliers may not necessarily result in competitive neutrality. This is because in some countries offshore suppliers may not incur GST or VAT, or will be able to claim any GST or VAT costs back in their home country in the process of 24 exporting services to New Zealand residents. In contrast, domest ic businesses below the registration threshold that are not registered are not able to claim back their GST costs. Similarly, domestic suppliers that have voluntarily registered would be able to claim back GST costs but would also be required to return GST on any supplies they make. The countries that have introduced offshore supplier registration systems 6.6 have typically adopted low or nil thresholds. European Union countries have no thresholds, South Africa has a threshold of R50,000 (around NZD$6,000), and Norway has a threshold of NOK50,000 (around NZD$9,000). Submissions are sought on the level of the registration threshold, specifically 6.7 whether a lower threshold (such as NZD$10,000) or a threshold based on the domestic registration threshold (NZD$60,000) is preferred. If business-to-business supplies are excluded from the proposed rules, 6.8 submissions are also sought on whether supplies to New Zealand-resident businesses should count towards this threshold. Electronic marketplace In some instances, offshore suppliers would not directly supply services to 6.9 their customers. Instead they may use an electronic marketplace to market and sell their services or intangibles. For example, an app developer may make their app available on a mobile app store. In these situations, it is proposed that the electronic marketplace would be treated as the supplier and be required to register. The electronic marketplace is generally in a better position to register and 6.10 return GST on supplies compared wit h the underlying supplier. Typically, the electronic marketplace would be larger, better resourced and have a closer relat ionship wit h the customer. Requiring the electronic marketplace to register may also reduce compliance costs, as potentially, a large number of smaller suppliers may not be required to register. It is anticipated that the marketplace and the underlying supplier will have commercial arrangements in place that could take any GST costs into account. Requiring intermediaries to register for GST in this context has been a 6.11 relatively recent international development. Australia announced proposed rules that would require an operator of an “electronic distribution service” to register and return the GST. This will occur when the operator controls any of the key elements of the supply such as delivery, charging or terms and conditions. These proposed rules are broadly modelled on similar rules currently in operation in the European Union and Norway. To ensure these rules are easily applied in practice, it is important to clearly 6.12 define the circumstances in which the electronic marketplace would be required to register, and therefore, the underlying supplier would not be required to register. Wit hout this clarit y there is a risk that both parties may register or fail to register. 25 It is proposed that an electronic marketplace would be required to register 6.13 when customers would normally consider the marketplace to be the supplier, and this is reflected in the contractual arrangements between the parties. This is likely to be when the marketplace: • authorises the charge to the customer; • authorises delivery to the customer; or • sets the terms and conditions of the transaction. It would be expected that an offshore supplier simply using a payment 6.14 service provider to organise the payment from the customer would still be required to register. In this situation, the payment service provider would have a limited role in the supply chain. However, if for example an offshore supplier listed services or intangibles on a third-party website and that website interacted directly with the customer, and organised payment and delivery for any purchases, that website would be required to register, charge and return GST, instead of the principal supplier. It is important to note however that the underlying suppliers may still be 6.15 required to register in relat ion to supplies to New Zealand residents not connected with the electronic marketplace. Questions What do you consider is an appropriate registration thresho ld for offshore suppliers? Should business-to-business supplies count towards the registration threshold? Should electronic marketplaces be required to register in certain situations instead of the principal supplier? What factors do you think are important when determining whether an electronic marketplace should be required to register? 26 CHAPTER 7 Information, compliance and enforcement under the proposed rules 7.1 This chapter discusses other key features and the practical application of the proposed new rules, specifically: • How will offshore suppliers identify New Zealand-resident consumers and, if business-to-business supplies are excluded, how will offshore suppliers identify New Zealand-registered businesses? • What if a consumer incorrectly represents themselves as a foreign resident or a New Zealand-registered business? • If business-to-business supplies are excluded, when would the existing reverse charge rule apply? • If business-to-business supplies are excluded, what if a New Zealand- registered business is inadvertently charged GST? • Enforcement of the proposed rules. Identification of New Zealand-resident consumers 7.2 Assuming business-to-business suppliers are excluded, the proposed rules would only apply to services supplied to New Zealand tax residents who are not registered for GST. Consequent ly, before charging GST on a supply, an offshore supplier would be required to determine whether their customer is: • a New Zealand tax resident; and • registered for New Zealand GST. Tax residence 7.3 One of the main aspects of the proposed rule is that it would apply only to services received by New Zealand tax residents. A New Zealand tax resident is generally a person who is in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period or has a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand. 13 7.4 A company is generally considered to be resident in New Zealand if it meets any one of the following criteria: • It is incorporated in New Zealand. • Control by company directors is exercised in New Zealand. • It has its centre of management in New Zealand. • It has its head office in New Zealand. 14 13 Section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Section YD 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 27 7.5 It would not be expected that offshore suppliers would be required to know precisely the tax residency status of their customers. Instead, offshore suppliers would be able to use proxies as evidence to identify whether a customer is a resident of New Zealand. Examples of the type of proxies recommended by the OECD and used in other countries that have similar rules include: • the billing address of the customer; • the home address of the customer; • the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the device used by the customer; • the customer’s bank details; • the location of the originating payment for the service; and • the location of the customer’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied, if applicable. 7.6 The proxies relevant for determining the residency of the customer may depend upon the type of service being supplied. Proxies will be particularly relevant for suppliers of digital services, as the supplier and the customer are unlikely to have a close relationship. However, it is likely that for the more traditional cross-border services, such as professional advice, the supplier and customer will have a closer relationship and therefore the supplier will be better able to determine the residency status of the consumer. 7.7 In the European Union, the supplier is required to have two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to determine the residency of the customer. Australia’s proposed rules require the supplier to take reasonable steps to obtain information concerning whether the recipient of the supply is an Australian consumer, and after taking these steps, reasonably believe that the recipient is not an Australian consumer. 7.8 There is a trade-off between imposing compliance costs on offshore suppliers to accurately determine the residency of their customers, and having proxies which will, in the vast majority of cases, produce the right outcome. Consideration would need to be given to how susceptible to error some proxies may be and therefore whether they should be able to be used by offshore suppliers to determine the customer’s residency. 7.9 While both models have their merits, we consider the option that imposes the lowest compliance costs on non-resident businesses should be preferred. Allowing non-resident businesses to rely on information they collect as part of their standard business practices appears to meet this objective better than one that requires these businesses to make further enquiries about individual customers. In saying this: • the rules should focus on the customer residency indicators that are least susceptible to error; and • the supplier should not be able to rely on location proxies which provide less accurate outcomes if better information can be relatively simply obtained. 28 New Zealand-registered businesses 7.10 If offshore suppliers are required to return GST in relation to business-to- business supplies, they will not need to identify whether their customer is a GST-registered business. 7.11 Assuming that the proposed rules will not require offshore suppliers to return GST in relation to services supplied to GST-registered New Zealand businesses, offshore suppliers, in many instances, would be able to presume the services were being received by individual consumers, given the nature of their supplies. 7.12 For services that could be received by either businesses or non-registered consumers, it is proposed that the default position should be that GST is charged. New Zealand GST-registered businesses should be able to provide their Inland Revenue Department (IRD) number to the offshore supplier to prove that they are in fact a registered business. However, registered businesses should not provide their IRD number to the supplier if the services received do not relate to their business activity. 7.13 Suppliers would be able to rely on the provision of an IRD number as evidence of GST registration and would not be required to charge GST on these supplies. However, the supplier would also be required to keep sufficient records of the IRD numbers provided by business customers for auditing purposes. Incorrect representations by consumers 7.14 There is a risk that some consumers may incorrectly represent themselves as a registered business customer (if business-to-business supplies are excluded) or a resident consumer of another country and avoid being charged GST. 7.15 There are two ways this issue could be addressed: • First, existing “knowledge offences” could apply if a consumer knowingly supplied incorrect information to a supplier in order to avoid being charged GST. 15 • Secondly, it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue have the discretion (which is expected to be limited to more egregious cases) to require the consumer to register for GST and treat the consumer as having made the supply from the time the recipient purchased the service. 7.16 The knowledge offences apply when a person knowingly provides altered, false, incomplete, or misleading information to any person in respect of a tax law or a matter or thing relating to a tax law. A person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable to a fine up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence, or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. 15 See section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 29 7.17 In relat ion to requiring the recipient of the service to register, similar rules already exist in relation to land transactions when land was incorrectly zero- rated. 16 In these situations the recipient would be required to return the GST and, since the supply is treated as being made at the date of purchase, the recipient may be subject to use-of-money interest, with any applicable penalties calculated from that date. Reverse charge 7.18 The consumption of goods and services in New Zealand should be subject to GST. However, GST should not be a tax on businesses. To achieve this, registered businesses are able to claim back GST charged on goods and services they receive to the extent the goods and services are used for, or available for use in, making taxable supplies. 17 In contrast, final consumers are unable to claim back any GST. 7.19 However, registered businesses may purchase goods and services for non- taxable purposes, such as for private or exempt activities. In these situations, the business cannot claim back the GST as the goods and services received do not relate to the making of taxable supplies. In effect, the business is treated like a final consumer. 7.20 In the context of registered businesses purchasing services from an offshore supplier that do not relate to the making of taxable supplies, and assuming that business-to-business supplies are excluded from the proposed rules, New Zealand’s existing “reverse charge” rule 18 should apply to tax those services or intangibles. This would ensure that businesses receiving services and intangibles from an offshore supplier, other than for making taxable supplies, are treated in the same way as individual consumers. 7.21 The European Union operates a broad reverse charge which requires registered businesses to return VAT on the total value of the service received regardless of whether the service relates to the making of non-taxable or taxable supplies. Businesses are then able to claim back the VAT that relates to their taxable activities in the usual way. The ability to offset the portion of VAT that relates to their taxable activities means the VAT is only payable on the services that relate to their non-taxable activities. 7.22 While the European Union system has been considered, arguably the same outcome can be achieved with the more limited reverse charge with less compliance costs imposed on domestic businesses. 7.23 If offshore suppliers are required to return GST in relation to business-to- business supplies, consideration would need to be given to whether the existing reverse charge should be repealed or better integrated into the proposed rules. 16 See section 5(23) and section 51B(4) of the GST Act. 17 See section 20(3C) of the GST Act – Input tax may be deductible. 18 See section 8(4B) of the GST Act – Deemed supply in New Zealand by recipient of imported services. 30 Application of the reverse charge 7.24 New Zealand’s existing reverse charge treats a GST-registered recipient as having made the supply in New Zealand and therefore requires it to return the GST on the supply instead of the offshore supplier. This means that the recipient returns output tax on the full value of the supply (as the deemed supplier), but only claims an input tax deduction to the extent the service is used for making taxable supplies. The net result is that output tax on the non-taxable use is paid by the recipient. 7.25 The reverse charge only applies to the extent the services relate to non- taxable activities, such as private activities or exempt supplies, and the current 5 percent de minimis rule would be retained. Example Virginia is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a software package from an offshore supplier for $400. Assuming business-to -business supplies are excluded, she identifies herself as a registered business and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the software 50 percent for her taxable project management services and 50 percent for home/recreational use. Under the reverse charge, Virginia is treated as making a supply to herself of $400 at the 15 percent rate. She must return output tax of $60 ($400 x 15 percent). However, Virginia can claim an input deduction for the portion of the value of the software package (50 percent) that is attributed to her taxable use. This input deduction is $30. Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of $30 ($60 output tax minus $30 input tax). If Virginia’s use of the software package had been 95 percent taxable or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. New Zealand businesses being inadvertently charged GST 7.26 Assuming that business-to-business supplies are excluded from the proposed new rules, there could be some instances when an offshore supplier may inadvertently charge a registered New Zealand business GST. 7.27 In these situations, the business would be required to contact the offshore supplier in order to receive a refund of the incorrectly charged GST. It is not proposed that businesses would be able to claim GST back in their normal GST return. This is because offshore suppliers will not be required to provide a full tax invoice and therefore it would be difficult to verify whether GST had been charged and returned. 31 7.28 Offshore suppliers would be able to adjust their output tax in a GST return, subsequent to the refund being made, to take into account the overpaid GST. Consistent with the general rules for claiming input deductions under section 20 of the GST Act, it is proposed that these adjustments would, subject to existing exceptions, be required to be made within two years of the original supply. Enforcement 7.29 New Zealand’s tax system works on the principle that the vast majorit y of people do the right thing and comply with their tax obligations. This is largely because our tax system is fair and coherent. It is expected that most offshore suppliers would co mply wit h our rules for the same reasons. 7.30 When similar rules to those proposed in this document have been applied in other countries, offshore suppliers, particularly large international suppliers that account for the majority of cross-border services and intangibles, have demonstrated a willingness to comply. 7.31 To generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand we have aimed to adopt similar and consistent rules with the rules that apply in other countries. 7.32 For offshore suppliers that do not comply, the normal enforcement rules and penalties that apply to New Zealand suppliers are expected to apply. The Commissioner is able to register a supplier who is liable to register from the date the person first became liable to register or a later date as the Commissioner considers equitable, 19 and a supplier is deemed to be registered if it claims that GST is being charged on their supplies but is in fact not registered and not returning the GST. 20 7.33 The OECD also envisages countries cooperating and sharing information to ensure that suppliers comply with registration requirements in different jurisdictions. For example, New Zealand is a signatory to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. The Convention is a multilateral instrument available for all forms of tax cooperation to tackle tax evasion and avoidance. The Convention has a very wide scope and covers all forms of compulsory payments, including GST/VAT. 7.34 Like many other countries, New Zealand has a large network of double tax agreements. These agreements allow for informat ion-sharing, which normally includes GST/VAT. 19 See section 51(4) of the GST Act – Commissioner to determine registration. 20 See section 51B(1) of the GST Act – Person treated as registered. 32 Questions What proxies do you consider would be appropriate to use in order for offshore suppliers to determine the residency of their customers? What proxies are likely to be most accessible in practice? To what extent should offshore suppliers be required to accurately determine the residency o f its customers and how much evidence should suppliers be required to obtain? If business-to-business supplies are excluded, will offshore suppliers be able to easily distinguish between individuals and GST-registered businesses in practice and what compliance costs would this impose on them? Do you agree with the sanctions proposed for incorrect representations by consumers? If business-to-business supplies are excluded, do you agree with the application of the reverse charge as suggested? If business-to-business supplies are excluded, New Zealand businesses will be required to recover any inadvertently charged GST from the offshore supplier. Do you agree with this approach? 33 CHAPTER 8 Registration and return filing 8.1 This chapter considers the registration system and filing periods that offshore suppliers would use if they are required to register for New Zealand GST. There are three different registration options that could be adopted: • the domestic registration system; • a “pay only” registration system; or • a regional “one-stop-shop” registration system. 8.2 This chapter does not recommend any specific option but the option chosen will be made clear in advance of the implementation date of any new rules. Domestic registration system 8.3 New Zealand’s current registration system applies to domestic businesses and so me non-resident businesses. In order to register, businesses will need to obtain a New Zealand IRD number and then either fill out a registration application form or register online through a system called myIR. Once registered, the business is required to file GST returns every month, two months, or six months depending upon the business’s turnover. 21 Returns can be either filed manually or online through myIR. In addit ion to accounting for GST on taxable supplies, domest ic businesses can also claim back any GST they incur on costs if those costs relate to the making of taxable supplies. 8.4 One option for registering offshore suppliers is simply to use the existing registration system. Since New Zealand’s GST system is broad-based with few exemptions, it is relatively simple and easy to comply with and this is reflected in the simplicity of the return itself. Offshore suppliers would be able to return GST on their supplies of services to New Zealand-resident customers and also claim back any New Zealand GST they may incur in the making of taxable supplies. 8.5 Using the existing registration system would also keep administrative costs to a minimum since administrative processes have already been developed. However, ideally, if input tax deductions were being claimed, any system that adopted existing systems may need to include elements of the existing registration system for non-residents introduced in 2014. These rules reflect the unique revenue risk associated with allowing non-residents to claim input deductions, and include measures such as allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue longer to process any refund claims. 21 A person must file returns monthly if taxable supplies in a 12- month period are more, or likely to be more than $24,000,000. If turnover is less than $500,000 in a 12-month period a person is able to file every six months. 34 8.6 One disadvantage to using the domestic registration system is the fact that the domestic system is not tailored to the specific needs of offshore suppliers. The majority of offshore suppliers are unlikely to incur any New Zealand expenses and therefore will not need to claim back any GST. Consequently, much of the current GST return that is focused on GST claims may not be relevant for those suppliers that are in a pay-only position. 8.7 This system could, however, be implemented relatively quickly and could potentially be used in the first instance unt il a more tailored system was developed. “Pay only” registration system 8.8 “Pay-only” registration systems are tailored for offshore suppliers that have no GST/VAT to claim and make payments only. The main benefit of a pay- only system is that the system can be very simple. Since these offshore suppliers are not claiming any GST they are relatively low-risk fro m a revenue perspective. The usual checks and balances focussed on ensuring that input tax deductions/refund claims are correct can be relaxed. The processes and information requirements around registering for GST could also be simplified. 8.9 It is likely that the majority of offshore suppliers would only need to register under a pay-only system as they will not normally incur any New Zealand GST on their purchases. However, some offshore suppliers will incur New Zealand GST (for example, a non-resident may visit New Zealand to conduct market research and may incur GST in the process) and so should have the opportunity to register under the domestic system and claim the GST back. Therefore, the system would need to accommodate two potential types of registration, as shown in the diagram below: Offshore supplier Domestic registrationPay-only registration New Zealand- resident customers Has or will the offshore supplier incur any New Zealand GST on its purchases? Supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents NoYes Registration Options 35 8.10 Some countries have adopted pay-only registration systems, most notably Norway. Australia has suggested that it may seek to develop a similar system. The OECD draft guidelines recommend that, as far as possible, countries develop simplified registration systems for offshore suppliers, such as a pay-only registration system. Regional registration system 8.11 The European Union operates a “one-stop-shop” for suppliers that supply to multiple European Member States. Under the one-stop-shop suppliers are able to register in a single Member State. This is an alternative to registering in every Member State to which they make supplies. 8.12 All VAT collected by the offshore supplier is returned to that single Member State, which is responsible for redistributing the VAT revenue to the Member States where the consumption took place. The Member State is, in part, responsible for auditing offshore suppliers that register with that State. 8.13 The intention of developing such a system was to lower the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and to enhance voluntary compliance with the system as a who le. Registering and filing a single return with one Member State is considered to be easier than registering and filing in multiple Member States. 8.14 New Zealand is not part of a common market, but, similar benefits could be achieved through a comparable “one-stop-shop”. For example, if an offshore supplier supplied services or intangibles to both Australia and New Zealand, a “one-stop-shop” registration system would allow the supplier to register and file returns in a single country, instead of both countries. 8.15 There are however some drawbacks to this approach. Countries would need to agree to develop “one-stop-shops” and rely on another country to be responsible for collecting and distributing the GST. It would also be preferable that similar rules be adopted in each country that signs up to such a scheme. Countries can individually be expected to have very different tax bases and tax rates. However, administrative rules like registration thresholds and filing periods may need to be consistent for the system to operate easily in practice and ensure compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers are kept to a minimum. Taxable periods 8.16 It will be necessary to establish the GST filing frequency of registered non- residents. At present, the default taxable period for a registered person is two months. Larger businesses, with an annual turnover of $24 million or more, are required to file monthly, whereas smaller businesses can elect to file on a six-monthly basis. For non-residents, there are effectively two options: 36 • mandating a taxable period that will apply to all registrations; or • allowing the normal rules to apply, so filing frequency will depend on the size of the business concerned. 8.17 On balance, it is proposed for now that there be a set period for non-resident registrations and that period should be two-monthly. In reaching this view it is important to note that, if the preferred registration option uses existing Inland Revenue systems, any mandated taxable period must be a period that is already specified in legislation: monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly. 8.18 A set period would provide certainty for affected businesses. It would also make any tailored pay-only registration system easier to design and to use, because the same rules would apply to everyone required to use it. 8.19 By contrast, applying the standard rules would require registered persons to work out which filing period applied to them. Rules would need to clarify, for the purposes of the one and six-monthly options, what supplies were counted towards the relevant thresholds. In that case it could be assumed that, whenever possible, a non-resident would apply for a six-monthly period to maximise any timing advantages. This would affect revenue collection and increase administration costs because applications would have to be manually processed in order to determine whether the requirements for six- monthly filing were met in each case. Questions Of the three options discussed, which registration system do you prefer? What compliance costs would be imposed on offshore suppliers if they were required to register under the domestic registration system? Do you consider there would be significant benefits in developing a “pay-only” registration system? Do you consider there would be significant benefits in pursuing a regional “one-stop- shop” registration system? Do you prefer a fixed filing time for offshore suppliers or variable filing times that depend upon the offshore supplier’s turnover? 37 APPENDIX International adoption of the offshore supplier registration model The offshore supplier registration model is being used to collect GST on imported services by the European Union and in some other countries, including Norway, Switzerland, South Korea, South Africa, and soon Japan and Australia. The countries that have implemented these regimes report some success in collecting the GST on cross-border services. Some parallels can also be drawn with recent sales tax proposals in the United States. The following summary details how other countries have approached the issue. European Union Since 1 July 2003, the European Unio n has required offshore suppliers to register and return VAT for supplies of services to European Union consumers (business-to- consumer supplies). To lower the compliance costs on offshore suppliers, a simplified registration system is available (known as the “one-stop-shop”), where offshore suppliers are able to register in a single Member State. This is an alternative to registering in every Member State to which they make supplies. All VAT collected by the offshore supplier is returned to that single Member State, with VAT amounts for each Member State reported, and the Member State of registration is responsible for redistributing the VAT revenue to the Member States where the consumption took place. The Member State is in part responsible for auditing offshore suppliers that register with that State. In terms of supplies of services and intangible goods between Member States, before 1 January 2015, suppliers returned VAT on an origin basis (returning VAT to the Member State in which they made the supply as opposed to where the consumption took place). This resulted in suppliers (foreign and domestic) locating branches in Member States with low VAT rates. The supplier would then be able to contract with the EU consumers from that branch and return a lower rate of VAT to the Member State in which the branch was located. However, since 1 January 2015, this type of tax planning is less attractive as European Union suppliers are required to return VAT based on the rate that applies in the Member State where the consumption takes place (on a destination basis, which is consistent with supplies from offshore). The rules apply to telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services. In order to lower compliance costs, European Unio n suppliers will also be able to use the one-stop-shop scheme. 38 In regard to offshore supplies of services and intangibles to business customers (business-to-business supplies), the business customer is liable to account for VAT through a reverse charge. That is, the business customer itself will account for the VAT in the business customer’s jurisdiction. Norway Since July 2011, the Norwegian Tax Administration has required offshore suppliers of e-services (including digital goods) to register and return VAT on supplies to Norwegian consumers. Like the European Union, VAT on business-to-business supplies is accounted for by the business receiving the services under a reverse charge mechanism. Norway operates a simplified registration and filing system for non-residents in a “pay-only” position. Norway also allows non-residents to register under the ordinary domestic system if, for example, the non-resident wishes to claim back any Norwegian VAT that they may have incurred. Switzerland Since 2010, Switzerland has required offshore suppliers who supply more than CHF100,000 (around NZD$150,000) of telecommunications or electronic services to Swiss consumers to register for VAT. When measuring the threshold, offshore suppliers only count their supplies to Swiss customers who are not registered for VAT (for example, non-business customers), but once the offshore supplier is registered for VAT they are required to charge VAT on all their supplies in Switzerland (including supplies to business customers). A reverse charge applies to business consumers when the offshore supplier is not registered. “Electronic services” is broadly defined and includes providing web-hosting, text and images, databases, software, music, movie, games and gambling electronically over the internet. South Africa One of the most recent examples of a country adopting the offshore supplier registration model is South Africa. From 1 June 2014, non-resident suppliers of certain electronic services to South African residents are required to register and account for VAT if the total value of taxable supplies exceeds R50,000 (almost NZD$6,000). Electronic services include online gambling, subscriptions and most downloads. The registration threshold is the same as the domestic threshold for voluntary registration. Once registered, the offshore supplier is required to return GST in respect of both suppliers to businesses and consumers. Offshore suppliers can use the customer’s address, or the location of the customer’s bank account (where the payment originates from), to determine the customer’s residency. 39 Australia On 12 May 2015, as part of its Budget, the Australian Government announced that it will apply GST to digital products and other services imported by Australian consumers from 1 July 2017. A draft Bill and explanatory material have been released for consultation until 7 July 2015. The rules are broadly modelled on similar rules currently in operation in the European Union and Norway, and follow OECD guidance. Below is a short summary of the proposed rules: • The proposed rules apply broadly to all services to Australian residents. This will mean supplies of digital products, such as streaming or downloading of movies, music, apps, games, e-books as well as other services such as consultancy and professional services will be subject to GST. Goods and real property are excluded. • The proposed rules only apply to supplies to Australian consumers. An Australian consumer is broadly an Australian resident other than a business. This means GST will only apply to business-to-consumer supplies. The explanatory material notes that the Australian Taxation Office will work with taxpayers to agree what steps need to be taken to determine whether a customer is an Australian consumer. • The explanatory material notes that the existing reverse charge (where registered business customers return the GST) will broadly apply to tax the supply in situations when a business receives the services for non-taxable purposes. • In some circumstances, responsibility for the GST liability may be shifted from the supplier to the operator of an electronic distribution service. This will occur where the operator controls any of the key elements of the supply such as delivery, charging or terms and conditions. Shifting responsibility for the GST liability to operators is intended to minimise compliance costs as operators are generally better placed to comply. • The proposed rules permit the making of regulations to provide for simplified GST registration for offshore suppliers. These amendments appear to be aimed at simplifying the administrative burden for offshore suppliers caught by the proposed rules to promote compliance. • The proposed rules allow offshore suppliers to elect for a “limited registration” which prevents offshore suppliers from claiming input tax credits. This will further simply the registration and remittance process. South Korea From 1 July 2015, offshore suppliers are required to charge and return VAT on electronically supplied services (for example, applications, MP3, music, films) to Korean recipients. The affected digital services include streaming services, program updates, remote service provision (such as news, traffic information), software and electronic documents. 40 South Korea has a simplified registration system in order to encourage compliance. The new rules apply to both business-to-business and business-to-customer supplies, and offshore service providers will be exempt from the requirement to issue VAT invoices to Korean customers. Japan From 1 October 2015, Japan is likely to enact legislation that will require offshore non-residents that provide services to Japanese consumers to register for Japanese consumption tax. The United States The United States does not operate a national VAT/GST; instead, individual states apply sales taxes and use taxes to most goods and some services at rates that vary from state to state. Currently, retailers are only required to collect sales and use taxes for states where they have a physical presence. The Marketplace Fairness Act is proposed legislation pending in the United States Congress that would enable states to collect sales taxes and use taxes fro m remote retailers with no physical presence in their state. However, to address compliance cost concerns, states would only be granted this authority after they have simplified their sales tax regimes. States can simplify their sales tax regimes in a number of ways. Many states have signed up to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement which, among other simplification measures, allows the state to use a centralised, electronic registration system. 41
GST: CROSS- BORDER SERVICES, INTANGIBLES AND GOODS 2 | Table of Contents 3 9 12 16 19 page page page page page 22 25 27 page page page Background and proposal Imported low-value goods Services covered Who should register? Enforcement Registration and filing Identifying New Zealand customers Place of supply rules Background and proposal 4 | Implications of non-collection ​GST should apply evenly to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand as this helps to ensure that GST is fair, efficient and simple. At present imported services and low-value goods are not subject to GST. ​The growth in online shopping has benefitted New Zealand by giving consumers access to a wider market and increasing competition in the domestic retail market. However, ideally, tax treatment should not be a consideration in consumers’ purchasing decisions. When GST does not apply evenly, it may bias consumer decisions, which could lead to unfair and inefficient outcomes. ​(The examples in this document assume the consumer is purchasing a software programme for NZ$10, to which GST will be added if appropriate.) All things being equal, the New Zealand consumer will purchase from the non-resident supplier in preference to the New Zealand supplier. The uneven GST treatment has biased consumer behaviour. New Zealand Country X Software Co NZ Software Ltd $10 (no GST) $11.50 (incl GST) 5 | International developments ​The OECD has developed draft guidelines addressing issues of double taxation and non-taxation that may arise from inconsistent application of GST in international trade ​The OECD work on VAT/GST is part of the broader “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS) programme. For services and intangibles, the issue of which country has the right to tax arises. The taxing rights for goods is clear: it is the country of import that has the right to tax. ​Sometimes it is not clear where a service is consumed and therefore which country should impose tax (see the example over the page). Without international consensus on taxing rights, it is possible that services could be taxed in two or more countries or not at all. ​Draft OECD guidelines broadly divide cross-border services into “remote” services and “on-the-spot” services, with different treatment for each. 6 | Double taxation and non-taxation ​A consumer is a resident in Country Y and visits Country X for a holiday. While there he downloads software onto his phone. ​Depending on the GST rules of Country X and Country Y, the customer could be taxed in Country X, Country Y, neither or both. Software Co Country X Country Y $10 (plus?) Holiday 7 | OECD recommended option ​OECD recommended option ​The OECD has suggested that, when a remote service is supplied to a person, the supplier of the service (Software Co in the example below) could be required to register and return GST in the country where the person is resident. Country X New Zealand Software Co (registered for New Zealand GST) $11.50 (incl NZ GST) Inland Revenue $1.50 8 | Proposed system for New Zealand ​This document suggests that New Zealand adopt a model for cross-border services and intangibles that is consistent with OECD guidelines. ​This would require non-resident providers of remote services to New Zealand tax residents to register for New Zealand GST and return GST on those sales. ​These proposals broadly match legislation that already operates in the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland and South Africa. Similar rules have also been proposed in Australia and Japan. ​Details of how this system might operate are discussed on the following pages. ​It is anticipated that the GST treatment of low-value imported goods will be consulted on separately in the near future. Imported low-value goods 10 | Low-value goods ​Despite the goods having the same underlying value, the customer is required to pay GST on the imported shoes, but not the car stereo. ​De minimis threshold ​GST on imported goods is either collected at the border by Customs or on their behalf by courier companies, unless the total duty value (which includes GST, tariffs and other duties) is less than $60. This is known as the de minimis threshold. ​New Zealand is required to have a de minimis threshold. It is set at a level where the costs of collection exceed the revenue collected. \*Where there is not a contract to sell (for example a gift) the date of disposal would be determined according to ordinary rules. Car Stereo Co Shoes Co ​Example ​A New Zealand consumer buys a car stereo and a pair of shoes online. Both cost NZ$250 and have a NZ$50 postage charge. The stereo attracts no tariff, but the shoes attract a 10% tariff. Country X New Zealand Duty: $300 x 15% GST = $45 (under de minimis, no duty to pay) Duty: ($300 + $25 tariff x 15% = $73.75 (over de minimis, duty to pay) 11 | Lowering the de minimis and other collection options ​Customs review ​Customs has been asked to look at the options for simplifying GST collection and changing the level of the de minimis. They will report to Cabinet with options by October this year and it is anticipated that this will be followed by public consultation on the issue. ​Potential future changes ​It is currently the Government’s intention to align, where possible, the collection of GST on imported goods with the proposals in the paper relating to the collection of cross-border services and intangibles. ​However, no other country has adopted such a system and, therefore, the success of its application to goods is currently uncertain. ​Issues to be resolved ​Further work is required to determine the viability of options and whether they would in fact lower costs of collection. ​It is likely that a combination of approaches would be required. Place of supply rules 13 | On-the-spot services ​On-the-spot services These are services that are performed at a certain location and consumed at the same time and place they are physically performed. Examples are: •A hair cut •Accommodation •A restaurant meal •Entry to a cinema, museum, sports event etc. ​Who taxes these services? These are services that should be taxed in the country where they are received. The current GST rules already provide this result, so it is not proposed that they change. This means that on-the-spot services received offshore will remain outside the GST net altogether. Example A New Zealander on holiday in Australia pays for and visits a theme park. Australia has the right to tax that service and New Zealand does not. 14 | Remote services ​Remote services ​These are services where the customer and supplier are not generally required to be in the same location and so are generally not consumed at the place they are performed. Examples are: •Online supply of software •Online supply of digital content (movies TV shows, music etc.) •Consultancy, accountancy and legal services •Financial and insurance services ​Who taxes these services? These are services that should be taxed in the country where the consumer is resident. This means that residence is treated as a proxy for consumption. An example of what this means in practice follows. 15 | Residence as a proxy: example Country X New Zealand Software Co New Zealand resident on holiday in Country X Country X resident on holiday in New Zealand $10 (plus any GST charged by Country X) $11.50 (incl New Zealand GST) Services covered 17 | Definition of “services” Broad definition of services In New Zealand’s GST Act, “services” is broadly defined to include anything other than physical goods and money. It is proposed that this definition be retained so that any new rules would cover all “remote” services (as mentioned earlier, this includes digital as well as traditional services such as legal advice). Although some countries have limited their version of these rules to digital services only, there is a risk that such restrictions could: •Create customer biases between digital and non-digital services. •Make the rules unnecessarily complex, as suppliers would be required to work out whether a service was “digital” and therefore subject to GST. 18 | Supplies to GST-registered businesses ​The options ​It is suggested that GST always apply to “business-to-consumer” supplies. However, there are two options for supplies by non- residents to GST-registered New Zealand businesses. ​ Include business supplies in the rules ​ Exclude business supplies from the rules ​In both examples, the net revenue collected from the transactions is the same. This is because the GST-registered business can normally claim back any GST charged. Therefore, it comes down to assessing the relative compliance costs on New Zealand and non-resident businesses and the revenue risks associated with each option. Software Co Software Co Importer Ltd, a GST-registered business Importer Ltd, a GST-registered business Inland Revenue $11.50 (incl New Zealand GST) $11.50 (incl New Zealand GST) $1.50 input claim/refund $11.50 (incl New Zealand GST) $10 (no New Zealand GST payable) Who should register? 20 | Electronic marketplaces ​When would the marketplace register? ​It is proposed that an electronic marketplace would be required to be registered when the customers would normally consider the marketplace to be the supplier and this is reflected in the contractual arrangements. This could be when the marketplace: •Authorises the charge to the customer •Authorises delivery to the customer •Sets the terms and conditions of the transaction It is not suggested that these rules would require a payment service provider to register. ​Registration by marketplaces ​Non-resident suppliers can use electronic marketplaces to sell their services and intangibles to New Zealand consumers. ​It is proposed that the marketplace be treated as the supplier and therefore be required to register. 21 | Registration threshold ​Domestic threshold... ​The domestic registration threshold is $60k. ​Applying this to non-resident sellers has the advantage of consistency, but: New Zealand is likely to be only a small part of their international market. Non-residents may be able to “fracture” their business into parts to come under the threshold. Non-residents under the threshold may be registered in their home country so could claim input tax there. ​... or something lower? ​A lower threshold would be in line with international norms. Countries with similar rules have low or (in the case of the European Union) nil thresholds. ​A lower threshold could address concerns with applying the domestic threshold. ​BUT, it could increase compliance costs on small/medium businesses selling into New Zealand. Identifying New Zealand customers 23 | Identifying New Zealand resident customers ​Option 1: Take reasonable steps Rules could require the non-resident business to: •Take reasonable steps to obtain information on the customer’s residence. •Charge GST unless they are satisfied that the customer is not a New Zealand resident. ​Option 2: Use proxies As part of the transaction, the seller will likely collect information on the customer, such as: •Billing/home address •IP address •Bank details •Location of originating payment •For some services, the location of the customer’s fixed landline In Europe, the supplier can rely on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence to determine a customer’s residence. ​Two options ​Again, there are two main options for determining whether a customer is a New Zealand resident. ​Suggested approach There is a trade-off between accuracy (taking reasonable steps) and simplicity (using proxies). Option 2 maybe preferable because of its lower compliance costs to businesses, however: •The rules should focus on proxies that are least susceptible to error. •The supplier should not be able to rely on less accurate proxies if better information can be relatively easily obtained. 24 | Identifying New Zealand businesses ​Nature of supply In many cases, due to the nature of the supplies, an offshore supplier will be able to assume that the services will be received by an unregistered individual. In these cases, GST will be charged. ​When it’s not clear A New Zealand customer may provide their IRD number to an offshore supplier as evidence that they are GST-registered. An offshore supplier should be able to rely on the IRD number of the business and not charge GST. ​This is only relevant if it is decided that supplies to GST-registered businesses should not be subject to the proposed rules ​Incorrect representation If an unregistered person represents that they are a GST-registered business, it is proposed that: •The existing tax knowledge offence provisions apply, with fines of up to $25k for a first offence and $50k for subsequent offences. •In more egregious cases, Inland Revenue should be able to register the customer and require them to account for the GST . The non-resident business will be required to retain the IRD numbers provided. Enforcement 26 | Enforcement for non-resident suppliers ​International assistance The OECD envisages international mechanisms helping with enforcement, including: •The Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters, to which New Zealand is a signatory. •New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements, which normally include information-sharing provisions that cover GST. •Future agreements with other jurisdictions. ​Self-assessment with penalties for non-compliance New Zealand’s tax system works on a self-assessment basis, with the assumption that most people do the right thing. The normal enforcement rules and penalties would apply, including: •Inland Revenue has the ability to require a supplier to register and return GST. •Statutory penalties and interest obligations apply for non- payment. Registration and filing 28 | Registration and filing periods ​Filing periods ​It is suggested that non-residents required to register under the proposed rules should be on a fixed two-monthly filing period (New Zealand's normal filing period). ​Registration Three registration options are being considered: •Requiring non-residents to use the domestic registration system. •Having a special “pay-only’ system for non- residents that are only required to return GST, but do not incur New Zealand expenses. •A regional “one-stop-shop”. This system operates in Europe and means that a non- resident only registers and returns GST in one country. The country of registration then distributes their share of the GST to other members. This option would require international cooperation, for example with Australia.
Hon Todd McClay MINISTER OF REVENUE Hon Bill English MINISTER OF FINANCE MAKING TAX SIMPLER A GOVERNMENT GREEN PAPER ON TAX ADMINISTRATION The first in a series of government discussion documents looking towards a better tax administration system for New Zealanders First published in March 2015 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration ISBN 978-0-478-42408-9 New Zealand has a very good tax and social policy delivery system. Taxes are required to finance the government services that New Zealanders expect. They are an important part of a good and inclusive society. At the same time they impose costs which should be kept to a minimum. It is also important that taxes are fair and seen to be fair. New Zealand came through the recession in good shape and the strength of the tax system played an important part in that. We need to ensure that we continue to be well placed to weather any future economic storms on the domestic or international fronts. Our tax system works on the principle of voluntary compliance, and the vast majority of people do the right thing and comply with their tax obligations. That’s largely because our tax system is reasonably fair and coherent. A good tax system is good tax policy supported by good administration of tax laws. New Zealand is served well by its broad-based, low-rate tax settings. Our broad bases help make our tax system less distorting. Our relatively simple and coherent tax system also helps keep costs to taxpayers in complying with the tax system and costs to the government in administering the tax system, relatively low. But the tax administration system reflects incremental decisions that have been made over many years. We can and must do better. We want to cut the costs to taxpayers of complying with the tax system and to the government of administering the tax system without making things more distorting. Some people are unsure about how best to comply with the tax system and we want to make it easier for them. We want businesses to be able to focus on running their businesses with tax as a secondary consideration. We want it to be more difficult for people to fall into overdue debt and easier for them to manage their tax payments. We want people and resources at Inland Revenue to be focused on outcomes rather than low- FOREWORD FROM THE MINISTERS all benefit from its smooth running so it’s important that we all consider for ourselves what kind of tax administration we want. We want your views on whether the ideas outlined in this Green paper are heading in the right direction and that we are focused on the right things, before more work is done. It’s important for all New Zealanders to have their say because this is an opportunity to help set the priorities for change, and shape the way we administer the tax system. Over the next few years, you’ll see detailed proposals about different aspects of tax administration. The programme of work is very ambitious. We look forward to receiving your views. value tasks. We want to boost overall levels of compliance so everyone is paying their fair share of tax. Tax obligations should be easy to comply with and hard to get wrong. Greater use of electronic and internet-based technology is a key enabler to achieve these objectives. Achieving high levels of compliance will be of greater and greater importance in the future as New Zealand’s population ages. In making these changes, we will have to manage very carefully the cumulative impact on businesses and other customers. This Green paper sets out the Government’s initial thinking about a possible future for our tax administration. We want your thoughts because it’s your tax system too. Inland Revenue is the government department that New Zealanders deal with most often, not just on tax matters, but for a range of other services as well. Inland Revenue has responsibility for administering Child Support, Student Loan repayments, Working for Families and KiwiSaver. Furthermore a number of other agencies, such as ACC and MSD, use tax-related information to deliver their services. Whether the tax system benefits you indirectly through taxpayer-funded services or through its contribution to the economy, or you benefit directly through social policies such as Working for Families, today’s tax system is a part of all of our lives.

The world is changing, with huge improvements in ways of doing business. What was acceptable 10 or 20 years ago no longer meets the demands of customers today. Inland Revenue not only collects revenue but also administers a number of social policy programmes. The tax system is important for New Zealand. It helps fund a wide range of government functions such as healthcare, welfare, education, infrastructure, police, border control, emergency response, and many other services. To protect the Government’s ability to keep providing these services, it is important that our tax system keeps pace with change. The tax system should be simple and make it easy for people to get right, but difficult to get wrong. It should be fair and support high levels of overall compliance. Improvements should ensure that businesses spend less time on tax and more time on running their business, supporting Government’s wider goal to build a more competitive and productive economy. Costs to customers of complying and to the Government of administering the tax system, should be kept to a minimum. This document aims to introduce you to the broad direction the Government intends to take to improve the administration of the tax system. Your views on that direction are important. The ideas in this Green paper are in the early stages of development and will be subject to more detailed consultation in the coming years. WHAT CUSTOMERS THINK In June 2014, in conjunction with the Treasury and Victoria University, Inland Revenue hosted a conference entitled, Tax Administration for the 21 st century. The conference’s purpose was to explore options for making tax easier (by reducing both compliance and administration costs) and increasing voluntary compliance balanced against core tax policy objectives such as raising revenue, and ensuring fairness and efficiency. AT A GLANCE 8 The main points made by attendees at the conference were: • giving people the ability to self- manage their tax affairs with more speed and predictability but with access to the right staff at the right time with the necessary skills to provide certainty to taxpayers. In other words, Inland Revenue should use new technology to allow more focus on high-value services to taxpayers, to help them manage their tax affairs; • the need to consider policy and legislative settings (and not merely current business processes) to rethink how tax administration can be improved. It is more than just digitising existing processes and replacing an aging information technology system. Anything within the tax administration system should be up for consideration; • the importance of involving businesses, other customers, third parties and advisors in the design of the rules and processes that underpin tax administration. The tax administration system has to work for all New Zealanders; • the cost of change needs to be closely considered and managed to ensure that it is not merely shifting costs from Inland Revenue to businesses and other customers or vice versa. There has to be an overall net benefit to society through a real reduction of compliance and administrative costs; and • ensuring that there is continued maintenance of the tax system while modernising tax administration; RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK After reviewing feedback, the Government is proposing to modernise the way Inland Revenue administers the tax system over a period of years, with particular focus on making better use of digital services for transactions with Inland Revenue. Over the coming years the main emphasis will likely be on the improvements set out on the next page. 9 Individuals by • providing online income tax statements already filled out with your income details (pre- populating) so for the majority all that would be required would be to check and confirm income details, or correct them; and • more effective use of technology to better manage both overpayments (refunds) and underpayments (debts) of tax. What it could mean for individuals • You would be able to quickly and easily manage your tax obligations online. • Refunds would be made quickly and automatically based on better use of data. • Any outstanding tax debts would be recovered automatically over time, where appropriate. Find out more on page 32 Employers and businesses by • streamlining the collection of PAYE and GST and other withholding taxes such as resident withholding tax and related information to integrate these obligations into business processes; • investigating options for simplifying the calculation of provisional tax; • helping smaller businesses get their tax affairs and systems correct, right from the start; and • Inland Revenue being able to focus more resources on high- value tasks, such as providing faster and more predictable views on the application of tax laws. What it could mean for employers and businesses • Tax compliance costs would be reduced, in particular for small and medium enterprises. • Speed and predictability for businesses in their tax affairs, making compliance easier. • Making tax obligations part of the normal day-to-day business processes, making it harder to get things wrong. • Simplified calculations for provisional tax – based more on real-time information (for example, when using approved accounting software) – together with payment options that better reflect taxpayers’ cash flows. Find out more on pages 21 to 29 Social policy customers by • designing processes that work for the customer and are fit for purpose; • using pre-populated information that Inland Revenue or government already holds; and • providing for timely payments on a more real-time basis, resulting in certainty for individuals and families. What it could mean for you • Faster, more accurate information. • Less chance of going into debt. • Correct entitlements, reflecting your changing circumstances.

This includes a responsibility to all New Zealanders to be efficient in collecting taxes and paying entitlements. Inland Revenue must deliver on government priorities. It should be a world-class revenue organisation, recognised for service and excellence. This means it must: • be agile, effective and efficient (for example, by reducing compliance and administration costs); • enable taxpayers, wherever possible, to self-manage with speed and certainty; 1 • enable the Government to make timely and cost-effective policy changes; and • work with other government agencies to more efficiently deliver services. New Zealand’s tax system Having a good overall tax system means having both good tax policies and good administrative systems. These elements need to go hand in hand. The tax system includes social policies administered by Inland Revenue; Working for Families, Child Support, Student Loan repayments, KiwiSaver and Paid Parental Leave. The tax system should ensure that it is easy for customers to comply with their obligations. The ease with which customers can comply has an effect on overall compliance and, together with the perception of fairness, is a crucial factor in assessing the overall effectiveness of a tax system. New Zealand’s tax policies The aim of New Zealand’s tax policies is to tax as broad a range of income and expenditure as practicable at rates that are as low as possible. Known as the broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) approach, this provides stable revenue and promotes efficiency, equity and fairness. It helps support economic efficiency and growth. It also helps keep administration and compliance costs low. It is a much more coherent way of levying tax than in most OECD countries.

It highlights New Zealand’s focus on just three main tax bases (personal income tax, company tax and GST). All of these have broad coverage, allowing substantial amounts of tax to be collected at relatively modest tax rates, while avoiding the inefficient taxes found in many other countries. Endorsement of New Zealand’s tax policies New Zealand’s tax policies work well and are held in high regard internationally.2 A number of independent domestic reviews of the tax system have also been undertaken in recent years, and have fundamentally supported New Zealand's underlying tax system and BBLR framework.3 A high burden of proof is needed for any reforms which move away from BBLR principles. Future challenges There are long-term future fiscal pressures that future Governments will need to consider. An ageing population coupled with the increasing demand for world class healthcare and other services, will contribute to these pressures. We should do everything possible to ensure high levels of compliance to manage these fiscal pressures. Boosting levels of compliance is an important part of modernising the tax administration. MODERNISING OUR TAX ADMINISTRATION The way our tax administration currently runs reflects a series of changes that have been made over the years. Each change has been sensible but not necessarily in relation to the overall coherence of the system. The Government has not, until now, stood back and had a fundamental look at how tax might best be administered if it were starting from scratch. Problems with the current system include: • Compliance and administration costs are too high. • Some people find it difficult to fully comply. • There is a lack of flexibility in accommodating future policy changes. • Stakeholders have commented on a lack of speed and certainty (for example, taxpayer rulings and rectifying defects in legislation). • There are difficulties for customers and advisors in accessing the right information at the right time. • There are concerns about customers falling into debt and the difficulties they face in emerging from debt. 16 • The Government wants to see Inland Revenue providing better value for money. This is not just a matter of reducing administration costs but also ensuring that resources are focused on the highest value tasks. • Information is often not provided in a way that represents value for money. This makes it difficult to identify key policy concerns and audit risks. • While most customers voluntarily comply with the tax system, there are some that do not and it is important to continue to improve levels of overall compliance. • Those who knowingly or unknowingly fail to comply or who otherwise “game the tax system” because of the ability to claim refunds without always paying outstanding tax, can create an unfairness in the tax system. The Government's proposed modernisation and simplification of tax administration is far more than just updating a computer system. Rather, it is a chance to have a fundamental look at tax administration in New Zealand and see what changes need to be undertaken to meet the challenges of the 21 st century. This includes re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with customers, and looking at possible changes to legislation including the Tax Administration Act 1994. This has wider implications beyond Inland Revenue. The information Inland Revenue collects is already critical to the delivery of services by other agencies such as ACC. Consistent with Government’s drive for better public services, information sharing between government agencies is expected to increase to deliver more efficient outcomes for New Zealanders.4 It is therefore vital to establish the sort of tax administration services that promote high levels of compliance and deliver the benefits that taxpayers, their advisors, and users of social policy services actually want and need. Key benefits The potential changes discussed in this Green paper, when taken as a whole, should help to make the tax administration more customer- focussed. It should be easier for people to see their overall position, and to meet their tax and social policy obligations with greater speed and accuracy. Predictability for customers should be increased by: • providing easy digital access to customers’ accounts (and alternatives for those without such access); • providing earlier and simpler transactions and responding to customers’ issues quickly and effectively; 17 for customers for the Government for both customers and government FUTURE TAX SYSTEM EASIERFASTER HARDER TO GET INTO DEBT, EASIER TO GET OUT MORE PREDICTABLE EMBEDDING TAX IN EXISTING BUSINESS SYSTEMS LOWER COST TO ENGAGE WITH CHEAPER FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RUN SUPPORT ALL-OF- GOVERNMENT GOALS FLEXIBILITY – CAN CHANGE TO MEET FUTURE NEEDS BENEFITS OF A FUTURE TAX SYSTEM 18 • using a business’s normal business processes and systems to meet tax obligations; and • improving the collection, accuracy and timeliness of information to simplify and better tailor interactions. It should be easier and less expensive for people to get it right and meet their obligations (and harder for them to get it wrong). It should be harder for people to fall into debt in the first place, and also easier for them to correct if they do. Compliance and administration costs should be reduced. It should help ensure the on-going surety and integrity of the tax and social policy system. A more effective tax administration would support broader 'all-of- government' goals and provide value for money for the Government. It would provide sufficient information so that key policy concerns and audit risks can be identified easily. A more effective tax administration would also provide flexibility to cater for future policy changes. In short, Inland Revenue’s processes and systems should be simple, and make it easy to get things right and hard to get things wrong, be quick and low-effort to use, provide more certainty, and should not require duplication of effort by customers or associated third parties. They should also be flexible enough to move with technology developments. This will not be an easy shift to make, or a quick one, but it is absolutely necessar y. If you would like to read more about policy considerations that frame New Zealand's tax administration, go to Appendix 1. WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK The Government recognises that many of the opportunities for improvement will be best known by customers, third parties, advisors and the wider business community. To that end, issuing this Green paper formally establishes the start of the consultation process on how to undertake the process of transforming New Zealand’s tax administration services. The Government invites submissions on whether the potential changes discussed in this Green paper would likely achieve the intended benefits for businesses and other customers. The ideas in this Green paper are in the early stages of development, and will be subject to their own consultation processes over the coming years. However, even at this early stage, the Government is keen to get your feedback to test whether the general direction and indicative timing of any potential changes outlined in this Green paper are valid or not, and to identify any errors or omissions of scope. 19 The Government recognises the cumulative impact on business and other customers resulting from possible changes discussed in this Green paper. This process will need to be managed to ensure businesses and other customers are not faced with multiple changes occurring throughout the implementation of different streams of work. This is to minimise the one-off compliance cost impact of changing business systems to accommodate changes. KEY QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 Would the potential changes discussed in this Green paper be broad enough to deliver significant improvements to New Zealand’s tax administration systems? 2 Are the potential changes heading in the right direction, and have we focused on the right issues? 3 Are there any errors or key omissions? If so, what are they? 4 Is the proposed sequencing and order of the work sensible? 5 Does the current sequencing and order of work ensure the compliance costs associated with implementing change are minimised for business and other customers? 1 Certainty is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as “the quality of being reliably true” or “a general air of confidence”. In the context of this Green paper, the use of the word ‘certainty’ is not intended to convey any reference to legislative certainty in the context of the statutory time bar, rather it is to be used in its more general meaning. 2 See, for example: - Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report (http://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/ Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-ap-2014-tax-complexity-survey.pdf) - Washington DC Tax Foundation’s 2014 international tax competitiveness index (see http://taxfoundation.org/article/2014-international-tax- competitiveness-index) 3 For example the McLeod Review in 2001 and, more recently, the Tax Working Group in 2010 4 Such as through Result Area 9; New Zealand businesses have a one stop online shop for all government advice and support to run and grow their business. The Better Business Programme is a recognition that the public sector needs to take a more joined-up approach to achieve better outcomes for business customers and individuals. 20 The diagram below shows the key elements of the modernisation programme. These elements are discussed in greater detail in the appendices attached to this Green paper, but the following provides a brief summary. PAYE AND GST e.g. Streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information – integrate tax obligations into business process OTHER WITHHOLDING TAX REGIMES SUCH AS RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TA X e.g. Streamline the collection of other withholding tax information – integrating tax obligations into business processes INDIVIDUALS' TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. More pre-population of income details resulting from improved collection of withholding tax information BUSINESS TAX OBLIGATIONS e.g. Review and streamline the collection of business taxes such as provisional tax – integrating tax obligations into business processes SOCIAL POLICY e.g. Review and streamline the delivery of social assistance products such as Working for Families tax credits TAX T YPE RATIONALISATION where appropriate DIGITAL SERVICES REVIEW BROADER TAX ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY SETTINGS TO FRAME AND SUPPORT THE BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME TIME CHAPTER 2 KEY ELEMENTS OF POTENTIAL CHANGES 21 THE FUTURE FOR BUSINESS PROCESSES – PAYE Taxes deducted from salary and wage earners by their employers form a very important part of our tax administration, so streamlining the collection of PAYE, GST and related information, and integrating tax obligations into business processes, is crucial for modernising the tax system. Pay As You Earn (PAYE) is a system for deducting income tax at source for salary and wages, and all who employ staff use the PAYE system. Every month, employers (or PAYE intermediaries) send PAYE information to Inland Revenue using the Employer Monthly Schedule (EMS). This process is a crucial part of the administration so the Government wants it to operate as smoothly as possible with minimum compliance costs for employers. Integrating the collection of this information into normal business processes would be an important first step to reduce the compliance costs for businesses. In doing so, providing PAYE information then becomes part of a wider process rather than an additional step required by the tax system. Crucially, comprehensive collection of accurate PAYE information is also a pre-requisite to enable Inland Revenue to provide accurate tax information for individuals on an online income statement (see page 32 for more information on this). In its current form, the EMS has many positive attributes, but it is still largely paper based. Even when electronic filing is used or required, submitting returns is an additional process and not aligned to businesses’ accounting or payroll processes. This results in businesses spending extra time inputting data and increases the risk of errors. Potential benefits from improving the way the EMS operates for employers, intermediaries and Inland Revenue include: • avoiding unnecessary duplication by integrating PAYE into existing business systems (for example, the payroll system) rather than a stand-alone system and process; • allowing business systems to talk directly to Inland Revenue systems, and vice versa; • easy amendment and correction of tax codes; • ensuring the information provided is validated immediately; and • up-front verification of information (i.e. tax codes) to allow the EMS to be better used to collect underpayments of tax. Focussing on the transfer of data, rather than on the current prescriptive filing of EMS returns, means information can potentially be provided and corrected at any time during a period, rather than just at the end of a prescribed period. This will ensure that what is withheld or ACCOUNTING SOFT WARE QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 The Government’s view is that more effective use of a business’s own systems to provide PAYE, GST and related information to Inland Revenue would provide real benefits to employers – do you agree? 2 If not, what would be a better focus for future consideration in relation to PAYE processes? 3 Have we considered all likely issues in relation to streamlining the collection of PAYE and related information? 22 paid during the year more accurately reflects the customer’s actual obligation or entitlement. It should also provide additional flexibility for taxpayers. In order to improve and streamline the collection of PAYE information, the following issues will need to be carefully considered. • Should the current EMS form be replaced with automatic digital data transfers? • How should Inland Revenue ideally obtain additional relevant information? • When will the information be considered accurate? • Should some employee information be private and not shared with an employer (for example, should child support information be treated differently as it is a matter between the employee and Inland Revenue)? • Should the timing of PAYE information and payment of PAYE align to when salaries and wages are paid to employees? Innovation by software developers and payroll providers will be an important ingredient in ensuring that any PAYE changes are successful. In particular this should help ensure that “normal” business processes are used wherever possible. Such changes will not just be confined to the provision of PAYE information – the same issues and principles will also apply to other requirements. For example, the ability to use a business’s own systems should equally apply to GST information requirements. If you would like to read more about streamlining the collection of PAYE and GST go to Appendix 2. But it is not just about streamlining PAYE processes... It is also timely to look at the PAYE rules more generally to ensure that they work as efficiently as possible. A review of these rules will focus on removing undue complexity and providing more clarity in their application. The rules have not been fundamentally reviewed since their introduction in 1957. This review of tax administration provides the opportunity to investigate whether improvements can be made to ensure the rules reflect modern employment practices. A review of the PAYE rules should focus on removing complexity to ensure employers can apply the rules with the least amount of effort resulting in a reduction in compliance costs. There are a number of factors influencing the accuracy of the amount of PAYE deducted. These include use of the correct tax code, assistance by Inland Revenue in helping to identify incorrect tax codes and calculation accuracy (for both payroll packages and manual CROSS-BORDER EMPLOYMENT ONE-OFF PAYM E N T S? LIMIT TO ADDITIONAL DEDUCTIONS? SECONDARY TAX CODES? E X T R A PAYS? H O LI DAY PAY ? REVIEW OF PAYE FRINGE BENEFITS, SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS & SHARE SCHEMES 23 calculations), and other changes in employee information. A review of the existing PAYE rules will focus on: • Rationalisation of how employment remuneration is taxed and whether all forms of remuneration can be included under PAYE. For example, can some or all of fringe benefits, employer superannuation contributions and employee share schemes income be incorporated into the PAYE rules? • Whether one-off payments can be included in the PAYE rules to avoid taxpayers becoming provisional taxpayers. • How the PAYE rules apply to cross- border employment relationships. • Wage protection for example, ensuring employees receive a sufficient minimum net payment when exploring whether the PAYE system should be used to recover outstanding liabilities. • Extra pays, due to the complexity of the current calculation. • Clarifying the taxation of holiday pay. • Simplifying the application of secondary tax codes due to better income information being received during the year. • Opportunities for common definitions of salary and wages to be used for a range of taxes and social policy products, thereby simplifiying the rules and reducing complexity. If you would like to read more about reviewing the PAYE rules go to Appendix 2. Enhancing withholding taxes to cover ‘employment-like’ income Withholding taxes like PAYE are widely considered to be the foundation of an effective tax administration. Such a system requires third parties (for example, employers, financial institutions etc.) to withhold an amount of tax from payments of income. The existing PAYE model works well for the withholding of employment income where the traditional employee-employer relationship exists. For those who earn their income outside of a true employer- employee relationship, such as the self-employed or independent contractors, the picture is less straightforward. The current rules only require the payer to withhold tax for payments made to contractors who are in a listed set of industries. For contractors involved in those industries not listed, however, withholding does not currently take place. The current contractor withholding rules were introduced in 1957, at the same time as PAYE. The labour market has changed since 1957. The rules have only ever been extended QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4 Are we considering all the relevant issues with the application of the current PAYE rules? 5 Are there any other concerns facing employers that would improve how the PAYE rules work? 24 in an ad hoc way, for example, adding or removing specific industries. A review is needed to develop a more comprehensive and consistent withholding regime to keep up with modern work practices. Business transformation provides the opportunity to consider whether there are ways to improve and simplify taxpayers’ interactions with Inland Revenue when the traditional employer-employee relationship does not exist. A review would consider whether withholding at source could be used in a wider range of situations, including independent contractors, and possibly for particular industries. Enhancing the withholding regime also provides for the ability to improve compliance from particular participants in the labour market, for example, from migrant workers. The main objective is the provision of timely information and tax payments from business which are accurate, comprehensive and error free. Information should also be able to be shared with other government agencies where it is appropriate to do so. Solutions in this area would ideally reduce compliance and administration costs for businesses and Government as a whole, while at the same time increasing compliance levels from all customers. Ideally there would be other benefits as well, such as reducing the possibility of customers falling into debt. In practice there are likely to be trade-offs. An important consideration is to ensure that any change does not just merely shift the cost of compliance from Inland Revenue to business. The Government may, where it has concerns with voluntary compliance, look to address the scope of the PAYE and the schedular payment rules. If you would like to read more about possible changes to the withholding regime go to Appendix 2. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 6 What factors should Government be particularly conscious of when considering changes to the withholding tax regime in order to cover more employment-like situations? 25 THE FUTURE FOR BUSINESS TAX It is vitally important for the Government to understand what, from a business tax perspective, the fundamental issues are in order to make improvements. The tax system needs to focus on speed, accuracy, certainty, predictability and low business risk in business taxation matters. Businesses have stated that speed and certainty, and issues with provisional tax are important concerns. Businesses want access to the right people at the right time at Inland Revenue to ensure they are doing the right thing. But are there aspects of running a business that present specific issues – such as the impact of taking on more staff? The tax system should be easy for businesses to comply with, ensuring they spend more time on running their businesses and less time on tax. If it is easy to do the right thing, overall levels of compliance will increase. As mentioned above, the provisional tax rules are an important consideration for businesses as they are the mechanism by which most businesses pay tax during the year. The following discussion provides some initial high-level ideas to improve the calculation and payment of provisional tax. Provisional tax Businesses are required to pay income tax on their profits. The exact amount of tax that a business is required to pay for each year can only be determined after that year has finished. The current provisional tax rules, however, are designed to ensure that tax is paid during the year, rather than at the end of the year. The calculation and payment of provisional and terminal tax currently presents some problems for businesses of various sizes, including: • use-of-money interest (UOMI) risk for businesses, resulting from the need to estimate annual tax liabilities part-way through a year of assessment for provisional tax purposes; • the compliance costs associated with estimating liabilities before the year of assessment has ended; and • the one-off square-up nature of terminal tax can present cash flow difficulties for businesses, in particular, because of the nature of the current rules for new businesses. This also has flow-on effects for Inland Revenue in its enforcement activities. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 7 What are the key tax administration issues currently facing businesses? Are there any particular areas that present concrete ways of increasing speed and certainty? 8 How important is improving the provisional tax rules in reducing compliance costs for business? Are there other more important issues the Government should be focusing on instead, or as well? 9 The Government seeks feedback on more effective and simple methods of calculating and paying provisional tax and, in particular, how provisional tax could be better aligned to other business processes. 26 PROVISIONAL TAX USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST RISK CASHFLOW DIFFICULTIES COMPLIANCE COSTS OF ESTIMATING PROVISIONAL TAX ISSUES 27 Any design improvements to the provisional tax rules would need to consider the following: • the impact on how businesses generate their cashflows; • the use, as much as possible, of existing business processes and technology; • encouraging compliance by making it easy to comply and hard not to; • the reduction of compliance costs; • the impact of UOMI on underpayments on businesses; • equity between different taxpayers; and • maintaining fiscal stability and predictability for the Government. The calculation and payment of business income tax could be done more “on-account” as income is earned during the year – much like a PAYE system for businesses. One idea is by considering whether accounting profits with a few key adjustments (for example, reversing out capital gains and losses and excluding non-taxable income) could effectively be used as a better proxy for a business’s end- of-year tax obligation. This has the potential to simplify the calculation of provisional tax and create more certainty for taxpayers and reflect cashflow. Alternatively, a simplified system whereby provisional tax payments are based on another proxy (for example a bespoke percentage of a business’s turnover) could also be investigated. Any review of the provisional tax rules would also have to consider changes to the standard uplift method of calculating provisional tax, together with the current safe harbour limits and use of money interest rules. A review of the tax pooling rules should also be undertaken to see if they can be improved and/or made available to more taxpayers. If you would like to read more about the future for business tax go to Appendix 3. Small businesses A particular focus of modernising the tax administration system is to ensure it becomes easier for small businesses to comply with their tax obligations, thereby reducing their compliance costs and improving overall levels of compliance. Many small businesses have difficulty in meeting their tax obligations. Compliance costs are also higher for smaller businesses compared with larger businesses which tend to have better tax understanding, better financial systems and better business processes. Therefore, it is important that Inland Revenue is more proactive and sophisticated in its approach to providing assistance to these businesses. 28 Taxes should not be a minefield for small businesses – complying should be easy. It may be that there is assistance that Inland Revenue could provide to specifically help small businesses, including encouraging the use of improved business systems and accounting software that meets specific standards to ensure the first few years of a business’s life-cycle are successful. Other forms of assistance could involve ensuring that the right support is available at key events that may result in tax obligations, such as taking on new staff for the first time. Ensuring that businesses get it right first time and maintaining that will be a real focus. This is likely to be a more productive use of both business and Inland Revenue staff time than lower- value activities, such as keying in data from paper forms. Software would have the ability to help users correctly classify transactions to ensure tax obligations are correctly met right from the start. Taxpayers who use the software would benefit from greater certainty as errors and misclassification would be reduced. A move in this direction could be supported by changes to the penalties regime. The current penalties regime is based on associated shortfalls arising from individual transactions. Where appropriate, the penalties regime could be adjusted to instead focus more on recognising that the taxpayer is attempting to comply. Inland Revenue could provide the support necessary to encourage taxpayers to remedy systems faults which give rise to tax shortfalls. Adopting business systems and accounting software that meets specific standards would be a key component of this. Small business may also benefit from tax rules being 'simplified'. By ‘simplified’ the Government does not mean introducing tax concessions for small businesses. Tax breaks for a particular group or industry are likely to create distortions by encouraging resources to flow into less productive activities, solely to get the tax break. This is inconsistent with the BBLR framework discussed in chapter 1. However, it may be possible to make some changes that result in tax simplification for small businesses that reduce compliance costs and make it easy to comply without a substantial fiscal impact. If you would like to read more about proposed improvements for small businesses go to Appendix 3. Information provision In a digital world, providing paper tax returns is an out-dated concept. Taxpayers are often forced to duplicate processes in order to comply with current information requirements. The information required may also be out of sync with the business’s size or risk profile. From Inland Revenue’s perspective, it may not be receiving from businesses the type of information that would QUESTIONS FOR READERS 10 Is the proposed direction outlined here the correct focus to provide benefits for small businesses or are there other more important ways of helping small businesses? 11 Are there any areas where you think tax for small businesses can be simplified, without creating specific tax breaks? 12 A particular focus is to ensure that small businesses achieve higher levels of compliance – what are the most important practical ways of promoting and achieving higher levels of compliance? 29 most effectively allow it to carry out its debt recovery, audit and other core functions. There is also an efficiency cost to taxpayers and Inland Revenue in processing non-digital and/or superfluous information. New technology provides an opportunity to rationalise current tax returns for businesses. The focus in the future should be on providing relevant and timely information efficiently. This will therefore form the basis of a review of information requirements facing businesses. If you would like to read more about business income information provisions go to Appendix 3. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 13 What are the key considerations that should be taken into account when looking at the provision of business income information? 30 Income earned from savings and investments is likely to grow in the future, as the population ages and more capital is accumulated. It is therefore important to ensure that such sources of income, and associated resident withholding tax (RWT) deducted at source, are accurately and promptly recorded. A review of the current RWT rules should build on improvements arising from more effective and streamlined collection of PAYE information. Any improvements in this area will also help facilitate changes to how Inland Revenue interacts with individuals and businesses. A particular focus is how to enhance the provision of information about RWT on interest and dividends by integration into existing business processes – similar to the process envisaged for an improved PAYE information-gathering process. This information should be obtained from those who are able to provide it at the lowest cost and where that information is most likely to be accurate. Although there may be some short-term costs for financial institutions and other businesses in order to provide this information, there are longer term benefits to those businesses and their customers– for example, more accurate and automatic withholding and increasing levels of compliance. There will also be long-term benefits to financial institutions as tax is integrated into business processes. Collaboration with financial institutions and other businesses deducting RWT will be essential to ensure that any RWT changes are effective in keeping overall compliance costs in this area to a minimum. In particular, a review needs to look at: • improving the timeliness of information to Inland Revenue; • the type of information provided; • how to best incorporate the requirement to provide information into normal business processes, in order to reduce compliance costs; • whether changes could remove the need for financial institutions to provide annual tax information to customers if it was already being provided directly to Inland Revenue; and • whether RWT systems could be used as an efficient method of collecting underpayments of tax. If you would like to read more about a review of the RWT rules go to Appendix 4. BANK WITHHOLDING TAXES FROM CAPITAL INCOME QUESTIONS FOR READERS 14 Is there anything else a review of the RWT rules should consider? 31 CONCEPTUAL VIEW OF INDIVIDUALS' INCOME TAX IN THE FUTURE Third parties would use software that meets Inland Revenue (IR) standards Information from the software would flow through to IR during the year. IR would use the information to detect risk Data is converted into usable information which could then be used for online income statement purposes Customers would simply check and confirm income details or correct those details and add additional income Assessment createdCredit/debit outcome Customer decides how to pay or receive monies CUSTOMER PERSPECTIVE PERSPECTIVE 32 Streamlining PAYE and withholding tax mechanisms will be the building blocks on which an individual’s improved experience of the tax system will be based. More comprehensive and accurate information received from these changes will allow for a fundamental review of how individuals interact with the tax system in the future. By way of background, a policy decision was made in the 1990s to try and remove the requirement to file income tax returns from as many individuals as possible. However, over time, this approach has created tension in the tax administration system between taxpayers who are not required to file, and those who are or who chose to do so in favourable circumstances (for example, to claim a refund). This creates fairness concerns for those who have to file and have tax to pay. Significant numbers of individuals are now either required to file returns or are choosing to do so. It is therefore timely to consider whether it is still desirable to keep as many individuals as possible from actively interacting with the tax system. This is particularly so as new technology now affords the possibility of Inland Revenue receiving accurate income information from employers, (see page 21) allowing Inland Revenue to provide an individual with a secure online tax statement showing those income details. This could include amalgamation of various tax interactions in one place (for example, including donations rebates). The key would be to make customers’ interaction with Inland Revenue as simple as possible. The only action required for the vast majority of customers would be to check and confirm their details. Where applicable, certain individuals would also need to report other income received – such as overseas income where there was no deduction of tax at source. International initiatives on the exchange of income information may also provide opportunities to provide overseas income details in the individual’s tax statement. More effective use of technology could allow Inland Revenue to automatically adjust withholding rates to collect any underpayments of tax, making it easier for individuals to meet their tax payment requirements. Refunds could be made quickly and automatically. This level of simple engagement would help ensure that individuals better understand what their tax obligations are, and how the wider tax system works. Over time, this would help improve voluntary compliance. If you would like to read more about how individuals could interact with the tax system in the future go to Appendix 5. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 15 Do you agree with the idea of interacting with the tax system by online tax statements? 16 If not, why not? 17 Is there anything else we should consider? INDIVIDUALS 33 SOCIAL POLICY DELIVERED THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM WORKING FOR FAMILIES CHILD SUPPORT PAID PARENTAL LEAVE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS SOCIAL POLICY SERVICES 34 Social policies administered by Inland Revenue (primarily Working for Families and Child Support) generally operate within the tax system on a yearly basis. Some of the potential changes may also affect Paid Parental Leave, Student Loan repayments and KiwiSaver. Some Working for Families and Child Support customers will go into debt, or are already in debt unnecessarily because of out-of-date information held about an individual or family. For Working for Families, debts or underpayments generally arise because of the annual assessment period, with payments made in advance or concurrently with the entitlement. This type of system requires upfront estimates of entitlement together with an end-of– period square-up. However, circumstances often change throughout the year, resulting in multiple contacts between Inland Revenue and individuals, or no contact at all (and therefore outdated information). Neither situation is a good result. The intention is to design processes that work for the customer and are fit for purpose. Processes should ideally match the timeliness of payments to customers’ needs, and ensure payments are received on a real-time basis. Reviewing the administration of these areas should include consideration of the suitability of the annual cycle and how to make better use of information from other sources. Any change to the annual cycle would be a fundamental shift in the administration of Child Support and Working for Families. More accurate and timely information, on a more regular basis, is likely to be achieved by advances in technology, ensuring easy and low-cost interactions with the people involved. Debt prevention would be the main benefit arising from improvements in this area. A system based on the ability to make frequent adjustments because of changing circumstances should mean less chance of going into debt.

QUESTIONS FOR READERS 18 Do you agree with the proposed direction of re-designing processes for administering social policies in the future? SOCIAL POLICY 35 Simplifying the tax administration system requires consideration of key tax administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax administration system. Changes to the way that taxpayers interact with Inland Revenue through digital services provide an opportunity to consider fundamental issues contained with the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section considers some of those changes. The role of Parliament and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Parliament both guides and constrains the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and the relationship between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and taxpayers. The power to levy taxes belongs to Parliament. Legislation is necessary to ensure certainty in the rules and to determine how much prescription versus Commissioner administrative decision-making is desirable. To a reasonable extent, the role of the Commissioner is clear and adequately expressed in the Tax Administration Act. 'Care and management' is a key component of this and works well as a mechanism to reflect that the Commissioner needs to apply her limited resources effectively and efficiently. However, there are areas in which the Commissioner’s role should be reviewed, such as how the 'care and management' provisions can be made more effective, and how they apply in non-tax areas. The role of taxpayers and third parties Self-assessment is a feature of the current New Zealand tax administration. It reflects the fact that, traditionally, a taxpayer has the information to best determine their own income and tax liability. Even in a world where assumptions about information collection and calculations are challenged, and online income tax returns are provided and calculated by Inland Revenue, the liability and obligation to pay tax ultimately still belongs to a taxpayer. This is known as 'self- assessment'. However, it will be important to test this assumption and consider the implications of any changes concerning the roles and obligations of taxpayers. An understanding of taxpayer obligations is core to the compliance and penalties legislation. Any changes to these obligations could have implications for penalties. A review of these policy and legislative settings needs to be considered in the context of any changes to the self- assessment framework. Information and secrecy Inland Revenue holds a lot of information, and has more interactions with New Zealanders than any other agency. Using and analysing information in a timely and THE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION 36 more efficient way will become more critical in the future. Consideration of the use, collection and disclosure of information will also be crucial. Critical to the effective administration of the tax system is the trust that customers have that their information will not be disclosed inappropriately – and this is reflected in the secrecy rules. Equally, Inland Revenue sometimes needs to disclose information to third parties when it is reasonable to do so. One of the Government’s objectives for the future tax administration is to use information more effectively within Inland Revenue and to facilitate greater co-operation across government. The Government wants agencies to 'to use information as an asset'. In doing so, a number of potential tensions will need to be reconciled to meet these objectives, including: • the interplay between information sharing and tax secrecy, and any potential impact on the integrity of the tax system; • the differences (if any) between non-taxpayer-specific information and taxpayer-specific information; • the treatment of information for social policy purposes; • intelligence sharing and participation in cross-agency initiatives; • co-location and joint service provision with other government agencies; • the implication of greater information collection via accounting software and/or intermediaries; and • how to manage the collection, storage and use of large external data sets. Legislative structure of the Tax Administration Act As an umbrella act the Tax Administration Act should provide a consistent administrative framework across the Inland Revenue Acts. Consideration would need to be given not only to the interplay of the Tax Administration Act with the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act, but also to the level of consistency that is necessary or desirable between the legislation dealing with tax matters and various social policy functions. Specific tax policy work in this area will necessitate their own changes to the Tax Administration Act. As a result, certain provisions will become obsolete. A starting point for a new Tax Administration Act could be to re-order provisions, including those that can sensibly be carried over from other Inland Revenue Acts. If you would like to read more about the policy and legislative framework for tax administration go to Appendix 7. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 19 Do you agree that the correct areas are being looked at in reviewing the policy and legislative framework for tax administration? 37 NEXT STEPS The following sets out a very high- level summary of the scope of the tax policy work discussed in this Green paper, together with indicative dates when subsequent public consultation may occur. Enabling secure digital services In tandem with this Green paper a discussion document on Providing better digital services in a tax administration context has been released. That paper considers whether secure digital services can be delivered using the current policy and legislative framework. In particular, it identifies legislative and other barriers to moving to digital services, and discusses options to help move people to digital services (including incentives, disincentives and, where appropriate, requiring people to use of digital services). The policy and legislative framework for tax administration In the second half of 2015 a discussion document on developing a tax administration framework fit for the 21 st century will be released. This will discuss, for example, the respective roles of Parliament, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and customers. Employment income In the second half of 2015, two discussion documents on employment income will be released. The first will focus on: • the collection of information for PAYE purposes; and • modernising the PAYE rules more generally. The second will focus on: • enhancing withholding taxes to cover ‘employment-like’ income. Withholding taxes on capital income In 2016 a discussion document on streamlining the collection of information relating to other withholding regimes will be released. This document will look at ways of ensuring that sources of income with tax deducted at source (for example, interest and dividends) are accurately and promptly recorded. Individuals’ taxation In 2016 a discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals – for example, in relation to the pre-population of tax returns and more efficient payment and debt mechanisms – will be released. Investment income information 2016 Better digital services M arch 2015 Business taxation 2016 Individuals’ interactions with IR 2016 Rules for tax administration 2015 Easier information provision for PAY E /G S T 2015 Withholding taxes on labour income 2015 Social Policy 2 017 Green Paper on Tax Administration M arch 2015 38 Business taxation From 2015–2016, a number of discussion documents focussed on improving the tax system for businesses will be released. These will look at streamlining business tax processes, for example, in relation to provisional tax, small businesses, the collection of information, and on penalties and interest. Social policy From 2017 onwards, a number of discussion documents on various social policy issues such as encouraging people to update or confirm personal circumstances during the assessment period – will be released. Other areas of potential focus may include: • periods of assessment and payment; • aligning definitions and rules across common social policy elements; and • debt prevention and collection. 39 APPENDIX 1 POLICY CONSIDERATIONS NEW ZEALAND’S TAX SYSTEM 1.1 Having a good overall tax system means having both good tax policies and good administrative systems. Both of these elements need to go hand in hand. Costs associated with raising taxes 1. 2 Taxes create costs. As well as the taxes themselves, there are additional costs that are sometimes referred to as 'deadweight costs'. These include compliance costs to customers and administrative costs to Inland Revenue, and also distortionary costs due to the way that taxes influence behaviour. For example, they can discourage people from working, saving, starting a business or increasing their skills. Taxes can bias the ways in which people work or save. Taxes can also discourage firms from investing or cause them to invest in inefficient ways. It is important to keep the overall costs of raising tax to a minimum. 1. 3 Reducing compliance costs for businesses, in particular small and medium enterprises (SMEs), is an important goal for the Government. Although there is evidence that tax compliance costs for New Zealand individuals and SMEs are likely to be low by international standards , given the large number of SMEs operating in New Zealand, overall tax compliance costs for this group as a whole are likely to represent a significant cost to the economy. In 2009, compliance costs for SMEs alone were estimated at $2.5 billion which was more than 1% of GDP. Total compliance costs in the United States have been estimated as 10% of tax collections which in New Zealand would amount to 3-4% of GDP. It is therefore very important that we continue to contain tax compliance costs. New Zealand’s tax policies 1.4 The aim of New Zealand’s tax policies is to tax as broad a range of income and expenditure as practicable at rates that are as low as possible. Known as the broad-base, low- rate (BBLR) approach, this provides a coherent and robust revenue base and promotes equity and fairness, economic efficiency and growth, and revenue integrity. 1. 5 It also helps keep administration and compliance costs low. It is a much more coherent way of levying tax compared with most OECD countries. Endorsement of New Zealand's tax policies 1.6 New Zealand’s tax policies work well and are held in high regard internationally.1 A number of independent domestic reviews of the tax system have also been undertaken in recent years, and have fundamentally supported New Zealand's underlying tax system and BBLR framework. 2 Future challenges 1.7 There are long-term fiscal pressures that future Governments will need to consider. An ageing population, coupled with the increasing demand for world class healthcare and other services, will contribute to these pressures. 1. 8 We should do everything possible to ensure high levels of compliance with the tax system to manage these fiscal pressures. Boosting levels of compliance is an important part of the Government's review of tax administration. Inland Revenue’s tax administrative framework 1.9 Inland Revenue aims to make it as easy as possible for people to comply with the tax system and to access their social policy entitlements delivered through the tax system. It also aims to make it hard for people not to comply. The goal is to provide services that are value-for-money while maintaining the integrity of the tax system. 1.10 The way that Inland Revenue currently operates administratively largely reflects a set of sensible decisions on how to make marginal improvements or take on new tasks given the legacy of the systems that are already in place. The Government has not, until now, stood back and had a fundamental look at how tax might best be administered if it were starting from scratch. 40 INLAND REVENUE’S BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME 1.11 Inland Revenue is embarking on a once-in-a- generation opportunity to make changes to New Zealand’s tax administration system to meet current and future needs. The Government has agreed in principle to a long-term business transformation programme to look at different ways of delivering tax and social policy. This includes re-shaping the way Inland Revenue works with taxpayers, and looking at possible changes to, amongst other pieces of legislation, the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1.12 This is far more than just updating a computing system. Rather, it is a chance to have a fundamental look at tax administration in New Zealand and see what changes need to be made as Inland Revenue moves further into the 21 st century. 1.13 The world is changing, with huge improvements in ways of doing business. Ways of doing business that were acceptable 10 or 20 years ago will no longer meet the demands of customers. This also has wider implications beyond Inland Revenue – appropriate information sharing between Government agencies is also important to deliver efficient outcomes for New Zealanders. 1.14 It is therefore vital that Government and Inland Revenue establish the sort of tax administration services that taxpayers, third parties, advisors, and users of social policy services actually want and require, and which minimise the additional effort required to meet tax obligations and receive payments. 1.15 Any future tax administration system should also be effectively enforced and produce high levels of voluntary compliance. We want to achieve this while reducing the administration and compliance costs associated with raising tax. 1.16 Tax administration requires integrity and coherence – customers need to believe in the value of the system and feel as if there is a level playing field for all concerned, with people who do not comply being treated effectively and consistently. 1.17 New Zealand’s very simple policy framework sets a sound base for such a transition, and should help ensure a much simpler tax administration than is required in other countries. CURRENT PROBLEMS AND ISSUES TO CONSIDER Systems and processes 1.18 The current revenue system is under increasing pressure. Major tax and social policy initiatives are difficult to implement given core technology and business processes. These demands have resulted in various system modifications, manual interventions and workarounds that have produced layers of complexity and cost for government and taxpayers. 1.19 As a result, current systems and processes pose significant challenges and risks. These include: • inability to provide the services that customers are and will increasingly demand in a future digital age; • inability to fully support the delivery of business initiatives across the wider public sector; • inability to benefit fully from information and expertise used across the wider public sector; • operational failure, potentially impacting the Government’s revenue collection and distribution; and • ability to implement the Government’s tax and social policy initiatives in a timely and efficient manner. 1. 20 Business transformation affords Inland Revenue the opportunity to address these issues. Compliance and administration costs 1. 21 As part of the trade-offs considered in any changes, it is crucial not to fall into the trap of merely shifting costs away from government onto taxpayers. Reforms will not be successful if they cut administration costs but these are 41 more than offset by additional compliance costs on the private sector. 1. 22 Nor should measures be considered that reduce administration or compliance costs but lead to higher overall costs as a result of greater distortionary costs. Some simplistic options that may reduce compliance costs (for example, a turnover tax) might have relatively low administration and compliance costs but extremely high distortionary costs. 1. 23 Although it is likely that New Zealand SMEs individually have low compliance costs by international standards, given the large number of such firms in New Zealand, aggregate compliance costs for these firms are large. It is important to focus on containing these costs. 1. 24 This does not mean that tax concessions should be introduced for SMEs, however, as tax costs and tax compliance costs should not be confused. Tax breaks for a particular sector are likely to reduce economic efficiency and growth by encouraging resources to flow into less productive activities. They are counter to the BBLR philosophy. It may, however, be possible to make some changes that result in tax simplification measures that reduce compliance costs for SMEs without a substantial fiscal impact. 1. 25 There are also reasons to be wary of creating too much choice. Compliance costs tend to rise in countries that give SMEs too many options for paying tax. This can encourage SMEs to calculate their tax liability a number of ways to find which involves the lowest tax payments (perversely, at the cost of increased compliance). 1. 26 Also, as much as possible, it is undesirable to have rules that create difficult boundaries and disincentives for successful firms increasing in size. 1. 27 In addition to core policy changes, there will be other opportunities for simplifying the tax system by more effective reliance on technology and existing business systems (see Appendix 2 for more details). Facilitating compliance 1. 28 Effective tax systems rely on facilitating compliance by customers. Addressing errors or mistakes after the event imposes significant costs on both Inland Revenue and the customer. It is more effective and efficient to consider what can be done to facilitate compliance and enable customers to file tax returns and make entitlement claims that are correct, for example, to get it right from the start. 1. 29 The elements of an approach that facilitates compliance include: • designing a tax system which makes it easy to comply and difficult not to; • directing attention to the pre-filing stage and proactively targeting high risk areas and segments; and • where possible, incorporating tax and social policy processes within a customer's everyday life – that is, designing systems that align or build off the customer's own processes and lifecycle. 1. 30 To effectively facilitate compliance, Inland Revenue must continue to build its understanding of different groups of customers, their environments, and the factors that drive their behaviour (capability, motivation and opportunity). This will help shape the necessary actions that Inland Revenue needs to take to help promote compliance. Increased use of effective withholding regimes 1. 31 International studies have found very high levels of compliance for certain forms of tax (in particular, for withholding taxes, such as PAYE) and considerably lower rates of compliance for others, such as self-declared income. This suggests that greater use of withholding schemes, wherever possible (and appropriate) should be encouraged. 1. 32 The effectiveness of withholding at source is reflected in the fact that the current New Zealand tax administration 42 system generally works well for individuals whose income is derived solely from salary and wages that are subject to tax withholding regimes. This is consistent with the experiences faced by other modern tax systems. In operating withholding taxes, governments recognise the reliance placed on businesses that operate the withholding in question. 1. 33 The system works less well, however, in other circumstances – in particular, when tax on investment or other income is either not withheld or withheld at the incorrect rate. This can lead to costly square-ups when returns are filed, or unfairness and inefficiencies if they are not. This particular problem, if not addressed, is likely to grow with the onset of an ageing population where more people earn a larger proportion of their income from capital sources. Filing obligations 1. 34 The current tax obligations on individuals vary, based on historic distinctions made. A policy decision was made previously to try and remove the requirement to file income tax returns from as many individuals as possible. This resulted in relatively few salary and wage-earners in New Zealand filing income tax returns compared with other countries. 1. 35 This, over time, created a tension in the tax administration system between customers who are not required to file and those who are. As a customer’s circumstances change, their filing obligations can also change, for example, becoming eligible for Working for Families tax credits. 1. 36 In addition, significant numbers of individuals are now either required to file or are, in certain circumstances, given the option to do so in favourable circumstances. 1. 37 Individuals earning foreign income, rental income or business income, or who are receiving Working for Families tax credits, are required to file tax returns. Others are not required to do so. These differences in filing requirements may result in some being completely unaware that they may not be complying with their obligations. 1. 38 It may now be more appropriate, and fair, to treat individual customers more consistently than at present. Modern technology could provide scope for a dramatic reduction in the costs of interacting with the tax system, and allow for an efficient squaring-up of refunds or liabilities where required. 1. 39 Appendix 5 will explore the possibility of whether Inland Revenue can provide more extensive pre-populated information on tax returns available to individual taxpayers. For those with simple affairs and without business, rental or foreign income, filling a tax return might be no more complex than confirming whether the sources of income that Inland Revenue identifies are the only sources of income. 1.40 A practical difficulty is in getting effective withholding rates in place, and minimising the costs involved in squaring up liabilities and refunds when tax has been withheld at rates that do not reflect the true end-of-year tax position. The trade-off with trying to make withholding tax more accurate is the potential increase in compliance costs for the withholder and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 1.41 Again, technology may help this by making square- ups much less costly. This Green paper will also be exploring whether it is possible to simplify square-ups with automatic bank transfers to those who have paid too much and higher rates of future withholding on those who have paid too little. Automatic square-ups could reduce pressure points around 'secondary tax', along with improvements to the rates at which secondary tax is withheld. Other issues 1.42 Other issues to consider include problems relating to the provision of information. There are currently problems with the sufficiency and timeliness of collection of information, and the accuracy of that information. 1.43 When information is inaccurate there are also downstream problems with the timeliness of intervention or correction of that information. 43 1.4 4 Parallel questions arise around whether other features of the current tax system are really what customers expect in the 21 st century. These include: • the Employer Monthly Schedule and other withholding systems – are they required to be updated to meet employers’ needs; • whether businesses, in particularly those with complex tax affairs, are afforded the right level of certainty to effectively manage their tax affairs in a timely and efficient manner; • the way that businesses are required to pay tax, including the estimation of provisional tax; • whether compliance with FBT can be simplified; and • are the interactions between tax and social assistance overly complex. KEY BENEFITS ARISING 1.45 Some of the benefits that the potential changes discussed in this Green paper, when taken as a whole, should ideally achieve include: • Making it easier for customers to see their overall tax and social policy position, and to pay tax and meet social policy obligations. • Increasing predictability for customers, by: • providing easy digital access to their accounts (and alternatives for those without such access); • providing earlier and simpler transactions; • providing effective and timely solutions to their pressing issues and problems (for example, when providing binding rulings); • access to the right information and help at the right time; • using a business's normal business processes and systems to meet tax obligations; • having a low cost of contact; • being designed for a digital world, not a paper world; • improving response times; and • improving the collection, accuracy and timeliness of information to simplify and better tailor interactions. • Making it harder for customers to fall into debt in the first place, and also making it easier for them to correct if they do. • Reducing compliance and administration costs. • Supporting broader 'all-of-government' goals and providing value-for-money for the Government. • Ensuring the on-going surety and integrity of the tax and social policy system. • Making it easier and less expensive for customers to get it right and meet their obligations (and harder for them to get it wrong). • Providing sufficient information so that key policy concerns and audit risks can be identified easily. • Providing flexibility to cater for future changes. • Having an increased customer-focussed approach. 1.46 In short, Inland Revenue’s tax and social policy systems should be simple and make it easy to get right and hard to get wrong, be quick and low effort to use, provide more certainty, and should not require duplication of effort by customers or associated third parties. The systems should help customers to get things right from the start. They must also be flexible enough to move with technology developments. 44 1.47 This will not be an easy shift to make, or a quick one, but it is absolutely necessary for change to happen. KEY ASSUMPTIONS 1.48 Some key assumptions have been made during the early development of the policy issues that are likely to underpin Inland Revenue’s business transformation. These include: • Key tax bases will remain substantially in place and New Zealand will continue with its BBLR approach. There are no fundamental changes currently planned to either income tax (individuals and corporates) or GST. Previous comprehensive tax reviews, most recently by the 2010 Tax Working Group , provide a high degree of support for this assumption. • Social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (for example, in relation to Working for Families, Child Support, Student Loans repayments and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work. 1 See, for example: - Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report (http://www2.deloitte.com/content/ dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-ap-2014-tax-complexity-survey.pdf) - Washington DC Tax Foundation’s 2014 international tax competitiveness index (see http://taxfoundation.org/article/2014-international-tax-competitiveness-index) 2 For example the McLeod Review in 2001 and, more recently, the Tax Working Group in 2010 45 APPENDIX 2 THE FUTURE FOR BUSINESS PROCESSES – PAYE 2 .1 PAYE (pay as you earn) is a tax withholding regime for salary and wages. PAYE information is received monthly from employers (or PAYE intermediaries) through the provision of Employer Monthly Schedules (EMS). Income, tax code, and tax deduction information is accumulated on an income year basis and used to support the administration of the income tax and social policy systems. 2.2 The PAYE system is also used to collect: • ACC earner levies; • Child support obligations; • Student loan repayment obligations; • Employer superannuation contribution tax; • tax arrears; and • KiwiSaver and complying superannuation fund contributions (both employer and employee contributions). 2.3 This appendix looks at three issues relating to employment income and similar income types. These are: • the collection of PAYE information; • modernisation of the PAYE rules more generally; and • enhancing withholding taxes to cover ‘employment- like’ income. COLLECTION OF PAYE INFORMATION 2.4 The changes described in this Green paper are premised, amongst other things, on the efficient provision of information – in particular the timely supply of information that can be effectively used by taxpayers, Inland Revenue and, where appropriate, wider government. 2.5 The EMS has, in theory, a lot of positive attributes. It provides a wealth of relevant information that is vital when determining the tax position of New Zealand salary and wage earners. 2.6 The EMS therefore provides the starting point for any wider policy-led transformation changes, in particular, addressing some of the problems that limit its current effectiveness. Current problems 2.7 The methods used by employers to submit PAYE information is still largely paper-based. Even when electronic filing is used or required, the submission of returns is often an additional process for businesses and is not aligned to businesses’ accounting or payroll processes. 2.8 From an Inland Revenue perspective, there is also currently limited validation occurring at the time information is submitted, meaning that inaccurate information is being accepted. The information collected also lacks sufficient detail to allow deduction accuracy to be checked. This, in turn, places limitations on downstream interventions. 2.9 The level of duplication, correction or other interventions required by employers or Inland Revenue before the information can be effectively used is a severe shortcoming in the current provision of EMSs. Also, the inefficient use of available information from an all- of-government perspective, where appropriate, is not realising the full potential of information held. Potential changes Objectives 2 .10 Greater use of digital services provides an opportunity to: • make better use of businesses' natural systems to provide information; • improve the timeliness and accuracy of information received; 46 • have accurate business rules incorporated into software packages; • reduce the level of duplication, correction and other interventions required by employers, intermediaries or Inland Revenue before the information can be effectively used; and • improve the use of available information from an all-of- government perspective, and to help ensure customers only have to supply information to government once. 2 .11 Some specific objectives for streamlining the collection of PAYE information are that any proposed solution should: • wherever possible, be integrated into employers' own systems; • be low effort for customers, and reduce compliance costs for all, including reducing the need for employers to contact Inland Revenue; • produce timely information from employers which is accurate (right amount), complete (error free); • be shared with other agencies (where appropriate); • allow Inland Revenue to pro-actively identify any incorrect data or assumptions, so that employers can correct information immediately and not have to deal with errors at a later date; • deliver digital and paperless interactions – for example, transactions that are processed directly from employers' own systems to Inland Revenue, with certainty of delivery and outcome; • be co-designed with taxpayers and their intermediaries (e.g. software developers and agents); • be able to be reused for other products and services; and • be agile and allow future changes (to policy and processes) to be made easily, quickly and cheaply. Likely scope of review 2 .12 The policy and legislative framework must be fit-for- purpose to improve and streamline the collection of PAYE information. In developing this framework, the following issues will need to be carefully considered. 2 .13 Systems issues – Replacing current EMS and employer deduction (and GST return) forms with automatic digital data transfers – for example, via payroll/accounting software rather than as a separate manual intensive process. However, this begs the question about what to do for employers that do not currently use electronic business processes. 2 .14 Information requirement issues – How should Inland Revenue ideally obtain information about employees? For example, employees could themselves provide or update information directly to Inland Revenue through digital channels, rather than via their employer. Alternatively, employers could provide employee information to Inland Revenue for subsequent validation. 2 .15 At what point is information considered accurate and complete? If Inland Revenue does not accept a return until it is correct, or rejects it, what is the status of the information in the meantime? What happens if a taxpayer challenges the information? 2 .16 Privacy and employee information – Should employees be able to keep private information (for example, child support information) between themselves and Inland Revenue rather than involving their employer, with employers seeing only the overall deduction amount or rate? 2 .17 Timing issues – Should the timing of PAYE information provided to Inland Revenue align to the time that salaries are paid to employees? Or, should payment dates for PAYE align to the time that salary/wages are paid to employees, or continue to be paid at a later date? 47 2 .18 Validation issues – Receiving information in a more timely manner will likely give Inland Revenue the ability to determine whether there are mistakes – for example, when an individual clearly appears to be on an incorrect tax code. What interventions could Inland Revenue potentially make to remedy likely mistakes more quickly? 2 .19 Other issues: • What happens when a business starts or ceases to be an employer? • What happens when a new employee is taken on, or one leaves? • What happens to casual or seasonal employees who work for several employers, or to beneficiaries who are also working? • Should there be consistency between paper returns (to the extent they remain) and new electronic processes? • What are the likely impacts for agents, nominated persons, software providers etc? • Is it appropriate to review the policy settings for the current payroll subsidy to assess if it could be used more? 2.20 At this stage, no specific proposals are being made on any of these issues. The comments here are a series of considerations that are required to be worked through by further policy development and consultation. Initial options for consideration 2 . 21 Potential high-level changes that could be made to improve the way the EMS operates for employers, intermediaries and Inland Revenue, and to provide a platform for wider changes include: • avoiding unnecessary duplication by integrating PAYE into existing business systems (for example, the payroll system), so that EMS becomes part of a wider process rather than an additional process; • allowing business systems to talk directly to Inland Revenue systems, and vice versa; • easy amendment and correction of tax codes; • ensuring that information provided is validated immediately; and • verification of information to allow EMS to be better used to increase accuracy of payments and to collect any underpayments of tax. 2.22 A focus on the transfer of data, rather than on the current prescriptive filing of 'returns', means information can potentially be provided any time during an applicable period, rather than just at the end of a month. Although there will still likely be time limits by when information (and payment) must be made, such a change will none-the- less provide more flexibility for employers. For example, it might allow for corrections to be made on an on-going basis rather than at a later date. 2.23 Any future changes will still require data to be accurate and timely before any new process can be considered effective. Innovation by the private sector will therefore be an important factor in ensuring that any PAYE changes are successful, in particular in relation to making sure that 'normal' business processes are used wherever possible. 2.24 These changes will not just be confined to the PAYE information – the same issues and principles will also apply to other requirements. For example, the ability to use a business’s own systems should equally apply to GST information requirements. MODERNISING THE PAYE RULES MORE GENERALLY 2.25 In addition to looking at issues connected to potential changes to the way that PAYE information is provided, it is also timely to look at the PAYE rules more generally, to ensure that they remain fit-for-purpose. 2.26 The rules have not been fundamentally reviewed since 48 their introduction in 1957, so it is important to investigate whether improvements can be made and to investigate whether the rules still reflect modern employment practices. Current problems 2.27 PAYE is an efficient and effective means to collect income tax from salary or wage income. It is important to note that the underlying policy for PAYE remains sound. 2.28 That said, as part of the focus to remove salary or wage earners from the requirement to file annual tax returns, some complexity has been added to the PAYE rules to ensure that tax is withheld at the correct current marginal rate wherever possible.3 2.29 Further complexity has also been added due to the non-alignment of rules in certain circumstances – for example, separate rules exist for income tax rates and KiwiSaver rates. This can cause practical difficulties when these rates change. 2.30 There may now be an opportunity, therefore, to review the PAYE rules to see if they can be simplified. This is because the need for precise accuracy could potentially be reduced if there is no longer a desire to reduce the number of individuals required to interact with the revenue system (for further details see Appendix 5 on individuals). Potential changes Objectives 2 . 31 Removing undue complexity and providing more clarity in the application of the PAYE rules so that they are more user-friendly is likely to be positive for employers. 2.32 One of the key objectives should be to reduce some of the unnecessary compliance costs currently experienced by employers in applying the current rules. Employers and payroll developers frequently experience a number of issues in relation to the application of the PAYE rules. Although individual issues may be minor, they can cause annoyance. 2.33 Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme affords the opportunity to review these rules as part of the wider review of tax administration. This is particularly important given the fact that PAYE collects such a significant part of New Zealand's revenue. Likely scope of review 2.34 There are a number of factors influencing the accuracy of the amount of PAYE deducted. These include use of the correct tax code, calculation accuracy (for both payroll packages and manual calculations), and other changes in employee information. 2.35 The scope of any wider look at the PAYE rules will likely cover: • A review of existing PAYE rules to ensure that they are fit for purpose under a future PAYE (where calculations are, in general, done by software and not manually), with a particular focus on: • extra pays, due to the complexity of the current calculation; • holiday pay, due to the lack of clarity over how holiday pay is to be taxed (lump sum payments versus regular payments of holiday pay in lieu of actual salary or wages); • IR 56 payers – whether the payer should be made to withhold and deal with the PAYE obligations rather than the recipient; • the employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)4 deduction rate, due to the compliance costs associated with the annual calculation of the rate to be applied for the current year; • secondary tax codes and other flat PAYE rates – for example, is it possible to deal with these rates through the use of special tax codes (due to better income information being received during the year); and 49 • how to apportion tax when there is a change in the rate of withholding during a pay period. • Rationalisation of how employment remuneration is taxed and whether all forms of remuneration can be brought under the PAYE umbrella. For example, can some or all of fringe benefits, employer superannuation contributions and employee share schemes income be incorporated into the PAYE rules? • Whether one-off payments can be included in the PAYE rules to avoid taxpayers becoming provisional tax payers. • Review of how the PAYE rules apply to cross-border employment relationships (for example, a New Zealand business setting up a branch in a foreign jurisdiction, and whether the PAYE rules apply to the employment of workers resident in the foreign jurisdiction). • Wage protection – in exploring whether more deductions through PAYE is appropriate, consideration of a cap on the level of these deductions to ensure employees receive a sufficient minimum net payment will be important. 2.36 Again, it should be noted that no firm proposals are being made at this stage – instead, the issues noted above need to be explored in more detail before this can occur. ENHANCING WITHHOLDING TAXES TO COVER ‘EMPLOYMENT-LIKE’ INCOME 2.37 Withholding tax arrangements are generally considered to be the foundation of an effective tax administration. Such arrangements impose an obligation on third parties (such as employers or banks) to withhold an amount of tax from payment of income to taxpayers. 2.38 Withholding taxes are a more cost-effective way for taxpayers and the revenue authority to transact. They help reduce the ability to understate income, and reduce the incidence of unpaid taxes. 2.39 New Zealand currently has a robust framework for the withholding of employment income as it relates to those in a traditional employer-employee situation. Such workers are subject to PAYE on progressive income tax rates. For many of these workers these source deductions provide a fairly accurate withholding of their tax obligation. 2.40 For those people who earn their employment income in less standard work arrangements (for example, as self- employed or independent contractors) the picture is less simple. Certain types of income fall within the 'schedular payment' rules (a subset of the PAYE rules) and deductions at a flat rate must be made by the payer. 2 .41 Independent contractor income that does not fall within the schedular payment rules is not subject to source deduction. These taxpayers must instead file income tax returns each year and pay their tax themselves and, if they have a year-end tax liability of greater than $2,500, pay provisional tax. In this case it is not clear that the framework is as robust. 2.42 Business transformation provides an opportunity to consider whether there are ways to improve and simplify taxpayers’ interactions with Inland Revenue in this area. 2.43 As the tax administration system works well in respect of salary and wages – where there is a well-established withholding regime – consideration should be given to whether there is scope to expand withholding to cover a greater range of employment-like payments. This could provide scope to improve compliance, fairness and efficiency. Current problems 2.44 The schedular payment rules were introduced in 1957, alongside the introduction of PAYE. The rules generally cover situations when there is no true employment relationship (noting that since 1986 receivers of schedular payments are able to claim expenditure incurred in deriving their income, while employees are not). 2.45 The rules apply to payments for certain listed 50 activities. Activities subject to this form of withholding range from the provision of personal care, to agricultural services and non-resident contractors, and include proceeds from the sales of goods such as whitebait and sphagnum moss. There are a number of exclusions, including salary and wages, extra pays and any payments covered by an exemption certificate. 2.46 Although the scope of the rules and the tax rates have been reviewed from time to time, the rules have evolved through piecemeal extension, rather than as a result of a fundamental review of the type of tax deduction system needed to complement the PAYE system. 2.47 Given there have been significant changes to the economy and to the way in which some people are engaged during this period, inconsistencies in the rules have emerged. For example, there has been growth in new industries which provide for stand-alone contractors who have few, if any, expenses. 2.48 Those industries with low or no expenses might be considered good candidates for inclusion in a more comprehensive withholding regime, as the lack of expenses would indicate that withholding at (or near) marginal tax rates would be reasonably accurate. This would likely have the benefit of taking a number of contractors out of the provisional tax regime, and reduce the added compliance this brings. 2.49 Another area of concern is potential non-compliance by migrant workers. For example, preliminary analysis over the past three years indicates that some migrant workers are incorporating companies, which are excluded from withholding requirements, and entering into contracts to provide their services to New Zealand businesses. There is a risk that these individuals may leave New Zealand within two years and not comply with their tax obligations – that is, not file tax returns and not pay tax. 2.50 This tax compliance concern could potentially apply to certain geographical areas as well as to industries that heavily rely on migrant workers operating as contractors (for example, some parts of the tourism industry). 2. 51 As previously noted, another important aspect of the Government's modernisation programme is improving the information that Inland Revenue collects and holds regarding taxpayers and their obligations, and streamlining and improving the collection of this information. 2.52 Expanding withholding taxes would assist in improving gaps in information collected. Indeed, there may be a case for some payments to not require withholding, but rather to have enhanced reporting requirements imposed on some people who engage contractors or make significant payments in cash. Potential changes Objectives 2.53 As the Government envisages a future where customers’ systems are able to interact more freely with Inland Revenue’s system, there is an opportunity to expand withholding and/or reporting without significantly increasing the compliance costs of the parties making payments (provided the design of systems allows the required information to easily be extracted from customers' systems and passed through to Inland Revenue). 2.54 The main objective is the provision of timely information from businesses which is accurate, comprehensive, error-free and able to be shared with other government agencies, where appropriate. 2.55 Solutions in this area would ideally reduce the sum of compliance and administration costs for customers and the Government as a whole, while at the same time increase compliance levels from all customers. Ideally there would be other benefits as well, such as reducing the possibility of customers falling into debt. In practice there are likely to be trade-offs in all of this. An important consideration is to ensure that any change does not just merely shift the cost of compliance from Inland Revenue to business. 51 Likely scope of review 2.56 This review will initially look at withholding taxes in situations that are similar to employment – such as those characterised as independent contractors. This means predominantly focussing on contracts for the supply of labour (and labour and materials). 2.57 In particular, key areas that are proposed as part of this work include: • Whether withholding at source can also be considered in a wider range of situations (for example, to cover particular industries)? • What degree of accuracy is desirable when withholding – for example, the use of a single flat rate, a range of flat rates, or some degree of greater accuracy via the use of PAYE rates or special tax codes? • Who specifically will be subject to withholding – which payees and which payers? • Are there situations when reporting requirements rather than withholding would be sufficient? • What is done for those people in situations when withholding is not possible (either in part or in full)? • To what extent would corporate contractors fit within any new rules (given currently, in most circumstances, withholding only applies to individuals, not corporates). For example, would it only cover individuals and entities with one employee, or might it extend further? 2.58 The review will also include consideration of the existing schedular payment rules and whether this is a model that should remain, be expanded upon, or be included in any new withholding rules. 2.59 The Government may, where it has concerns with voluntary compliance, look to address the scope of the PAYE and the schedular payment rules. 2.60 Also, implications outside of the tax system will need to be taken into account – for example, ACC levies, minimum wage obligations and other general employment law considerations. 3 The marginal tax rate is the tax on the next dollar earned. 4 Employer superannuation contribution tax is the tax deducted by the employer on employer contributions to a superannuation fund for example, KiwiSaver. 52 BUSINESS TAX APPENDIX 3 3.1 Initial feedback (including from the Tax Administration for the 21 st Century conference, and from business groups) has primarily focussed on a need for speed, predictability, resolving issues with provisional tax, and low business risk in business taxation matters. Inland Revenue should use new technology to allow more focus on high-value services to taxpayers, to help enable them to better manage their tax affairs. 3.2 This, together with a desire to see improved compliance levels and lower tax compliance costs (which are seen as deadweight and unproductive to the New Zealand economy), are key factors to consider in any business tax changes. 3.3 It is important to consider, and develop further with relevant stakeholders, what the key issues are. Businesses want access to the right people at the right time to ensure that the business is doing the right thing. Are there aspects of running a business that present specific issues – such as the impact of taking on more staff or other key events? Although thinking in the business tax space is less developed currently than for other areas being considered, the scope of any change investigated will likely involve developing responses to the following issues: • What are the actual tax compliance issues being faced from a business’s perspective – for example, what is the real scope of the problems being considered? • How big are these problems and what are the relative priorities? • What would the impact be if these problems are not solved? • The potential cost implications of any possible solutions. 3.4 Although this Green paper explores, at a high level, some initial issues for feedback reflecting initial concerns raised by businesses, the Government is particularly interested to find out if there are other, or more important areas of focus that would deliver the most benefits to business. OVERALL OBJECTIVES 3.5 It is worth restating that, wherever possible (and appropriate), any proposed business tax changes should fit within the existing broad-base, low-rate tax policy framework. 3.6 In addition to the policy framework considered in Appendix 1, there are other more specific objectives for potential business income tax changes that should result in the following outcomes: • reduced overall compliance and administration costs for businesses and the Government; • better voluntary compliance; • a high level of predictability for taxpayers; • effective and timely solutions to taxpayers’ pressing issues and problems (for example, when providing binding rulings); • where possible and appropriate, have a low cost of contact; • be designed for a digital world, not a paper world, using existing business processes wherever possible; • work in a way that helps prevent tax debt arising in the first place, while efficiently allowing for its recovery when this is not possible; • provide good information so that key policy concerns and audit risks can be identified easily, recognising that businesses that are low risks should have lower information requirements; • collect revenue as companies earn their income without imposing excessive compliance costs on taxpayers; • provide value-for-money for the Government; and • be flexible enough to cater for future changes. 53 3.7 The issues briefly explored as part of this Green paper are: • In relation to provisional tax, in particular exploring whether there are more effective, or more certain, methods available for calculating and paying provisional tax. • Exploring ways to simplify interactions with small businesses, to reduce compliance costs and provide more assistance to these businesses. • Moving away from the current focus on detailed tax 'returns' to a concept where the focus is instead on providing key information, and this information is provided digitally, in a way that fits the size and nature of individual businesses. PROVISIONAL TAX 3.8 Initial feedback indicates that the calculation and payment of provisional and terminal tax currently presents a number of problems for many businesses. 3.9 While acknowledging that there are pressure points associated with the payment of provisional tax, it is important to reiterate that, to the extent possible, it is desirable that firms pay tax as their income is earned. This is consistent and equitable with the way in which other taxpayers are taxed, and is necessary to ensure government finances are effectively managed. 3.10 The fiscal implications of any changes will need to be carefully scrutinised when assessing the merit of any changes. 3 .11 Also, the design of any changes will have to be very carefully worked through with businesses and their advisors, so that any impacts on businesses’ cashflows can be fully considered. 3.12 The process of paying provisional tax should be as painless and easy to comply with as possible. Current problems 3.13 There is an inherent trade-off between the accuracy of the payment of business income tax as income is earned, and compliance costs. 3.14 The calculation and payment of provisional and terminal tax currently presents a number of problems for both businesses and Inland Revenue. Key amongst these are: • use-of-money interest risk for businesses, resulting from the need to estimate annual tax liabilities part- way through a year of assessment for provisional tax purposes; • compliance costs associated with estimating liabilities before the year of assessment has ended. Initial feedback has centred around a desire for businesses to be able to focus more on growing their businesses rather than estimating future tax liabilities; and • the one-off square-up nature of terminal tax can present cashflow difficulties for businesses, in particular, because of the nature of the current rules for new businesses. This also has knock-on effects for Inland Revenue in its enforcement activities. Objectives 3.15 Any changes ultimately proposed for provisional tax should take into account, and balance, the following specific objectives and considerations: • To the extent possible, provisional tax payments should align with when and how firms generate their cash flows. • Where appropriate, businesses should be able to rely on existing business processes and technology (for example effective third-party accounting software providers). 54 • The impact that any change has on encouraging compliance – making it easy to comply and difficult to get wrong. • Compliance cost savings for customers. • The impact that use-of-money-interest on underpayments has on businesses. • Helping to prevent businesses from falling into tax debt. • The need for the Government to effectively and responsibly manage the country’s finances – for example, fully consider the fiscal implications of any change. • Equity issues between different customers. Initial options for consideration Business PAYE 3.16 In the future, the calculation and payment of business income tax could be done more 'on account' as income is earned during the year – akin to a PAYE for businesses. This has the potential to simplify the calculation of provisional tax and create more simplicity for taxpayers. 3 .17 More use of interim accounting calculations, rather than the more difficult task of estimating the actual taxable income for the year, could better align to a business’s own processes. 3.18 This is an example where, as with other parts of this Green paper, innovation through the private sector (for example, through third-party accounting/tax software providers) could be an important ingredient in ensuring that any potential changes are successful. 3.19 The review could consider whether accounting profits with a very few key adjustments (for example, reversing out capital gains and losses and excluding non-taxable income etc.) could effectively be used as a proxy for provisional tax in practice. As noted above, accounting software packages would likely have a key role to play in developing options in this area. 3.20 Another potential proxy that could be investigated, at least for some taxpayers (such as SMEs), would be to develop a simplified system whereby provisional tax payments are based on a percentage of a business’s turnover. Systems improvements could potentially allow for a bespoke provisional tax rate to be calculated based on a business’s previous tax position. Use-of-money interest and penalties 3. 21 Issues relating to UOMI and penalties are inevitably closely related to provisional tax concerns. The following paragraphs discuss specific areas of focus that are likely to form part of the review of provisional tax. 3.22 Currently, individuals using the standard uplift method for calculating their provisional tax obligations are not subject to UOMI if their residual income tax is less than $50,000 (referred to as safe harbour taxpayers). This only applies to individuals at present, not to other entities. Options for change to safe harbour limits that could be considered include: • providing safe harbour for taxpayers using new payment calculations (as discussed above) – for example, for certain businesses using such calculations on approved software; and/or • increasing the existing monetary threshold ($50,000) for those using the standard uplift option. It should be noted that this change, in isolation, would merely take more individuals into the safe harbour limits, not other business entities; and/or • in order to bring other businesses into the safe harbour net, the safe harbour limits could also be extended so that they also apply to non-individuals when using the standard uplift method. This would mean that entities with residual income tax of less than $50,000 (or some other criteria) would no longer be subject to UOMI throughout the year. 55 3.23 Another option could be to look at the current standard uplift methods available to taxpayers more generally – for example, a review of a combination of uplift rates, safe harbour limits and payment dates. 3.24 UOMI rates could be re-considered, in particular in relation to overpayments of tax (the current rate of interest for overpayments is 1.75%). One of the reasons customers spend a lot of time on their provisional tax calculation may be because they do not want to overpay and receive a perceived low interest rate if they pay more than is required. Increased use of tax pooling 3.25 Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool their provisional tax payments in order to arbitrage better rates than standard rates of UOMI provide. A review of provisional tax would also therefore investigate whether changes could be made to the tax pooling rules to see if they can be improved and/or made available to more taxpayers in practice. Terminal tax 3.26 Any residual issues relating to terminal tax could be addressed by rolling outstanding tax liabilities into future provisional tax payments, rather than by separate one-off payments. ‘Tax bank’ / tax accounts 3.27 Some individuals or businesses might want to make regular tax payments, or to put money aside as they earn income, to make sure they have sufficient to meet future tax liablilites. 3.28 A potential area for investigation is whether there should be some sort of organised 'tax bank' – in effect, a tax account where taxpayers could make regular deposits that would be held on account to meet tax obligations as they arise. 3.29 Timing and perceived ownership would be important factors in this process. Where tax is regularly provisioned and settled with Inland Revenue, this would most likely promote compliance. However, if tax is regularly provisioned, but the money sits in the account for an extended period, customers would likely perceive the funds as belonging to them. This would likely lead to decreases in compliance as customers would perceive the funds as being available for other purposes. 3.30 A product of this nature would not necessarily need to be managed by Inland Revenue – it could instead be managed by appropriate third parties. This could potentially allow businesses and intermediaries to innovate an efficient solution to meet market needs. MICRO AND SMALL BUSINESSES 3. 31 Given the large number of small and micro businesses in New Zealand, and the fact that this sector bears a large proportion of overall compliance costs, making tax easier for this group is a real priority. Compliance costs are also higher for smaller businesses compared with larger businesses which tend to have better tax understanding, better financial systems and better business processes. Current problems 3.32 Many small businesses have poor financial systems and business processes which affect their ability to meet their tax obligations. Poor business systems are one of the causes of the following compliance problems with small business taxpayers: • under-reported income; • errors (for example, incorrect classification of capital expenditure, claiming private expenditure as business expenditure, or failure to make trading stock adjustments); and • failure to register for tax types, file tax returns, and make tax payments on time. 56 3.33 Public feedback from the Tax Administration for the 21 st Century conference indicated there are opportunities for Inland Revenue to be more proactive, sophisticated and agile in how future business tax and advice is provided to these businesses to get it right from the very start of their business operations. 3.34 It is important that taxes are not a minefield for small businesses – complying should be easy. It may be that there is assistance that Inland Revenue could provide to specifically help achieve this, including encouraging the use of improved business systems and accounting software that meets specific standards to ensure the first few years of a business’s lifecycle are successful. 3.35 Other forms of assistance could involve ensuring that the right support is available at key events that may result in tax obligations, such as taking on new staff for the first time. 3.36 Ensuring that businesses get it right first time and maintaining that level of compliance will be a focus of any on-going changes in this area. Objectives 3.37 The overarching objective of any changes to the tax rules for small and micro businesses should be to improve compliance levels, reduce compliance costs, and encourage improved business systems, while maintaining the Government’s revenue from this sector. 3.38 The following objectives should also be taken into account: • using customers' normal business processes and systems to meet tax obligations and lower their compliance burden; • making it easy for small business customers to comply, and difficult not to; • improving predictability for micro and small business customers; and • reducing the following compliance issues for small and micro businesses: • under-reported income; • errors; and • failure to file tax returns and pay on time. Initial options for consideration 3.39 In addition to general efforts to improve compliance and reduce the time and effort required of small and micro businesses to deal with their tax affairs, a specific option that could be explored further is encouraging small businesses to use accounting software that meets Inland Revenue standards. 3.40 Small businesses are very diverse and feature a range of different business models, so any such software would need to capture a number of different transactions and systems. 3.41 The type of software envisaged would capture transactions from the customer's business and automatically transfer these to the customer's accounting records and tax return. The software would have features to help users correctly classify transactions. For new micro and small businesses these features should allow them to meet their tax obligations correctly from the very start of their business operations. 3.42 Businesses that use the software would benefit from greater certainty as the types of difficulties they currently face from errors and misclassification would be reduced. This would: • reduce the level of under-reporting by automatically capturing transactions; • reduce the number of errors by assisting customers to classify transactions; • increase filing on time through automated processes; and 57 • reduce customer effort by aligning with their normal business processes. 3.43 This option could be supported by changes to the penalties rules. The current penalties rules are based on associated shortfalls arising from individual transactions. Where appropriate, the rules could be adjusted to instead focus more on the processes and systems of the customer, thus encouraging customers to remedy systems faults which give rise to tax shortfalls. 3.44 This option would also further enable Inland Revenue to focus its top-end interactions (investigations etc.) away from post-return audits on individual businesses towards greater focus on systemic issues within high-risk sectors or industries. 3.45 Small business may also benefit from tax rules being simplified. By ‘simplified’ the Government does not mean introducing tax concessions for small businesses. Tax breaks for a particular group or industry are likely to create distortions by encouraging resources to flow into less productive activities, solely to get the tax break. This is inconsistent with the BBLR framework previously discussed in Appendix 1. 3.46 However, it may be possible to make some changes that result in tax simplification for small businesses that reduce compliance costs and make it easy to comply without a substantial fiscal impact. INFORMATION PROVISION 3.47 The provision of information from businesses to Inland Revenue currently focuses on a detailed one size fits all tax return and associated disclosures. This Green paper explores placing more focus on instead providing key information, in a digital form, in a way that suits the size and nature of individual businesses, and the government. Current problems 3.48 Currently, a tax return is based on the provision of a paper 'return'. These typically have three main purposes: • providing updated factual information (for example, address and other contact information); • providing information to support decision making – such as information for policy or audit targeting; and • providing the final top-level calculations of a taxpayer’s tax liability, for checking by Inland Revenue. 3.49 Physical tax returns, in particular for businesses, is out-dated in a digital world. It does not add value to either Inland Revenue or businesses. 3.50 Businesses are often forced to duplicate processes in order to comply with return requirements. This increases compliance costs and can cause errors in transposing information from one form to another. The information required may also be out of synch with the business’s size or risk profile. 3. 51 On the other hand, from Inland Revenue’s perspective, current tax returns may not be providing the type of information from businesses that would most effectively allow it to carry out its debt recovery and audit functions. There is also an efficiency cost to Inland Revenue in processing non-digital and/or superfluous information. Potential changes 3.52 Digital technology provides an opportunity to rationalise current tax returns for non-individual entities more efficiently where the focus is on providing relevant up-to-date information in an efficient manner. 3.53 The focus of any such shift should be to best utilise businesses’ existing processes and systems to make it easier for businesses to provide their information to Inland Revenue. 3.54 Further, the focus on information provided should be more focussed on information that is necessary to support Inland Revenue in higher value matters – such as helping improve customers’ compliance, better targeting of audit activities, informed policy advice, risk evaluation, and pre- population of income for other taxpayers. 58 3.55 Introducing a differential reporting approach to the company income tax return would also reduce the reporting requirements for the majority of non-individual entities, and would be in line with recent changes to financial reporting requirements. Smaller businesses, which often have disproportionately high compliance costs, would ideally have to produce significantly less information. 3.56 Finally, any review should also ensure that: • information received from, or in relation to, new businesses starting up is fit-for-purpose and received in a timely fashion; • the rules around when binding rulings can be provided (for example, as part of the assessment process) are also fit-for- purpose. 59 WITHHOLDING TAXES ON CAPITAL INCOME APPENDIX 4 4 .1 As income from savings and investments is likely to grow in the future – as the population ages and more capital is accumulated – it will become more important to ensure that such sources of income, and associated resident withholding tax (RWT) deducted at source, are accurately and promptly recorded. 4.2 A review of the current RWT rules and practices is planned follow and build on improvements arising from more effective and streamlined collection of PAYE information. This would look to enhance the provision of information relating to, primarily, RWT arising from interest and dividends. This would be achieved by integration with existing business processes (similar to the process envisaged for an improved PAYE information-gathering process). CURRENT PROBLEMS 4.3 Where applicable, Inland Revenue currently receives information from financial institutions on RWT on an annual basis. There are, however, problems with the way this information is received and used: • Annual RWT systems are often slow, and often inaccurate, meaning further information and subsequent square-ups from customers are frequently required. • Administration and compliance costs are high, in particular in relation to the benefits realised. • There is duplication of compliance from entities recording and deducting RWT, customers and Inland Revenue. • RWT systems cannot be used as effective debt recovery tools. 4.4 In relation to dividends, Inland Revenue does not currently receive timely or effective information on dividends payments that are made. 4.5 For interest received, taxpayers can select the RWT rate they believe their interest should be taxed at. When a clearly incorrect tax rate is chosen (for example, one that is not at the margins), this will often result in tax being underpaid (or overpaid), leading to difficulties and extra compliance for customers to make up the shortfall or otherwise rectify. 4.6 Alternatively, issues can also arise in correctly identifying income from joint accounts or sources. POTENTIAL CHANGES Objectives 4.7 The fact that Inland Revenue does not have good information on capital income, or alternatively does not receive or use it in a timely manner, means it is not able to assist taxpayers in assessing their tax rate or completing their income tax returns (if required). Improvements in the way that RWT operates should help facilitate wider changes to the ways Inland Revenue interacts with individual customers (see Appendix 5). 4.8 However, effective collaboration with financial institutions and other businesses deducting RWT will be essential to ensure that any RWT changes are successful and, in particular, to ensure that overall compliance costs are efficiently managed. This means: • Information should ideally be processed automatically as part of existing business systems, for example, when payments are made (or another suitable time), rather than as part of a separate return. The information then becomes an integral part of the business system, rather than a separate process. • Business systems should interact directly with Inland Revenue (and vice versa), with up-front validation of information. • Upfront validation of information could ensure that the correct amount of tax is paid throughout the year. This could in turn reduce the number of customers who have tax to pay at a later stage. 60 • Upfront validation would also potentially allow RWT systems to be used as an efficient method of collecting underpayments of tax. • Inland Revenue would be able to use the information to pre-populate 'tax returns' to inform details of customers’ gross income and tax withheld (and social policy entitlements). Likely scope of review 4.9 This review would look at: • The timeliness of information provided to Inland Revenue – could information be provided at the time income from capital is made or soon after the year-end, rather than later or not at all. • The type of information provided (for example, should Inland Revenue receive information on capital balances)? • How the requirement to provide information could be incorporated into normal business practices, thereby reducing compliance costs. • Whether information could be validated when received by Inland Revenue. This would allow for proactive advice that a different tax code might be more appropriate. • Whether RWT systems could be used as a debt recovery tools, for example, by using variable withholding rates. • Whether changes could remove the need for financial institutions to provide annual tax information to customers, as they would already be provided directly to Inland Revenue. • The compliance cost burden that would be faced by financial institutions and businesses deducting RWT. • What alternative processes could be put into place for businesses that cannot incorporate real-time information provision into their normal business practices. 4 .10 Consultation with financial institutions and other businesses deducting RWT will be essential to ensure that any RWT changes are successful. In particular, consideration should be given to institutions that may also be subject to other changing information requirements (for example, in relation to the OECD’s Automatic Exchange of Information proposals) who will need to consider the timing and impact of the changes. 4 .11 The review should also consider the potential application of withholding tax on other sources and forms of capital income – for example, on approved issuer levies, Māori Authority distributions, portfolio investment income and royalty payments. 61 INDIVIDUALS 5.1 In terms of sequencing, there is a heavy interdependency on improving and enhancing the withholding tax mechanisms noted in Appendices 2 and 4. Changes to the way these operate are necessary to achieve a critical mass of accurate information that covers the majority of individuals taxed in New Zealand. 5.2 The current New Zealand tax administration system generally works well for individual customers whose income is derived solely from salary and wages which are subject to tax withholding regimes. It works less well where tax on investment income is either not withheld or withheld at an incorrect rate. 5.3 The current filing obligations on individual customers vary, based on historic and sometimes apparently arbitrary distinctions. This can result in customers being genuinely unaware they even have an obligation. There is a tension inherent in the tax administration system between customers who are not required to file, those who are, and those that choose to do so. 5.4 This adds complexity in meeting obligations and creates fairness and equity concerns for some individuals. A customer who is required to file a tax return might have an underpayment in one year and receive a refund in another year. For customers who are not required to file, however, there is no incentive to square-up in years of underpayments, but they can easily claim any available refunds. 5.5 Policy makers have attempted to minimise incentives for these customers to 'cherry pick' and file only when they have overpaid tax. Customers have, in effect, been forced into a gamble – if they enquire about their tax affairs by requesting a Personal Tax Summary (PTS), they are treated as filing even if this leads to a tax liability. This system, however, has led to firms offering a service to determine details of an individual’s tax affairs before requesting a PTS to remove this gamble. 5.6 This compares with those who have other forms of business income (for example, rental income) or overseas income who are required to file. These taxpayers do not get the opportunity to 'cherry pick'. APPENDIX 5 5.7 There are now growing numbers of customers who are filing returns, or otherwise interacting with Inland Revenue. Examples include individuals filing a donations rebate form or those that have in excess of $200 of interest or dividends. Likewise, Inland Revenue’s growing involvement in the delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits, has also substantially increased the number of customers who file or interact with the Department. 5.8 The following graph, which shows the increasing number of individuals filing income tax returns or PTSs from the years 2000 to 2012, illustrates this point. In the year 2000, 50% of individual taxpayers were either required to or chose to file an income tax return. By 2012 this number had increased to 62% of individuals, an increase o f 12 % .

For example, the income earned from investments in portfolio investments entities (PIEs) is taxed at the PIE rate rather than in the hands of the PIE investors. The rules are very complex because of the need to ensure that investors are taxed on their portion of the PIE income at a rate that approximates their own personal tax rate. Similar policy compromises arise when individuals earn superannuation which is subject to ESCT. 5.10 Such complexities can make it difficult for customers to understand what rates should apply to their circumstances, making it difficult for them to accurately comply with their requirements. 5 .11 As highlighted above, all of this has led to significant numbers of people being required to file. As well as those who know they have to file tax returns – for example, those earning foreign income, rental income or business income, or who are receiving Working for Families tax credits – there are others who may not know they have to. This includes people who have interest or dividend income, or an extra pay or secondary earnings on which tax has been withheld at the wrong rate. 5.12 The current problems with individuals’ current filing requirements include: • policies that can sometimes create artificial and unclear boundaries; • the fact that the system works well for individuals with one source of income, but less so if there are multiple sources of income; • customers 'cherry picking' refunds, without the requirement to always pay outstanding tax, leading to fairness and equity concerns; • the fact that the current system is not efficient in managing small debts; • high administration and compliance costs for Inland Revenue, customers and third-parties; and • Inland Revenue pre-populating some, but not all, information for individuals (for example salary and wages information, but not interest). In addition to inefficiencies, lack of visibility of information means customers can be unaware of mistakes or evasion occurring (for example, by their employer). 5.13 As previously noted, increasing numbers of customers are now interacting with Inland Revenue. Common areas where multiple interactions are occurring between Inland Revenue and customers include filing income tax returns, requesting personal tax summaries and donation rebates, Working for Families tax credits, Student Loans repayments, and Child Support issues. Customers currently can have these multiple interactions with Inland Revenue for various products dealt with separately – there is scope to have at least some of these issues considered together. POTENTIAL CHANGES Objectives 5.14 The direction outlined in this Green paper for individuals is premised on the following framework – it should: • reduce effort and provide a high level of uniform outcome for customers; • provide for a low cost of contact for all parties, including Inland Revenue, individuals and third parties (for example, employers); • be designed for a digital world; • realise the full potential of all information sources, whether these are generated internally (for example, cross-referencing information from other related tax returns) or externally (for example, from information arising in the future from automatic exchange of information agreements); 63 • provide for one process that applies for all individual taxpayers, regardless of different information requirements; • be flexible to allow for future changes (for example, the introduction of new tax bases or new forms of technology); • pre-populate as much information as possible (in a timely manner), and prompt for information which cannot be pre-populated; • efficiently allow for the recovery of underpayments through the use of variable withholding rates; and • make effective use of on-going analytics and risk assessment tools to deliver a better service to customers. Initial option for consultation 5.15 One option for consideration could be for all customers to interact at some level with Inland Revenue, albeit in a much easier form than currently. 5.16 The potential changes discussed in this Green paper envisage an electronic filing system that is pre-populated by timely and accurate withholding systems. The majority of customers would then, as a maximum, only be required to check and confirm their details and, where applicable, report unlisted income such as overseas income or income where there is no deduction at source (for example, rental income). In most cases, square-up amounts of tax would be dealt with by either refunds being automatically released or debts paid by automatically adjusting withholding rates on future income sources. 5 .17 In short, the focus would be on making “filing” simpler and less onerous for individuals’ tax obligations using pre- population and better technology to automatically adjust withholding rates to collect prior underpayments of tax. 5.18 This could be facilitated, in part, by a personalised web page showing: • known income; • other sources of taxable income, such as PIE income; • prompts based on third-party data and/or previously provided information; • a tax liability calculated by Inland Revenue and confirmed by the taxpayer; and • a digital notification of the resulting tax position. 5.19 The key benefits potentially arising would include: • greater fairness and transparency; • potential simplification of regimes such as the PIE rules; • improved automation of debt collection; • flexibility for dealing with future policy changes, and future opportunities to support all-of-government outcomes; • administration efficiencies (for example, less 'exception' processing) and lower compliance burden for taxpayers over time; and • better use of information and data across government (both internationally and domestically). 5.20 The change in focus towards providing data also allows a move away from concepts like 'filing' and 'returns', and enables associated information to be consolidated (for example, charitable rebates can be dealt together with income tax rather than as a separate form). From a customer perspective, it would also allow individuals to understand what their obligations are and how the wider tax system works, which would support compliance over time. 64 SOCIAL POLICY 6 .1 Inland Revenue administers a number of social policies, either directly or on behalf of other agencies. The social policy areas primarily considered as part of this Green paper are: • Working for Families tax credits; and • Child Support. 6.2 Some of the potential changes discussed may, however, also affect Paid Parental Leave, Student Loan repayments and KiwiSaver. 6.3 Currently, social policies administered by Inland Revenue generally operate within the tax system. This has sometimes resulted in changes being made to social policy settings to ensure they fit within existing tax system parameters. An example of this is having annual return cycles for social policies linked to the tax year (for example, having annual entitlements from 1 April). These can sometimes limit potential policy outcomes and customer experiences. 6.4 Although many social policies use household income as a base for entitlement, other non-income information is also often brought into account when calculating entitlements. 6.5 This can take a number of forms – for example, living arrangements and family size are often taken into account, as are other sources of income that may not be included as income for individual income tax purposes. CURRENT PROBLEMS 6.6 Some Working for Families and Child Support customers will go into debt, or are already in debt, due to out-of-date information held about an individual or family. Others are receiving less than they are entitled to during the year, with payments instead being made late or not at all. 6.7 This clearly affects their overall well-being and may have a negative effect on their families, work incentives and economic situation. 6.8 This debt (or underpayment) tends to arise from having an annual assessment period, but requiring payments to be made in advance or concurrently with the assessment entitlement. Such a system requires an upfront estimate together with an end-of-period square-up, with a requirement for changes of circumstances to be notified during the year. 6.9 The alternative to estimates is using verified information. This usually means income or circumstances from 1 or 2 years prior. For many people this information is out of date and may no longer be relevant. For people who do have changing circumstances, this approach often produces inaccurate results. 6 .10 Even if information is correct at the beginning of the year, changes in individuals’ circumstances are often required during the year, necessitating contact to be made between individuals and Inland Revenue, often several times a year. 6 .11 However, the current rules often provide little incentive for a customer to initiate that contact, particularly if it would result in a reduction in payments received. Ultimately, this frequently results in square-ups being required, again causing year-end debt, and penalties. 6 .12 Social policy entitlements are generally based on the combined circumstances of the parents (whether together or separated) and their dependent children. This is at odds with the overall tax system which focuses on the individual taxpayer with secrecy provisions in place to prevent information being shared with other family members. The result is often higher compliance and administration costs. If this results in people not taking up the assistance (or complying with obligations), it could have a detrimental effect on the social policy outcome the Government wishes to achieve as well as affect the families directly. 6 .13 While the social policies have common features (for example, the support of children) they operate as separate products, requiring duplication and additional contacts. They can also develop and evolve differently over time, leading to complex interactions for families who are subject to more than one set of rules. APPENDIX 6 65 OBJECTIVES 6 .14 The intent is to design a process that works for the customer and is fit for purpose. It should match the timeliness of payments to the need to receive (or ability to pay) on a real-time basis. 6 .15 Key objectives for any change should be: • to make it as easy as possible for people to: • understand; • comply on time; and/or • receive their correct entitlements in a timely manner • to provide a reasonable level of certainty for individuals and families (for example, to help with budgeting); • to minimise an individual’s debt, and assist recovery of any overpayments arising; • to provide sufficient information so that key policy and operational concerns can be identified easily and resolved quickly; • to provide value-for-money for the government; • to allow for cross-agency interaction and outcomes; and • to be adaptable, flexible and scalable to cater for future changes. 6 .16 It is likely that future changes would have the following characteristics: • a low cost of contact; • be designed for a digital world, but allow for multiple customer channels; • be designed for the family household rather than just the individual members; and • cater for multiple changes in members of a household over time. LIKELY SCOPE OF REVIEW 6 .17 The scope of the review on Inland Revenue’s social policy administration is likely to be wide and varied, and will likely include the following general issues: • reconsidering the annual approach often taken for social policies administered by Inland Revenue (for example, for Working for Families tax credits); • making greater use of information and services from other sources (including other government agencies) as a trigger that a customer’s circumstances may have changed; • consideration of ways to encourage more frequent contact from customers – as this allows for a better reflection of real-life circumstances; • allowing for more frequent contact, facilitated by advances in technology that allow for easy, more active, low-cost interaction; • looking at other ways of minimising debt, and consideration of whether debt recovery could, in some circumstances in the future, be offset against future entitlement payments; • potential greater alignment of definitions and rules across various social policy services; • whether a different, low-cost approach could be taken for families with simple arrangements and minimal changes in circumstances; and • how best to administer unique or complex family situations. 6 .18 Some of the more fundamental issues that will likely form a significant part of the scope of the review of Inland Revenue’s social policy administration are considered 66 briefly below. Given their linkages and dependencies, these will likely be considered after potential changes to withholding taxes and individuals’ taxation have been explored further. Time periods 6 .19 Any change to the annual cycle would be a fundamental change to the way social policy is administered by Inland Revenue, having a big impact on both individuals and Inland Revenue. 6.20 The scope of this review will assess whether changing periods is feasible and sustainable. It will cover issues such as: • Period of assessment: looking at what the best period of assessment for families/individuals for social policies is, covering criteria such as residency, age, family status, relationships, employment status and income. Should it be annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily? • Period of payment: consideration of whether arrears, current periods or prospective periods, should form the basis for making payments. Alignment of payment period options between Working for Families, Child Support and Paid Parental leave should also be considered (currently some are paid weekly, others fortnightly or monthly). • Period of income measured: looking at whether current, future or prior period income should form the basis for measuring income. The need for estimates and subsequent square-ups (or otherwise) will be a key factor here. 6. 21 There will be advantages and disadvantages in each of these considerations. For example, on the face of it, a shorter period of assessment may intuitively seem more appropriate for many social policies as it may better mirror changing family circumstances. On the other hand, such an approach can help some people to try and structure, their affairs to arrange outcomes for their own purposes. Debt prevention and collection 6.22 The scope of the review on debt prevention and collection will likely cover, as a minimum, the following issues and considerations: • Removal of an annual terminal assessment and subsequent debt collection approach for Working for Families, replaced by a system based on on-going accumulative adjustments taking into account changing circumstances. Under such a system, any over-or under- payments are adjusted for in later payments with a final square-up only at the end of entitlement. Debt would then only arise when entitlement ends, and then on a smaller scale. • Reducing interim entitlements for Working for Families, resulting only in end-of-year payments and not debt. • Reviewing penalty rules, debt collection and write-off rules to see if any changes can be made that better reflect the social policy environment. • Improving upfront debt prevention by reviewing rules such as those backdating requirements to pay, payments in advance of eligibility confirmation, and use of default assessments where information is lacking. Better alignment of definitions and rules 6.23 As part of the wider Government review of social policy administration, it is likely that a review will be conducted of all common definitions and rules across different social policy elements. This will help to determine whether there are valid reasons for variations or, if not, to determine what the default setting should be across these policies. 6.24 This review could indicate if it would be helpful to have a simplified policy and legislative system that covers the large majority of families and circumstances supplemented by a special delegated arrangement to address unique or complex situations. 67 THE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION 7.1 Changes to the way customers interact with Inland Revenue provides an opportunity to investigate the fundamental issues contained within the primary legislative vehicle for tax administration, the Tax Administration Act 19 9 4. 7. 2 In considering specific enabling legislation that would be required for any particular change as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme, a policy review of key tax administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of our tax administration system is needed. 7. 3 This review will involve consideration of: • the roles of Parliament and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in tax administration; • the role of customers and third parties in the transformed administration and the implications for current obligations and sanctions; • principles underpinning information and secrecy; and • the legislative structure of the Inland Revenue Acts. 7. 4 This Green paper does not seek to address these issues at this time, but rather raises awareness that these issues will be considered at an early stage in the business transformation programme. ROLES OF PARLIAMENT AND THE COMMISSIONER Role of Parliament 7. 5 Parliament both guides and constrains the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and the relationship between the Commissioner and taxpayers. 7. 6 The first point to note is that the power to levy tax belongs to Parliament alone. Parliament also prescribes the tax laws on what the Commissioner and the taxpayer must do to discharge their respective tax administration and tax compliance functions. 7. 7 It is accepted that legislative prescription is necessary to ensure certainty in the rules and to retain a perception by taxpayers of impartiality by the Commissioner. It is for Parliament to determine how much prescription (versus Commissioner administrative decision-making) is desirable for these purposes. Role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue 7. 8 To a reasonable extent the role of the Commissioner is clear and adequately expressed in the Tax Administration Act. 'Care and management' is a key component of this and works well as a mechanism to reflect that the Commissioner needs to apply his/her limited resources effectively and efficiently. However, there are some areas in which the Commissioner’s role could be reviewed. 7. 9 The areas for consideration include: • how 'care and management' applies in the context of the responsibilities in the Inland Revenue Acts that are not about core tax matters; and • whether the Commissioner should be provided with greater discretion or flexibility so that resources of both the Commissioner and taxpayer are not unduly tied up in outcomes that are impractical to apply and are inconsistent with clear policy intent. ROLE OF TAXPAYERS AND THIRD-PARTIES 7.10 Self-assessment is a feature of the current New Zealand tax administration rules, and provides an efficient basis for tax collection. While definitions of the term may vary, self-assessment fundamentally reflects the fact that, traditionally, a taxpayer has the information and has often been in the best position to determine their own income and tax liability. 7.11 It can be assumed that taxpayers will still be in the best position to verify the accuracy and completeness of their own income or circumstances. However, it will be important to test this assumption and carefully consider the full implications of any changes concerning the roles APPENDIX 7 68 and obligations of taxpayers. An understanding of taxpayer obligations is core to the compliance and penalties legislation. Any changes to these obligations could have implications for the penalty rules. 7.12 Self-assessment shapes the dispute resolution procedures, binding rulings regime and other key features of the current tax administration framework. A review of these policy and legislative settings needs to be considered in the context of any changes to the self-assessment framework. INFORMATION AND SECRECY 7.13 Inland Revenue is a highly information-driven government agency and has more interactions with New Zealanders than any other agency. Information flows and analytics will be increasingly critical to its ability to perform its core functions effectively in the future. Likewise, the ability of Inland Revenue to assist in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government more widely, by working with other agencies and organisations, is dependent on timely and accurate information. 7.14 As the Government's modernisation programme is developed, various key questions will need to be asked and considered. These include: • Where will core information that is required come from (for example, taxpayers, employers, financial institutions, other third parties)? • What other information might Inland Revenue need to share, and with whom would it be shared? • To what extent should Inland Revenue collect information on behalf of other government agencies (that it can collect easily) that may not necessarily be required for tax or social policy purposes? The secrecy rules 7.15 The effective administration of the New Zealand tax system relies on the voluntary compliance of customers. Critical to this compliance is customers having trust in Inland Revenue that their information will not be disclosed inappropriately. However, to operate the tax system efficiently, Inland Revenue sometimes needs to disclose information to third parties when it is reasonable to do so. An appropriate balance is needed when these principles are inconsistent. 7.16 Provisions protecting customer confidentiality have been in place for over 100 years. The secrecy rules in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act provide a strict rule of secrecy for Inland Revenue officers, subject to a number of specific and general exemptions. 7.17 Other pieces of legislation are relevant to information collection, use and disclosure. The Privacy Act sets out information privacy principles relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, and contains specific frameworks for the sharing of personal information by government agencies. Information sharing 7.18 In 2013 new rules were put into place in the Privacy Act permitting and governing 'approved information sharing agreements' (AISAs) between agencies delivering public services. A specific exception to the general secrecy rules allows Inland Revenue to share certain information under an AISA. This framework applies to 'personal information about an identifiable individual' and does not cover all taxpayer-specific information held by Inland Revenue. A broader consideration of information sharing in the cross- agency setting, and if appropriate beyond, may therefore be warranted. Issues to consider 7.19 The ideas discussed in this Green paper aim for the more effective use of information within Inland Revenue and greater cooperation across government to, where appropriate, increase efficiencies. These goals will involve consideration of how Inland Revenue obtains, uses and releases the information it holds, and whether the current legislative framework is fit for purpose. 69 7. 2 0 A number of potential inconsistencies and tensions will therefore be considered as part of on-going policy considerations, such as: • the interplay between information sharing and tax secrecy, and any potential implications for the integrity of the tax system; • whether non-customer-specific information (for example, statistical information or organisational information) should be treated differently from customer-specific information; • whether information for social policy purposes (which relates to family circumstances) should be treated differently to an individual’s tax information; • intelligence sharing and participation in cross-agency initiatives – i.e. whether Inland Revenue should have the ability to collect more data than it strictly requires if associated information is required for wider government requirements (for example, numbers of hours worked)? • sharing of information both generally (with reference to the AISA framework), and in particular about non-individuals (i.e. those not covered by the AISA framework, such as businesses); • potential co-location and joint service provision with other government agencies; • the implications of greater provision of information via business accounting software and/or intermediaries; • how best to source information that will enable Inland Revenue to identify and assist customers to get it ‘right from the start’; and • how to manage the collection and use of large external data sets. LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE 7. 21 Inland Revenue’s functions now include administering a wide portfolio of major social policy functions (Working for Families, Student Loans, Child Support and KiwiSaver). This is reflected in the legislation, collectively known as the Inland Revenue Acts, that Inland Revenue administers. Determining the purpose of the Tax Administration Act in relation to the Inland Revenue Acts will be critical to ensuring the Tax Administration Act has a logical and coherent structure. 7. 2 2 Specific business transformation work streams will necessitate particular changes to the Tax Administration Act. Changes to the Tax Administration Act will give rise to a significant level of legislative redrafting. As a result, certain provisions will become obsolete. A starting point for a new Tax Administration Act could be to re-order provisions, including ones that can sensibly be carried over from other Inland Revenue Acts.
We’d like to get your views on possible changes that could make it simpler and faster for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. MAKING TAX SIMPLER Whether you are paying tax, receiving payments such as Working for Families or benefiting from government expenditure on health, education or welfare you have an interest in the tax system working well. With so many interactions happening every day, it’s vital that these interactions are as simple as possible and the tax system is as efficient as possible. The Government wants to ensure that the way we administer tax works for you and will continue to do so in the future. We need to modernise tax administration and reduce the costs of dealing with it. We think this will benefit everyone, and our economy. For example: • Businesses should benefit from improvements to the PAYE rules and processes to make providing PAYE, GST and related information less time consuming. • Simplification of the provisional tax rules to more easily allow payment as income is earned, should also benefit businesses. • Changes to the way income information is collected would allow you to have an online form already filled in for you. You would be able to quickly and easily self-manage your tax affairs online. All you would do is confirm the details. And you’d get any refunds quicker. • A tax system which uses technology in a smarter way will make it easier for people to comply with their tax obligations, and hard for them not to. This is important to ensure our current tax settings are delivering all the revenue they should and that everyone is paying their share. • The economy would benefit from a tax administration that costs less to run. Making the tax system more efficient will mean money can be spent where we benefit most, such as on health care or schools. WHAT’S YOUR VIEW? Over the next few years, you will see detailed proposals outlining specific ideas for you to consider. Right now, we need to know what you think of the overall direction sketched out here. Is this the correct path to take? Has anything important been left out?

We hope you will take some time to consider them for yourself. GREEN PAPER ON TAX ADMINISTRATION Hon Bill English MINISTER OF FINANCE Hon Todd McClay MINISTER OF REVENUE makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz THE THINKING SO FAR . . . Detailed proposals will be made public over the next few years. However the Government would like to hear your views on the overall direction described below and whether we are focused on the right things before more work is done. Business All employers must deduct tax and ACC levies for each employee each payday. Employers must also send PAYE information to Inland Revenue using Employer Monthly Schedules. The process is labour-intensive, time consuming and often inaccurate. Many businesses also find the provisional tax rules onerous. The Government is considering possible improvements to simplify tax for businesses by: • Streamling the collection and calculation of PAYE, GST and related information by integrating these obligations into business processes. • Using existing business processes and technology to calculate provisional tax. • Helping smaller businesses get their tax affairs and systems correct right from the start. • Reviewing withholding tax rules. Details of these and other proposals to make tax simpler for business will be released for your feedback later this year and in 2016. Withholding tax on investment income It is important that the system is fair and all contribute. Part of this is ensuring dividend and interest income is shown on online forms and is correctly taxed. Changes here are also necessary to enable individual tax interactions to be simplified. Detailed proposals will be released for your feedback in 2016. Individuals Some people currently file income tax returns if they have income other than from wages or salary. For those who don’t, there is a question of the accuracy of the tax calculated and deducted from their pay. The Government is considering possible improvements to simplify this by: • Providing an online return already filled out with all your known income information. All you would need to do is confirm that it is a complete list of your income, and if it is not, add the extra income. • More effective use of technology to make it easier for people to manage both overpayments (refunds) and underpayments (debts) of tax. Detailed proposals on these and other proposals will be released for your feedback in 2016. Social Policy Examples of social policy administered by Inland Revenue include Working for Families and Child Support. Both of these are important parts of supporting New Zealand families. If Inland Revenue’s information about an individual or family is out of date some people can go into debt. The Government is suggesting that the system should use current information to make more accurate payments. This would help prevent people going into debt. Details of these and other proposals to simplify tax for individuals will be released for your feedback in 2017.

Why? Inland Revenue collects taxes and distributes money on behalf of the Government. •Taxes pay for essential public services such as schools, hospitals, roads, social welfare and much more. •There are millions of interactions with the tax system every day. People pay tax through their wages, salaries and interest payments; businesses collect and pay GST and other taxes. •Important government services, such as Working for Families, student loans, child support and KiwiSaver are delivered by the tax administration system. •Running the tax system is expensive; for the government in running it, and for individuals and businesses complying with it. Everyone shares these costs, whether directly or indirectly. A BETTER TAX ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM The Government wants to make it simpler and faster for New Zealanders to pay the taxes and receive the entitlements they should. It is proposing changes that will create opportunities for individuals and businesses to spend less time on taxes and compliance, and more time on living their lives and growing their businesses. Technology is a key consideration for this Government. The tax administration system could improve services and reduce compliance costs for customers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. For this to happen: •Inland Revenue needs to offer a wider range of secure digital services. •It needs to work with others who deal with tax, such as banks and business software developers, so tax interactions are built into customers’ regular transactions, rather than having to manage CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW 5 tax separately at specific times of the year. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Many people and businesses are already using digital services to manage their taxes, and are enjoying the convenience, speed and simplicity. As Inland Revenue builds more and better digital services – sometimes in conjunction with third parties – more people and businesses will be able to enjoy the benefits that digital services provide. People and businesses who do not have access to digital technology, or the skills or knowledge to use it, might be able to use digital services if some help was provided. Non-digital services would continue to be provided for those who still cannot use digital services. Some people and businesses might be able to use digital services, but need encouragement. When the majority of individuals and businesses in similar circumstances are using digital services, having a few who do not use digital services can create problems. These could include: the costs in keeping a non-digital service available for a small number of users, or denying others, such as a business’s customers or employees the benefits of an improved tax administration system. This paper seeks views on how we might move these individuals and businesses to digital services. THIS IS HOW THE FUTURE COULD LOOK: Zack wants to establish an adventure tourism business. What if Zack could buy a “business in a box” accounting software package that would automatically register his new business with government, including Inland Revenue, for income tax, GST, and as an employer? ZACK: Small business Mike is 66 and retired, but still helps out at his former employer occasionally. He has reinvested his KiwiSaver funds in a range of New Zealand listed shares and bonds, and term deposits. What if Mike’s interest and dividends were already included in his online tax return? He could simply check everything was correct, and confirm and complete his return at the click of a button. MIKE: Individual Mary runs a medical supplies company with 140 staff. Ben works for the company on a casual basis when they need an extra hand. He is repaying his student loan and is entitled to Working for Families tax credits. What if Mary’s payroll software automatically sent Ben’s information to and from Inland Revenue as part of each weekly pay cycle, with his student loan repayments and Working for Families entitlement being automatically calculated and updated? Mary’s job would be much easier and Ben would no longer have money owing or a refund due at the end of each year. M ARY: Medium/Large business BEN: Individual 6 CONSULTATION TIMETABLE These proposals will need changes to the law, and system changes at Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will be communicating the changes to New Zealanders well before the introduction of any changes.

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? A key part of New Zealand’s infrastructure Taxes are by far the biggest source of government revenue. They fund schools, hospitals, roads, policing, social welfare, and other government- provided services. Because tax revenue is critical to delivering government services, and the same administrative system is used to provide many social services, the tax administration system operated by Inland Revenue is a key part of the infrastructure which supports New Zealand society. More New Zealanders interact with Inland Revenue than with any other government agency. The efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration system is important for: • everyone who interacts with Inland Revenue to meet their tax obligations or access their entitlements; • everyone who uses services provided by the New Zealand Government; and • taxpayers, who pay the system’s costs. It is big and expensive There are millions of interactions with the tax administration system every day, across the economy. These interactions include: • tax deductions from salaries, wages, and interest payments; • payments like income tax; • other amounts like student loan repayments; and • Working for Families tax credits. There are significant costs for businesses and individuals in Inland Revenue administers the delivery of tax and social policies, including: Income tax, Goods and Services tax, Gaming duties, Working for Families tax credits, paid parental leave, student loan repayments, child support and KiwiSaver. CHAPTER 2 WHY THE WAY TAX IS ADMINISTERED MATTERS 8 REVENUE COLLECTED AND PAYMENTS DISBURSED – 2013/14 meeting their tax obligations to Inland Revenue. In addition, administering the tax system cost the Government over $650 million in 2013/14 . The Government’s “Better Public Services” programme has a clear expectation of improved services to the public, and a reduction in costs in dealing with government agencies. A key consideration for this Government is how the tax administration system can use modern digital technology and connected government services to improve the customer experience and reduce compliance costs for customers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Greater levels of tax compliance – as a result of tax obligations being easier to meet, and reducing the opportunity for mistakes – is also important. $2.5b Distributed with Ministry of Social Development in entitlements to support families $1.0b in student loan repayments $56.2b Tax revenue collected by Inland Revenue $165m Paid parental leave payments to 25,836 parents $ 4 .1b Distributed to KiwiSaver scheme providers $1.1b Other revenue collected by Inland Revenue 9 Digital services are evolving fast. The internet and the mobile phone have transformed communication, business processes and our lifestyles. NEW ZEALANDERS ARE EMBRACING THE CHANGE Internet use in New Zealand households is relatively high. According to the 2013 Census, 77% of households have access to the internet. The World Internet Project's 2012 research found that New Zealanders who use the internet use it extensively: • 81% check emails at least daily; • 64% pay bills online at least monthly; and • 52% go online at least monthly to look for travel information. In a recent research led by Tufts University on digital evolution among 50 countries, New Zealand is ranked as one of the nations that have shown high levels of digital development in the past and this is expected to continue. THE GOVERNMENT’S VISION FOR NEW ZEALAND The Government recognises that digital technology can improve customers’ experience of government services and reduce the cost of providing these services for everyone. Its vision for New Zealanders is for them to be able to “complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment”. This vision includes the commitment to help customers to manage their transactions digitally, and provide alternatives for those who cannot. For business, the Government’s target is to cut the costs of dealing with government by 25% by 2017. Greater use of digital services is considered to be a key enabler in meeting that target. The Government’s intent in promoting greater use of digital services is to improve the service offered by government and not simply to shift costs from government to the private sector. WHAT DOES “DIGITAL” MEAN? Digital technology is a way to transfer, process, record, generate and display information electronically. It includes, but is not limited to, internet-enabled systems, email, text, apps, and social media. This discussion document uses “‘digital”’ as shorthand for any electronically enabled technology; in whatever form that might take today and in the future. In July 2013 the Government set ten challenging results for the public sector over the next five years. Result 9 requires the cost to business in dealing with government to reduce by 25%. Result 10 requires New Zealanders to be able to complete their transactions with the government easily in a digital environment.

This is significantly higher than the international average. Just over 32% of worldwide consumer retail spending was card-based, according to 2012 research by Moody’s Analytics. According to Statistics New Zealand, New Zealanders’ use of electronic card transaction is growing. 77% of New Zealand households have access to the internet 23% of New Zealand households do not have access to the internet PENETRATION OF INTERNET IN NEW ZEALAND HOUSEHOLDS (Statistics NZ, 2013 census) 52% of New Zealanders who use the internet go online at least monthly to look for travel information 64% of New Zealanders who use the internet pay their bills online at least monthly 52%48% 64%36% 81% of New Zealanders who use the internet check their emails daily 81%19 % THE WORLD INTERNET PROJECT (2012) REPORT FOUND THAT: 11 POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE TAX ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM The digital technology already exists to transform the way individuals, families and businesses interact with Inland Revenue (see Appendix 1: other tax jurisdictions' digital approaches). For example, digital technology could be used to: • allow customers to access services and information faster and at a time that is convenient for them, through whatever devices might be appropriate for that type of interaction; • allow customers to receive immediate confirmation that their obligation to provide information or make a payment has been discharged; • provide information already held by Inland Revenue – for example, from banks – in tax returns so businesses and individuals do not have to supply it; • share information from other government agencies so businesses and individuals do not have to supply it again; • integrate tax processes into normal “life” processes. For example, a migrant could receive an IRD number at the same time they were granted a work visa; • integrate tax interactions into business software so businesses do not have to provide information separately for their tax requirements. For example, an employer could meet their PAYE obligations as part of paying wages through payroll software; • proactively inform customers of obligations or entitlements and inform customers about services that might be useful to them; • provide a “real time” view of a customer’s tax and related social policy information; and • enable shortfall payments and debt to be collected from subsequent income periods. THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FOR NEW ZEALANDERS If digital services are secure and designed to make it easy for customers to use them, increased digital service delivery could deliver the following benefits to customers: • Greater convenience: Digital services can provide customers with the immediacy and convenience of access to information and services any time and anywhere. Interactions can take place through multiple digital channels, such as mobile, apps and through business software. • Greater speed and confidence: Responses and notifications could be delivered through digital channels in addition to those delivered now, and faster than those currently delivered. 12 • Reduction of effort: The ability to integrate with other systems and pre-populate information could reduce the effort required by customers to fulfil their tax and social policy obligations. • Improved, more rapid and responsive customer services: Digital services could make the monitoring and capturing of a customer’s experience, satisfaction and perception of the services they have received much easier, and allow Inland Revenue to improve its services. • Reducing the cost of the tax administration system: Reduced tax administration costs could allow Inland Revenue to provide better targeted services, the Government to increase spending in other areas and reduce government spending overall. Others involved in the tax administration system – such as tax agents and accountants – could focus on higher-value services such as supporting business growth rather than routine tax compliance. • Improved delivery of services across government. Some information collected by Inland Revenue is used by other government agencies – such as ACC, which uses employment information to calculate levies. Faster, more accurate information which other agencies can use could enable the delivery of better services by them to their customers, and greater efficiencies across government. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 Do you agree that the benefits set out could result from the greater use of digital services in tax administration? 2 Are there other benefits which could be gained from improving and introducing more secure digital services? 13 Inland Revenue already offers a range of digital services, including website, mobile apps, text, software-enabled filing, email, social media, and voice recognition technology. Customer satisfaction with online channels is relatively high. There is already significant use of digital services to meet tax obligations: • In December 2014, 86% of payments were made electronically. • As at 30 June 2014, 1.7 million active customers were registered for myIR, Inland Revenue’s web- based digital service channel. MyIR allows customers to update their own information and file returns digitally. Voice ID is an example of Inland Revenue’s innovative use of digital technology. Voice ID uses voice recognition technology so individuals can identify themselves at the beginning of a phone call to Inland Revenue, eliminating the need to answer personal security questions. This gives customers access to automated self-service functions even outside office hours. These examples suggest a relatively high level of willingness to adopt new digital services offered by Inland Revenue. INLAND REVENUE’S CURRENT DIGITAL SERVICES HAVE LIMITATIONS Despite positive progress, Inland Revenue’s digital services have significant limitations: • digital services are not available to cover all customer interactions; • even when digital services are available for customers, they do not always generate a positive customer experience; • they exist as stand-alone services, and are not integrated with other activities that customers carry out, such as dealing with their bank or using their business accounting software; • they do not integrate with most other government services; and Inland Revenue’s website has won the top government website eight times in the annual New Zealand NetGuide Awards. CHAPTER 4 TAX ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO CHANGE 14 2.3% Over the counter payments 11. 3 % Cheque payments 86.3% Electronic payments 95% of customers are 'satisfied' with Inland Revenue's online channel (2013-14 figures) 19 million visits were made to the Inland Revenue website (www.ird.govt.nz) in 2013-14 1. 3 million customers were registered with Voice ID by January 2015. Around 60-70 per cent of people who call IRD on any day are now enrolled with Voice ID. This means New Zealand has the high- est level of voice biometrics per capita in the world. THE MAJORITY OF PAYMENTS ARE MADE VIA DIGITAL CHANNELS The proportion of electronic payments Inland Revenue received in December 2014 was 86% which shows a 19% increase compared with December 2013. A significant contributor to this has been the removal of a previous rule which provided a timing advantage to those who paid by cheque. 15 • they do not always provide the same level of functionality as other channels. Despite high overall satisfaction with Inland Revenue’s existing digital services, in-depth research found that customers: • have difficulty accessing and using Inland Revenue information they need; • find Inland Revenue’s transactional processes time-consuming, disconnected and confusing; • regularly use multiple service delivery channels to undertake one interaction; • are uncertain whether they have done the right thing; and • are frustrated that information is not shared and is inconsistent across Inland Revenue’s different digital services. The limitations outlined above are largely a consequence of the technology used to administer the tax system. The core technology Inland Revenue operates on is 25 years old and predates most of the digital innovations that customers currently take for granted. In addition, Inland Revenue’s role has expanded from simply collecting tax in a paper-based world to managing the collection of tax and the delivery of income-related social policies such as student loan repayments, Working for Families tax credits and KiwiSaver. Adding social policy services to 25-year-old technology has resulted in an extremely complex intertwined system which is expensive, risky and time consuming to make further changes to. Inland Revenue’s ageing technology platform has also imposed significant limitations on its ability to deliver targeted services, and innovative policy approaches. Current tax legislation, including the Tax Administration Act 1994, also originated in a paper-based environment. It needs to be modernised to ensure it does not inhibit the uptake of digital services. This is further discussed in Chapter 7. GOVERNMENT HAS BEGUN THE CHANGE The Government recognises that the improvements it wants to achieve in the way businesses and individuals interact with government cannot be achieved without a fundamental redesign of the tax administration system, enabled by digital technology. The early design stage of this work has already begun, and the results of this consultation will help to shape the redesign. 16 The following discussion starts from the assumption that digital tax services will be designed and operated to be secure and reliable, and based on best practice standards. But developing and providing secure, reliable digital services does not mean that people will use them. This chapter proposes a number of principles to guide the development of digital services so that the benefits identified in Chapter 3 will be realised. OVER-ARCHING PRINCIPLE: SERVICES MUST BE DESIGNED FOR THE CUSTOMER Designing services to meet customers’ needs is critical to realising the benefits. A fundamental objective of a new tax administration system is high quality user-friendly tax services – either delivered by Inland Revenue or by a third party. Each of the following principles addresses a different aspect of this overriding principle. PRINCIPLE 1: NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL Customers vary New Zealand businesses and individuals are diverse. When developing digital services, it is important that Inland Revenue understands and reflects this diversity. Inland Revenue segments its customer base by demographic factors, such as individuals and families; small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and corporates, and the nature of the service they use, such as student loan borrowers. It also has important relationships with third parties such as tax intermediaries and software developers. Types of interaction People interact with the tax administration system for different reasons and typically have different preferences on how the interaction is handled, depending on the nature of interaction. Within a business, different people may be responsible for different interactions, and have different preferences – eg digital, telephone, in person or in writing. SMEs are usually run by a single owner or small number of individuals who do everything for their business. Research conducted for the Government indicated that many SMEs wanted to be able to interact with government outside normal business hours. Large corporates often have “bespoke” accounting systems and require considerable notice to make changes. NEW ZEALAND IS HIGHLY CONNECTED In the 2012 international comparison report by the Worldwide Internet Project, New Zealand (85.4%) was ranked as a country where access to the internet was high, along with Australia (86.8%), Sweden (85.6%) and Canada (84.1%). CHAPTER 5 SERVICES MEET ENSURING DIGITAL EVERYONE'S NEEDS 17 To meet people’s needs, it is important these preferences are understood and that customers are offered the channel of communication that best suits their needs. As far as possible, the underlying systems should be flexible enough to accommodate customer preferences and technology changes. The environment will continue to change Creating a comprehensive set of digital services at a fixed point in time will not be sufficient to ensure customers’ needs are met. Technology evolves constantly – for example, internet over mobile networks is a relatively recent innovation, and mobile eftpos terminals are even more recent. Change will also take place in business practice and in the way individuals organise their lives – in some instances as a result of technology, sometimes as a result of other factors. In order to deliver digital services which have the customer at the centre, Inland Revenue will need to constantly evaluate emerging, maturing and declining technology and activity in the business sector and the individual customer sector, consider what new needs might emerge for digital services, and what new digital services become possible. PRINCIPLE 2: TAX COMPLIANCE AND ACCESS TO ENTITLEMENTS ARE CRITICAL The tax administration system is based on voluntary compliance; the idea that customers understand what they should do and do it. For voluntary compliance to work the tax administration system needs to feel fair, relatively simple and easy so that customers feel supported in meeting their tax obligations. The tax system is also used to deliver various social policy entitlements – Working for Families tax credits, paid parental leave, and child support. It is vital that those who benefit from these entitlements are able to interact with the tax administration system. The term “digital divide” is used to describe the inequality which results from parts of the population not having access to information and communication technology. This exists in New Zealand but is relatively small in an international context. From available research, approximately 8% of the individuals surveyed did not have access to internet in 2013. Socioeconomic factors, and New Zealand’s challenging geography, which limits access to broadband in some rural areas, are factors which can prevent internet access. Inability to use digital services does not solely arise from lack of access. Even for customers who have internet access the level of digital readiness can differ. Some customers will lack the skills, knowledge or confidence to interact with government digitally. RURAL BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY The Government’s rural broadband initiative aims to connect 86% of rural homes and businesses with broadband at peak speeds of at least 5 mbps by 2016. Before the initiative began in 2011 only 20% of the rural popula- tion enjoyed access at this speed. According to Kiwis Count Survey on New Zealanders' satisfaction with public services in August 2013, the majority (83%) of New Zealanders consider that if digital access to public services was simple and user-friendly it would encourage them to use the internet to access those public services. 18 Others may prefer and trust what they know and see no reason to change. Customer inclination has been described as ranging from “innovators and early adopters” at one end to “laggards” at the other. While research suggests that good customer-centred design is the most important factor in determining uptake, support and assistance for customers must be part of any future services design. The Government is committed to ensuring that modernising the tax administration system will also help voluntary compliance and people’s ability to access their social policy entitlements. It is critical that the introduction of digital services does not result in some people who comply with their tax obligations now not complying in the future, or make it more difficult for people to access their social policy entitlements. Because these objectives are key, where necessary assistance will be provided to help people to access digital services, and if they are unable to use a digital service they will not be prevented from complying with their tax obligations or accessing their social policy entitlements. Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical Changes will not be imposed with out careful consider- ation of the costs and benefits C U S T O M E R S V A R Y I N T E R A C T I O N S V A R Y No one size fits all Services must be designed with customers at the centre MEETING CUSTOMERS' NEEDS 19 PRINCIPLE 3: CHANGE WILL NOT BE IMPOSED WITHOUT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE COSTS AND BENEFITS The benefits set out in Chapter 3 include reducing compliance costs and reducing the cost of administering the tax system. Who bears the costs and the costs of the changes need to be carefully considered before changes are made. Compliance costs Customers decide how to interact with the tax administration system, based on their skills, knowledge, inclinations and the benefits and costs they bear. Costs borne by business and other customers in dealing with the tax administration system are known as “compliance costs”. The Government has set a target of cutting the costs to business when dealing with government by 25% by 2017. Changes to the way the tax system is administered are expected to significantly contribute to this cost reduction. Administrative costs Customers decide how to interact with the tax administration system based on their own costs and preferences. They do not factor in the costs of administering the tax system, such as the fact that it is more expensive to process a paper return than an electronic one. These costs are borne by society as a whole. Outside the tax system, some private-sector businesses address the problem by imposing charges on customers who continue to use non-digital services after a digital alternative has been made available. In modernising the tax administration system, the Government needs to ensure that the benefits to society (taxpayers) as a whole from reduced administrative costs are appropriately considered. The next chapter looks at how this might be achieved. Administrative costs still reflect significant use of non-digital channels. In 2013 Inland Revenue issued approximately 25 million paper items, at a cost of approximately $18 million. These items include returns, letters, forms, statements and notices. In 2013-2014 Inland Revenue handled over 4 million assisted (not automated) phone calls. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 Do you agree that these principles are important when considering how greater use of digital technology might benefit all those who use the tax administration system? 2 Are there any other principles which ought to be taken into account? 20 Chapter 4 notes that while some digital services have already been delivered, their scope and sophistication are limited by the constraints of Inland Revenue’s outdated system. New technology would remove these system constraints, and allow the development of new and better digital services. This chapter looks at how new technology could deliver a better customer experience using digital services, based on the principles set out in chapter 5. CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS WILL BE MET BY A RANGE OF HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL SERVICES (Principle: No one size fits all) As noted earlier digital services must be designed with the customer at the centre. They will need to be easy to access and use, fast, secure and reliable. Digital technology is constantly evolving. A package of services which is designed for customers will need to be sufficiently flexible to keep pace with technology changes. Customers have indicated that they want a seamless experience through all available channels. For example, if they are filing a return online, they might want to be able to get help via telephone or email, or even complete their return over telephone or email, if they strike an unexpected difficulty. Customer-focused services need to allow customers to change the way they want to complete interactions, carrying across the information they already provided from one channel to another. Customer needs and their ability to use digital services also differ, both by customer type and by the interaction which they are having with Inland Revenue. The requirements that a large business has for dealing with Inland Revenue about income tax are likely to be quite different from the requirements an individual will have. In these kinds of situations, it is likely that different types of digital services will need to be developed to provide a customer-focused experience and recognise that “no one size fits all”. In some instances new services may be better provided by third parties than directly by Inland Revenue. CHAPTER 6 A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE USING DIGITAL SERVICES 21 EMPLOYEES BANKS CREDITORS DEBTORS Accounting Software EMPLOYEES BANKS CREDITORS DEBTORS Accounting Software CURRENT STATE Business customers need to interact with both their accounting software and Inland Revenue to meet their obligations FUTURE STATE Business customers only need to interact once with their accounting software to meet their obligations 22 A good example of different customer needs might be for businesses that have PAYE reporting obligations. A very small business using a simple manual payroll for one employee might be best served by something like an online portal which retains basic information into which they can enter current pay information. This could be provided by Inland Revenue, or a payroll software provider may provide this free as a marketing tool. Some customers’ needs will be best met through delivery by third parties For businesses that already use computerised payroll systems, the best kind of digital service might be one delivered by the private sector. This could integrate PAYE filing into their payroll accounting software removing the need to deal with PAYE filing obligations separately. This kind of integration with existing processes – in particular, business accounting systems – is a way of delivering services designed with the customer foremost. This kind of approach could deliver significant benefits to customers by eliminating the need for them to deal with routine tax matters as a separate exercise. Tax compliance could be integrated into business processes like weekly pay runs for PAYE or monthly sales reporting for GST. To integrate with existing processes, Inland Revenue would need to ensure it has close and collaborative working relationships with those who develop business accounting systems, and others who deal with individuals and businesses, such as financial institutions. Interactions differ, as well as customers Individuals and businesses will have different expectations of digital services. A person will have different expectations of customer-focused services, depending on the kind of tax interaction they require. Returning to the large business payroll example, direct integration with its payroll accounting system may be the best way to deal with the routine transfer of PAYE information. This may not be business’s preferred mechanism for a non-routine interaction. For example, if the Human Resource Manager and Chief Financial Officer become aware that the company’s previous PAYE treatment of redundancy payments has been incorrect they might want discuss this concern directly with Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that their routine PAYE is dealt with automatically through their payroll software. This need to discuss complex or sensitive matters might be best met by a different digital channel, such as an online enquiry portal or a dedicated email channel, or a non- digital channel such as a telephone contact centre. 23 MOST CUSTOMERS WILL CHOOSE TO USE DIGITAL SERVICES If individuals and businesses are offered good quality, secure, customer-focused digital services for interactions appropriately carried out across digital channels (including in partnership with third parties such as business accounting software providers), the majority can be expected to move to these services in the timeframe which best fits their own personal or business needs. They would likely do this because they identify the benefits that digital services would provide, such as greater convenience, certainty or reliability. Secondly, as noted in Chapter 4, despite the constraints of ageing technology, Inland Revenue’s ability to deliver quality digital services is recognised. Finally, and most compellingly, uptake of Inland Revenue’s digital services has, to date, been strong. As noted, the online service for individuals, myIR, has 1.7 million registered customers. In December 2014, 86% of payments to Inland Revenue were made through electronic channels. There are a number of strategies that Inland Revenue could develop to encourage customers to adopt digital services. One could be to move to a “digital by default” strategy, in particular for new customers (or existing customers who are starting to use a new form of interaction – such as registering for GST). A good example of this would be to use email to communicate with customers who have consented to this form of communication. Where a high-quality digital service exists (whether delivered by the private sector or directly by Inland Revenue), customers should be directed to that option as a matter of course. Non-digital alternatives should be de-emphasised in favour of the digital offering. This is simpler for customers compared with the alternative of adopting a non-digital option initially and subsequently facing the cost and disruption of moving to a digital option. When a new digital service has been established, Inland Revenue could expressly promote it, in particular to customers who are using the non- digital alternative. SOME CUSTOMERS CANNOT MOVE TO DIGITAL SERVICES Even if high-quality digital services targeted at all kinds of customers and appropriate tax interactions are built, there will inevitably be some customers who cannot adopt them. Reasons for this could include: • They do not have the skills or knowledge to use digital technology. • They do not have access to digital technology – they may be financially constrained, or perhaps live in an area of New Zealand which does not have internet access. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 Do you think you would move to digital services for your tax interactions, if high-quality digital services which met your needs were offered? Even in this situation, can you foresee any interactions which you would not want to carry out using digital services? What would they be? 2 What could Inland Revenue do to create an environment that supports new customers to adopt digital services? 3 What could Inland Revenue do to support existing customers using digital services? THE MEANING OF DIGITAL BY DEFAULT Being digital by default means producing digital services that are so compelling and easy to use that those who can do so will. Digital by default is also a shift in the culture of government so that it thinks “digital" first. Only then can the government create the outstanding digital services that people will embrace. "Digital by default" does not mean replacing services with a digital-only option (e.g. completely closing down the face-to-face approach or other alternatives). It is about encouraging people who can to turn to digital services first. The Government’s rural broadband initiative aims to connect 86% of rural homes and businesses to broadband at peak speeds of at least 5 Mbps by 2016. However, a segment of the population will continue to have very limited internet access. 24 For this group, the relevant principle is that tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical. Their ability to comply with their tax obligations and access their entitlements must remain even if the majority of other customers are carrying out those interactions through digital options. Two approaches could be offered to customers who cannot move to digital services. Both approaches would be operated simultaneously, with different customers falling into each approach. Assistance (Principle: Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical) The first approach is to provide some specific, targeted assistance to enable these customers to use digital services. There are two reasons for providing this kind of assistance – and both will raise additional costs for Inland Revenue: • Digital services bring a range of benefits to customers compared with non-digital services, as identified earlier. It is fair that customers who would otherwise not be able to access these benefits be supported to do so. • As noted in Chapter 5, Inland Revenue’s cost in dealing with digital interactions is lower than for non-digital interactions. Because society as a whole bears the cost of administering the tax system, (it is funded out of government revenue), providing additional support to enable customers to move to digital options delivers a benefit to everyone. The nature of assistance will vary from service to service and will need to be developed based on users’ needs. Some services will have more people who require assistance than others – for example, business services may need less support than a digital service which supports a user group with a lower level of digital skills. Some examples of this kind of assistance could be: • Recognition that online services require appropriate offline support – the New Zealand strategy for digital public services requires that it should be easy for New Zealanders to get sufficient support when using digital options. • Kiosks – Places where people who do not have internet access could go to use an internet-connected computer (whether provided by government or otherwise). Some specific assistance or even a digital service specifically designed for people who are not experienced internet users could even be provided. • Assistance to develop digital capability – Inland Revenue’s staff already help customers, including small businesses, to understand their tax obligations and how to use existing digital services. The United Kingdom has adopted an approach to “assisted digital” which provides that government will: • work with the private sector, voluntary sector and other parts of the public sector to provide assisted digital support • try new ways of working to provide assisted digital support efficiently and effectively • introduce a service standard, so assisted digital support is of consistently high quality • consider introducing a quality mark for approved/accredited providers so users can be confident in the support they will receive. A subsidy is currently provided to support the use of payroll intermediaries by certain small employers. Employers with less than $500,000 of PAYE deductions per year are entitled to a subsidy of $2 per employee, per pay period, for up to 5 employees, if they use a recognised payroll intermediary. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 4 Do you agree Inland Revenue should provide specific assistance to enable some customers to use digital services? What forms do you think that assistance might take? How long do you think that assistance should be provided for? 5 Who do you think will not be able to move to digital services, even with specific assistance? 25 • Subsidies – For example, to support businesses adopting accounting software which integrates tax and accounting functions. Other government agencies are also moving to provide digital services, and are likely to face the issues described above, with the same customers. Several of the forms of assistance described above could most efficiently be provided on a cross-government basis. This would also deliver a simpler and better customer experience. Non-digital services should be available for some customers (Principle: Tax compliance and access to entitlements are important) The second approach to this customer group is to acknowledge that, whatever support and assistance Inland Revenue or wider government might be able to offer, some customers will still not be able to directly use digital services. For example, a business in a remote location with no broadband internet access will not be able to use business accounting software which integrates tax obligations online even if the cost is subsidised. These customers will still need to manage their interactions with Inland Revenue through non- digital services. This could be done by ensuring existing non-digital services are provided. However, depending on the nature of some of Inland Revenue’s system changes, retaining existing services in their current form in the future may not be possible. In these cases, some process to convert non- digital to digital information might be required. Inland Revenue could carry out this process itself, or arrange for a third party to supply it. SOME CUSTOMERS COULD MOVE TO DIGITAL SERVICES, BUT WILL CHOOSE NOT TO (Principle: Change will not be imposed without careful consideration of the costs and benefits) These customers are not those subject to the constraints preventing adoption of digital services set out above but for whatever reason, have chosen not to move to digital services. As noted earlier in this chapter, once Inland Revenue has developed a comprehensive portfolio of high- quality digital services, the majority of customers who can adopt those services, are over, time expected to “vote with their feet” and move to digital services. The category of customers who can adopt those services but who choose not to is therefore expected to be small, and will diminish over time. It is likely that digital and non- digital services will sit alongside each other for some time, with the choice of channel being largely left to customers. There are two possible reasons for customers who could use digital channels, but who choose not to. 26 Additional and avoidable cost imposed on tax administration system The cost of delivering tax administration through digital services is typically lower than by non-digital equivalents. Because tax administration is funded out of government revenue, everyone bears the cost. Everyone benefits by having the most efficient tax administration system. Accordingly, allowing some customers to impose a cost on wider society because of a choice they made, rather than out of necessity would need careful consideration. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would need to work alongside these customers to support and encourage them to adopt digital services. The Commissioner also has the ability to determine the range of services which are offered, under her powers to administer the tax system. Those powers are set out in section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and give the Commissioner the duty to collect the highest net revenue over time, having regard to: • the resources available to the Commissioner; • the importance of promoting compliance; and • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. This provision requires the Commissioner to compare the additional costs these customers would impose on the tax system by not using digital services with the costs these customers would face in moving to digital services, and using those digital services on an ongoing basis. The Commissioner could make the decision under this provision to remove non-digital services for some customers for some transactions. As well as the additional and avoidable costs imposed on the tax system, the reluctance of these customers to use digital channels may also be imposing additional and avoidable costs on other agencies which rely on information provided by Inland Revenue. The Commissioner may also wish to take these costs into account in her approach to the use of digital channels by these customers. Any legislation which currently prescribes non-digital services would need to be amended to be neutral – see Chapter 7. Others are being denied the benefits of the new tax administration system As Inland Revenue’s transformation programme progresses, the levels of service offered to everyone affected by the tax system in some way are expected to significantly improve. In some circumstances, those improvements will be contingent on Inland Revenue receiving information through digital channels – for example, employers, who provide PAYE information about their employees to Inland Revenue. PAYE information is critical to determining matters like social policy QUESTION FOR READERS 6 Do you agree that when some people have a digital services option available, but by not using it are imposing a cost on everyone, they should be supported, encouraged and, if necessary, ultimately required to use digital services? 27 entitlements of employees. The tax system is likely to evolve so that Inland Revenue can deliver better services to these employees (such as correct calculations of Working for Families entitlements for each pay period, removing any need for annual square-ups), when their employers are working with Inland Revenue via digital services. Another example could be tax intermediaries, who provide information to Inland Revenue on the tax affairs of their clients. Inland Revenue may be able to deliver better services to these clients – such as allowing them to check their tax position online in near real-time, when their tax agents are working with Inland Revenue via digital services. As noted above, as well as this information being critical to determine the tax position of others, it may also be used by other government agencies to determine other liabilities. For example, information provided by employers to Inland Revenue is used by ACC to determine liability for earner account levies for employees. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would need to work alongside those who provide information to support and encourage them to adopt digital services. Again, the Commissioner’s powers under the Tax Administration Act will allow her to restrict the availability of non-digital channels for some transactions carried out by those who provide information if this was appropriate, although this would need to be evaluated against compliance costs for those affected. The Government sees the satisfactory resolution of this issue as critical to ensuring that the New Zealand economy as a whole derives maximum benefit from the Government’s investment in the new tax administration system, and the delivery of this benefit to some sectors of the economy should not be prevented by the reluctance of others to adopt digital services. Accordingly, the Government proposes to make it clear that any decision by the Commissioner to require these customers to use digital channels has the full force of law. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Most customers will voluntarily move to digital services, provided Inland Revenue builds (or works with the private sector to build) digital services that meet customers’ needs. Some customers will initially be unable to adopt digital services. Others will be able to adopt digital services if assistance is provided; and for the remainder, some non-digital services will need to be provided. Some customers will be able to adopt digital services, but may choose not to. This may be an issue if the cost of providing non-digital services for them becomes prohibitive, or others (such as their customers or employees) are denied the benefits that a modernised tax administration could otherwise deliver. For both categories, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could work alongside affected groups to encourage and QUESTION FOR READERS 7 Do you agree that where some people (such as employers and tax agents) who choose not to use digital services, and by doing so are denying others (such as their employees or clients) the benefits of the new tax administration system, that first group should be required to use digital services? 8 Do you agree that the Commissioner should use her existing powers under the Tax Administration Act, which include the requirement to have regard to compliance costs, to facilitate the move to digital services? 28 support them to adopt digital services. The Commissioner has power under existing legislation to require the use of digital services if necessary. However, the Government thinks that where others are adversely affected by someone not using digital services, the Commissioner's requirement to use digital channels should have the full force of the law.

Rules that govern the obligations and entitlements of customers are detailed in a body of legislation collectively known as the Inland Revenue Acts. Much of this legislation predates the widespread use of digital services. It is important that the legislation does not inhibit the development of digital services and that it is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the continued evolution of technology and services. This chapter looks at the Inland Revenue Acts and includes some proposals to remove barriers to establishing digital services. INLAND REVENUE ACTS The Inland Revenue Acts set out the obligations that customers and Inland Revenue must meet, including for the provision of information and returns. There are three categories of requirement dealing with how communication/interaction should be made: • those that are silent on how the engagement should be made; (see Appendix 2, example 1); • those that give the Commissioner a discretion on how the engagement should be made (see Appendix 2, example 2); and • those where the specific form of engagement is prescribed in legislation (see Appendix 2, example 3). No legislative change is needed for the first two categories. In the third category set out above, provisions which, for example, require information to be provided “in writing”, or “by post” (see Appendix 3) would appear to prevent the move to digital services. The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 can override these rules, if, effectively, both parties to the transaction consent. This would enable the Electronic Transactions Act to potentially override even specific requirements in tax legislation. While the Electronic Transactions Act would allow tax communication to move to digital services even in light of express requirements for non- digital services, this would conflict CHAPTER 7 REMOVING LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS TO DELIVERING DIGITAL SERVICES 30 with the important principle of tax legislation being as simple and clear as possible. The Electronic Transactions Act would also not deal with situations where the Commissioner has decided that certain customers should be required to use digital services. TIMING RULES The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out a range of rules by which various returns must be received, payments made, and other things must be completed. These rules were typically designed to deal with paper-based transaction systems. These timing rules would need to be reviewed to ensure that the requirements for the use of digital services are clear, and that there are no inadvertent timing benefits to customers in using non- digital compared with digital services. PROPOSALS The Inland Revenue Acts should be reviewed and provisions requiring non-digital communication removed to allow potential future use of digital services. Timing rules should be reviewed to ensure that rules for digital services are clear and align with non-digital services. QUESTIONS FOR READERS 1 Do you agree with the proposals that requirements for transactions to be carried out through non- digital services be removed? 2 Can you think of any legislative barriers other than those described above that need to be addressed to allow transactions to be carried out via digital services? 3 Do you agree with the proposal to ensure that timing rules for digital and non-digital services are aligned? 31 OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS’ DIGITAL APPROACHES Overseas revenue agencies are actively expanding digital services and self-management options, for example: DIGITAL SIGNATURESSpain has made progress in the development of authentication services, including the development of digital signatures. Mexico uses one identification system (digital signature) to support secure electronic transactions. ELECTRONIC MESSAGE/REMINDERThe United Kingdom uses electronic and phone messages to individual taxpayers with tax debt reminding them to pay. NATURAL SYSTEMThe Australian Tax Office has launched a reinvention programme that focuses on a strong staff and customer focus; mobile delivery; natural systems; voice ID and ATO as a wholesaler and retailer of services. Chile offers a free IT software solution that simplifies accounting management for small business taxpayers by allowing them to automatically capture information related to commercial transactions in the respective accounting journals thus complying with their tax obligations “on the go”. PR E - P O PU L AT E DATASingapore has introduced a “no-filing” service, if customers have only pre- populated income. It also offers pre-filled e-filing screen for individuals to view employment and deduction information. SMART PHONES AND MOBILE APPSChile launched a smart phone application for individual taxpayers to access services in an online authenticated and non-authenticated environment. Sweden uses a mobile application with a mobile electronic ID to facilitate interactions via mobile devices. REDUCE OTHER CHANNELS’ SERVICE OFFERING Canada gradually discontinued counter services as part of broader modernisation of the Canada Revenue Agency’s service delivery offering. PAPERLESS INTERACTIONDenmark improved the process of using individual income tax assessment including replacement of printed documentation with web services and issuing an online assessment with forecast of income and deductions to individual taxpayers. APPENDIX 1 32 OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS’ DIGITAL APPROACHES Overseas revenue agencies are actively expanding digital services and self-management options, for example: Example of silent legislation as to form of interaction and transaction with Inland Revenue Section 15I of TAA states: \[Procedure for revocation of listing\] (1) The Commissioner must notify a listed PAYE intermediary of an intended revocation under section 15H, and must provide reasons for the intended revocation. (2) If the listed PAYE intermediary who is notified by the Commissioner under subsection (1) does not resolve the matters set out in the notice to the satisfaction of the Commissioner within 30 days of the date on which they are notified, the Commissioner may give 14 days’ notice of revocation. (3) At the end of the 14-day notice period under subsection (2), the listing of the listed PAYE intermediary is revoked. (4) A decision by the Commissioner under this section is not open to challenge under Part 8A. Example of Commissioner having discretion as to form of interaction and transaction Section 34B of TAA states: \[Commissioner to list tax agents\] A person who is not a tax agent and who is eligible to be a tax agent may give a notice (the application) to the Commissioner in a form approved by the Commissioner— (a) stating that the person wishes to be listed as a tax agent; and (b) providing the information required by subsection (11), if the person is not a natural person; and (c) providing any other information required by the Commissioner. Example of where the specific form of interaction and transaction is prescribed in legislation Section 14B of TAA states: \[Giving of notices to Commissioner\] (1) This section applies when this Act or any other Act requires a person to give a notice to the Commissioner. (2) The person must give the notice in writing. (3) The person may give the notice to any office of the department. (4) The person may use the methods set out in subsections (5) to (7) to give the notice, subject to any conditions described in the subsection. (5) The person may give the notice by personal delivery, if the personal delivery is made during working hours. (6) The person may give the notice by an electronic means of communication, if the person complies with the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. (7) The person may give the notice by post— (a) to the street address; or (b) to the post office box number. (8) A notice given by post is treated as having been given at the time the notice would have been delivered in the ordinary course of the post. (9) The following provisions apply if there is a conflict between this section and a provision in this or any other enactment: (a) if the conflict is between either of subsections (2) and (6) and another provision, subsection (2) or (6) prevails; and (b) if the conflict is between any of subsections (3) to (5), (7), and (8) and another provision, the other provision prevails.

I’d like to get your views on proposed changes that use digital technology to make it simpler and faster for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Every day we interact with the tax system millions of times – employers paying PAYE deductions from their staff, the self-employed paying their income tax, banks deducting tax from interest payments, businesses collecting and paying GST and other taxes. People also pay their student loans and child support obligations and a host of other transactions. The Government thinks all of these transactions could be done more efficiently. I believe the best way to deliver better tax services to most of us is by using electronic and internet technology. New Zealand has a high rate of internet use so it makes sense to me to make greater use of digital services. The changes the Government is proposing would allow New Zealanders to spend less time on taxes and compliance, and more time on living their lives and growing their businesses. But the tax system belongs to all of us, and the proposed changes to the way tax is administered by Inland Revenue could affect you. The Government would like to hear your views on these proposals, and while you consider them, ask yourself the following questions: • If Inland Revenue offered digital services which met your needs, would you use them? • Who do you think should be helped to use digital services, and how? • Should some individuals and businesses be required to use digital services? Who? As Minister of Revenue, I care about the tax system and so should you. Taxes pay for the public services that are important to us: schools, hospitals, social welfare, roads, wildlife conservation, police and so much more. But there’s more to it. An efficient tax administration is critical to our country’s economic and social wellbeing. Our tax system is one of the best in the world and was an important factor in New Zealand’s strong economic recovery after the recession. I want to make sure we build on that. Please consider the proposals over the page then have your say at makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz. Hon Todd McClay MINISTER OF REVENUE makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz BETTER DIGITAL SERVICES FOR A BETTER TAX SYSTEM MAKING TAX SIMPLER Mike is 66 and retired, but still helps out at his former employer occasionally. He has reinvested his KiwiSaver funds in a range of New Zealand listed shares and bonds, and term deposits. What if Mike’s interest and dividends were already included in his online tax return? He could simply check everything was correct, and confirm and complete his return at the click of a button. MIKE: Individual Zack wants to establish an adventure tourism business and will employ three staff. Currently Zack would need to register separately for income tax, GST and as an employer. What if Zack could buy a “business in a box” accounting software package that would automatically register his new business with government agencies including Inland Revenue? ZACK: Small business THE PROPOSALS • Inland Revenue would work with third parties such as banks and business software developers so that tax interactions are built into a customer’s regular transactions rather than managing tax separately at specific times of the year. • Assistance would be provided to those who do not have access to digital technology, or the skills or knowledge to use it. Non-digital services will need to be provided for those who still cannot use digital services. • A process would be developed for moving those who potentially could use digital for some services, in circumstances where there would be wider benefits from them using digital services. HAVE YOUR SAY Go to makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz to find out more about these proposals and have your say. These proposals will need to be implemented by changes to law, as well as system changes at Inland Revenue. If the proposals are passed by Parliament, Inland Revenue will communicate the changes to New Zealanders well in advance of the changes coming into effect.

Ben works for the company on a casual basis when they need an extra hand. He is repaying his student loan and is entitled to Working for Families tax credits. What if Mary’s payroll software automatically sent Ben’s information to and from Inland Revenue as part of each weekly pay cycle, with his student loan repayments and Working for Families entitlement being automatically calculated and updated?

Against this background, in which people and capital frequently move through countries with different tax systems, tax authorities around the world are being challenged to revisit their approaches to tax administration, to become as efficient as possible. Recognising changing social norms opens a range of opportunities for simplifying tax obligations and taxpayer interactions with government. For example, with change in the use of technology, tax compliance can be made easier by relying more on a business’s existing systems or pre-populating tax returns. The tax system, in a broader domestic context, is integral to supporting the Government’s objectives for better public services, and ultimately for building a more competitive and productive economy. The Tax Administration Act 1994, which is the basis for the way our current tax system is administered, plays a significant role in ensuring the right incentives are in place to influence compliance with tax laws while also supporting these broader initiatives. In reviewing the Tax Administration Act in this consultation paper, fundamental issues have been considered. For example, some change is suggested to the current tax information and tax secrecy provisions to allow information to be better shared among government agencies so they can provide these better public services. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s role is also discussed in this same context. An increased emphasis on better interaction not just across government but also with foreign jurisdictions will be critical as we modernise New Zealand’s system. The future Tax Administration Act must be capable of accommodating these shifting needs and allow for a more resilient and responsive tax system to better fit New Zealand’s needs. The proposals outlined in this document for a modernised tax administration are considered in this broader framework. cHapter 1 overview 5 a beTTer Tax adminisTraTiOn Tax administration refers to the rules and processes for collecting and disbursing the revenue and payments administered by Inland Revenue. The efficiency and effectiveness of these rules and processes is just as important for maintaining fairness in the tax system as the rules defining how much tax is due. In March 2015 the Government released Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (the Green paper).1 The Green paper was the first in a series of proposed consultation documents looking towards a better tax administration for New Zealanders. The illustration below shows a high-level summary of each of the key elements in the modernisation programme.

The Government’s proposed modernisation and simplification of tax administration involves far more than simply updating a computer system. It also provides the opportunity to have a fundamental look at the way tax is administered in New Zealand and determine what changes need to be undertaken to meet the challenges of the 21st century. a framewOrk fOr 21sT cenTury Tax adminisTraTiOn The Government’s proposed framework for tax administration focuses on the roles of Inland Revenue, taxpayers and tax agents in a modernised tax administration. Being clear about the role of each party involved in the collecting and disbursing of revenue and payments is a crucial part of the future policy development work announced in the Green paper. To clearly set out the roles of these parties, this document in some areas includes Government policy proposals, and in others further signals the likely key features of the modernised tax administration. The proposed framework is set out in the following five chapters. Chapter 2 focuses on the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Information collection and tax secrecy are discussed in chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 5 sets out the future role of taxpayers and tax agents, and chapter 6 considers future issues relating to tax administration, including tax assessments.

Inland Revenue’s role is to administer the Inland Revenue Acts and to collect tax to the best of its ability. In doing so, the integrity of the tax system and the confidentiality of people’s tax affairs must be maintained. The Commissioner has statutory independence to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties. This discussion document examines the Commissioner’s role in three particular areas. The first is how the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility can best co-exist with the relatively newly enhanced chief executive responsibilities in the State Sector Act 1988. As well as accountability for Inland Revenue, the Commissioner has a role in ensuring Inland Revenue works more closely with other government agencies to deliver more efficient public services. Requiring the Commissioner, as a state sector chief executive, to be responsive to the collective interests of government may impact on the Commissioner’s statutory independence. The discussion document sets out how, in the transformed administration, the Commissioner’s role will continue to be complementary to her chief executive functions. Secondly, a clarification to the care and management provision in New Zealand is proposed, so that in some limited cases the Commissioner can apply the legislation in a way that does not tie up Commissioner and taxpayer resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and expectations. As a starting point for discussion, the proposal is that the Commissioner would be able to: • Apply a policy-based approach to small gaps in the tax legislation; • Deal pragmatically with legislative anomalies that are minor or transitory; • Address cases of hardship (inequity) at the margins; or • Deal with cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to formulate (meaning that the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation). Thirdly, this document also considers whether the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility in non- tax functions is adequately expressed in legislation. The non-tax functions include administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayments, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave. Most of these functions are relatively new compared with Inland Revenue’s functions for collecting tax. Clarification that the care and management responsibility applies to these functions would better support the Commissioner’s ability to use resources as effectively as possible to deliver more efficient services. 8 obtain information that is not needed. To administer the tax system efficiently, Inland Revenue must continue to be able to collect one-off taxpayer-specific and bulk information, and carry out repeated collection of third-party information. More robust rules for repeated access to large third-party datasets are therefore recommended. More taxpayers are storing information in the cloud and utilising cloud-based software. While Inland Revenue is able to use its search powers to access information stored remotely in some situations, these powers will require review to ensure Inland Revenue can access this information in all relevant circumstances. Information collection and tax secrecy (Chapters 3 and 4) Information flows are critical to Inland Revenue’s interaction with taxpayers and third parties. Inland Revenue deals with large numbers of documents, forms, letters and tax returns that contain information about taxpayers’ income or assets. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. The “necessary or relevant” standard, or something similar, should remain in the modernised administration. Retaining this standard means Inland Revenue would not be able to use its information-gathering powers to The prOpOsed framewOrk fOr Tax adminisTraTiOn t a x s e c r e c y r o l e o f t H e c o M M i s s i o n e r r o l e o f t a x a g e n t s r o l e o f t H e t a x p a y e r tax adMinistration act i n f o r M a t i o n c o l l e c t i o n 9 In order to ensure Inland Revenue’s ability to obtain necessary or relevant information no matter how it is stored, it is proposed that the rules regarding remote searches by Inland Revenue are clarified. The preferred approach is to align the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 with clarification of how Inland Revenue uses the remote access rules. This recognises that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without a requirement for a warrant. Tax secrecy or taxpayer confidentiality laws exist in most countries. Traditionally, tax secrecy is viewed as a means of improving compliance by reassuring taxpayers that it is safe to provide their information to Inland Revenue. New Zealand’s tax secrecy rule is considerably broader in application than it is in many other jurisdictions. It will be necessary to change the rules that permit the release of Inland Revenue’s information to make the modernised tax administration more efficient. Changing the rules will also allow Inland Revenue to work more closely with other government agencies. It is proposed to narrow the application of the secrecy rule to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer or taxpayers. The confidentiality of a taxpayer’s individual affairs would remain, as a starting point, protected. This would not mean that individual taxpayer information would never be disclosed. Rather, as is the case now, a specific exception authorised by legislation to the general rule of confidentiality would be required. Feedback is sought on whether taxpayers might be permitted to consent to the release of their information in certain circumstances. There is concern that a consent-based approach could result in coercion by third parties as a means of seeking information on an individual’s creditworthiness. Chapter 4 canvasses these issues and includes possible ways of dealing with the concern. Inland Revenue has the ability to enter into cross-agency information sharing agreements in the Tax Administration Act. Consideration could be given to greater use of this provision, or amending the criteria to better enable its use in a wider range of circumstances. The role of taxpayers and tax agents (Chapters 5 and 6) The transformed tax administration envisages providing improved delivery of digital services, greater use of withholding payments, enhanced pre-populated income tax returns and better use of a business’s existing systems to automate interactions with Inland Revenue. These features have implications for the obligations and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents and these are discussed based on the premise that the concept of self-assessment would be retained. Enhancing pre-populated tax returns with better information should reduce compliance costs and offer a more personalised tax return process. Tax 10 returns would also be more accurate, as the opportunity for taxpayer error would be reduced. This in turn would, for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue, reduce the resources currently required to correct return errors. This document considers the following: • the obligations of a taxpayer with a pre-populated return; • what responses would be required from a taxpayer receiving a pre- populated return and what should occur in the case of a failure to respond to a pre-populated return; and • the ability to amend information contained in the pre-populated return. Individuals dealing with Inland Revenue via digital services would be issued with a pre-populated tax return. Once completed, the taxpayer would be required to ensure the correct amount of tax is paid and by a specified time, as it is now. If the taxpayer failed to respond, a default assessment would estimate the amount of tax to pay and would remain in place until the individual filed a return. Better use of technology and information would allow Inland Revenue to add more than just PAYE information or taxes withheld at source to a pre-populated return. Reliable and comprehensive third- party information could be used in the pre-populated return. However, the specific nature of the information that could be pre-populated is likely to be considered in a later discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals. Chapter 5 also discusses the important role performed by tax agents and how this might develop under business transformation but does not suggest any legislative change in the area at this time. Finally, chapter 6 looks at the current advice and disputes rules, as well as the time bar and record keeping requirements. Feedback is sought on whether the current options for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view on specific issues are working well. A more individualised approach to the time bar is also discussed, which could reflect what Inland Revenue may be able to do in the future. Modernising the tax administration system provides an opportunity to recognise that taxpayer behaviour is complex. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour. Taking a new approach to compliance could mean taking a different approach to the way penalties are imposed. These matters will require further analysis once key features of the modernised tax administration have been decided and implemented. The starting point for this analysis will be the discussion document on improving the tax system for businesses. 11 Role of the Commissioner The roles of the Commissioner and Chief Executive of Inland Revenue are complementary and would continue to be fulfilled by one person. The Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility would be clarified to provide the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. The application of the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility to Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions would be clarified by introducing an additional limb to the current care and management provision. The role of taxpayers and tax agents When taxpayers receive a pre- populated tax return, an obligation to respond would be imposed. The required response would either be to confirm the return is complete, or to provide further information. Taxpayers receiving a pre- populated tax return would be required to assess their own liability, and confirmation of this return would be their self- assessment. Information collection and tax secrecy Inland Revenue’s information- collection powers would continue to ensure they support the modernised tax administration by retaining a “necessary and relevant” standard or an equivalent standard. Inland Revenue’s powers to access bulk third-party information would be clarified. Inland Revenue would be able to access remotely stored information in the same way that information stored digitally or physically on a taxpayer’s premises can be accessed. The secrecy rule would be narrowed from referring to “all information” to information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer. Consideration would be given to whether a taxpayer should be able to consent to the release of their information, in certain circumstances. Consideration would be given to how to Inland Revenue could support improved information flows between government agencies. summary Of prOpOsals 12 Maintain the integrity of the tax system Care and management of taxes Compliance activity & assistance Collect revenue & distribute payments Assist in wider government initiatives disburse payMents delivery of social policy services client disclosures & tax returns Joint delivery of services collect revenue self-disclosures ta x returns collected revenue polic y advice inland revenue ta x agents otHer governMent departMents governMent ta xpayers Manage other government portfolios Assist Inland Revenue in delivery of joint services Setting direction for overall tax policy Enactment of tax law Provide advice on applying tax law Provide assistance with compliance Self-assessment Comply with tax law 13 hOw TO make a submissiOn You are invited to make a submission on the proposed reforms and points raised in this discussion document.

The Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility should be clarified to provide the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. The application of the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility to Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions should be clarified by introducing an additional limb to the care and management provision to specifically refer to the non-tax functions. Inland Revenue’s primary functions are the collection and disbursement of revenue and payments. To enable Inland Revenue to carry out these functions, the Tax Administration Act confers on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue various responsibilities and powers. The Commissioner also has statutory independence from Ministers to ensure Inland Revenue is able to collect tax and carry out its duties independently. This chapter considers the role of the Commissioner, and how it should be described in the legislation. While the role of the Commissioner is for the most part clear and adequately expressed in the Tax Administration Act, there are two areas where the Government considers the Commissioner’s role could be reviewed to reflect the developments discussed in chapter 1. The first area considered is the relationship between cross- government reform and the stewardship of the tax system: in particular, being clear about how in an “all-of-government” environment the Commissioner’s statutory independence can best complement cHapter 2 tHe role of tHe coMMissioner of inland revenue 15 her responsibilities as a state-sector chief executive. The second area is how the “care and management” responsibility applies to Inland Revenue’s functions. This discussion document looks at two issues in this context: • Whether the Commissioner should, in limited circumstances, be provided with greater administrative flexibility under her care and management responsibilities; and • Whether the care and management responsibilities should more clearly apply to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions, especially as these functions have increased over time. These functions include administering Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayments, child support, KiwiSaver and paid parental leave. Before discussing the above issues, the Commissioner’s role as currently prescribed is considered. The cOmmissiOner’s rOle as currenTly prescribed As currently prescribed, the Commissioner has both responsibilities as a chief executive of a large government department under the State Sector Act, and specific powers and responsibilities as expressed in the Tax Administration Act and other Inland Revenue Acts.2 The key responsibility under the Tax Administration Act is to protect the integrity of the tax system, which also extends to Ministers and officials with responsibilities under the Revenue Acts.3 Parliament’s role Parliament both guides and constrains the role of the Commissioner, and the relationship between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. t a x s e c r e c y r o l e o f t H e c o M M i s s i o n e r r o l e o f t a x a g e n t s r o l e o f t H e t a x p a y e r tax adMinistration act i n f o r M a t i o n c o l l e c t i o n 16 The authority to levy tax belongs to Parliament alone. Parliament prescribes the tax laws that determine what the Commissioner and the taxpayer must do to discharge their respective tax administration and tax compliance obligations. The appropriation of resources available to the Commissioner to carry out her responsibilities is also determined by Parliament. Legislative prescription is necessary to ensure certainty in the rules and to retain a perception of impartiality by the Commissioner. Parliament determines how much prescription (versus Commissioner administrative decision-making) is desirable for these purposes. The Commissioner’s independence and accountability The basis of the Commissioner’s current independence and accountability arises from the State Sector Act, the Public Finance Act 1989 and the Tax Administration Act.4 To protect the integrity of the tax system, the Commissioner exercises a wholly independent judgement in relation to the tax affairs of individual taxpayers and any interpretation of tax laws. The Valabh Committee Report noted that the Commissioner’s independence “enhances the quality of such decisions (often of an expert kind) to the advantage of the parties directly concerned and indeed to the advantage of the Minister who can properly claim not to be responsible for the particular decision and to stand apart from it”. 5 Taxes play a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders. The Commissioner must continue to have independence in relation to the tax affairs of individual taxpayers because this independence is critical in ensuring taxpayers receive impartial treatment. The non-partisan administration of tax laws influences taxpayers to view the tax system as fair. The Commissioner is similarly expected to exercise independence in relation to her non- tax functions. The cOmmissiOner’s relaTiOnships wiTh OTher OrganisaTiOns and crOss- gOvernmenT refOrm A key priority for the Government is an efficient public service. This includes a responsibility to all New Zealanders to be efficient in administering the tax system. Government agencies, including Inland Revenue, are required to work more closely together and organise themselves around joint customers. Inland Revenue interacts with a large customer base as it connects with all New Zealanders and businesses. It therefore has an important role to play in building a more productive and competitive economy. Central to this cross-government strategy is the sharing of information, and using that information to support the delivery of services to New Zealanders. This means sharing more functions and services, focussing on customers’ needs, greater use of digital technology, and challenging old silos and barriers. 17 of, Inland Revenue. These include wider government opportunities and connections for Inland Revenue within the state sector and the implications of Inland Revenue’s policies and activities for related agencies. This also means being alert to the role other government agencies might have in a more efficient revenue system. The role of the Commissioner therefore has implications that can extend beyond Inland Revenue. Information Inland Revenue collects is critical to the delivery of some services by other agencies such as the Ministry of Social Development. The Government wants to see better information flows between government agencies to deliver more efficient outcomes for New Zealanders. It is within this context that the information collection powers and tax secrecy rules are discussed in chapters 3 and 4. Separating the role of the Commissioner from the role of chief executive would be impractical. At its worst, separation could lead to information and co-ordination problems between the two roles and difficulties in fully separating the activities of Inland Revenue. The responsibility for “responsiveness on matters relating to the collective interests of government” and the Commissioner’s statutory independence therefore need to co-exist. Requiring the Commissioner to be responsive to the collective interests of government implicitly requires her to consider allocating resources to the collective interests Inland Revenue works closely with a number of agencies, including the Ministry of Social Development, Accident Compensation Corporation, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Ministry of Justice, New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Customs Service. This cross-government approach includes delivering joint services and outcomes as well as providing and receiving information, which can be essential for all agencies to effectively perform their duties. Cross-government reform and stewardship of the tax system The dual roles of the Commissioner and the Chief Executive of Inland Revenue were considered in the Richardson review6 and are, by design, allocated to the same person.7 In 2013, legislative reforms relating to the responsibilities of public sector chief executives were undertaken to support the Government’s Better Public Services objectives. The Commissioner as the Chief Executive of Inland Revenue, in a similar manner to other chief executives, is responsible for “responsiveness on matters relating to the collective interests of government”.8 This responsibility reflects the Government’s objective of requiring government agencies to work together to be innovative and responsive.9 “Responsiveness on matters relating to the collective interests of government”10 requires the Commissioner to be aware of the wider influences on, and expectations 18 of government. Other government officials with broad statutory independence are faced with a similar issue of reconciling the responsibilities of state-sector chief executives with their statutory independence. For example, the chief executive of the Serious Fraud Office and the Government Statistician both have independent functions that co-exist with their roles as public-sector chief executives. Balancing two roles Currently, there may be occasions when there could be tensions between the collective interests of government and the Commissioner’s collecting and disbursing role. Under the current law, the Commissioner must fulfil both roles as both are expressed in absolute terms. Three options for addressing any possible conflict between the two roles have therefore been considered: • to maintain the status quo, where the Commissioner must reconcile the issue but may seek ministerial and state services sector advice in doing so; • to explicitly provide that in the rare circumstances when there is a conflict, the collective interests of government should be given priority over the collecting and disbursing role; or • alternatively, to explicitly provide that the Commissioner’s collecting and disbursing role should be given priority over the collective interests of government. Maintaining the status quo, as noted above, requires the Commissioner to comply with both roles. On the very rare occasion when the Commissioner has not been able to reconcile the responsibility to be responsive to the collective interests of government with her collecting and disbursing role, she can seek guidance from the State Services Commissioner and/or Ministers as appropriate. However, ultimately it is for the Commissioner to determine how to address the issue under her dual roles. When the whole-of-government obligations are considered as needing to take priority, Ministers and Parliament could consider whether a legislative change would be appropriate. The Minister of Revenue currently has some ability to issue directions to the Commissioner in relation to the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts, even after contrary advice from the Commissioner.11 However, the ability to give direction is limited. There can be no direction given concerning the tax affairs of individual taxpayers or the interpretation of tax law.12 Further, under the Tax Administration Act, the Minister has the same obligation as the Commissioner to protect the integrity of the tax system. The second option, in the rare circumstances when there is a conflict, would be to provide that the collective interests of government should be given priority over the collecting and disbursing role. Different mechanisms could be used to achieve that priority, including an amendment to the State Sector Act. 19 The third option for addressing the conflict would be to provide that the Commissioner’s collecting and disbursing role should be given priority over the collective interests of government. This option would give the Commissioner the ability but not the obligation to maintain, as required, an appropriate balance between the interests of government and the integrity of the tax system. On balance, it is proposed that the status quo is maintained. The existing framework recognises that the Commissioner’s role as an independent statutory officer will continue to complement her chief executive function. The complementary nature of the roles is reflected in Inland Revenue’s responsibility to all New Zealanders to be efficient in the collection of revenue used to fund government programmes. This includes developing a range of different working relationships with other organisations, including strategic partnerships, to deliver some services and support the wider government sec tor. adminisTraTive flexibiliTy under The cOmmissiOner’s “care and managemenT” respOnsibiliTy It is a reality of modern tax administration that Inland Revenue must carry out its functions in a way that that makes the most effective use of its resources. The Tax to protect the integrity of the tax system Responsiveness to the collective interests of Government coMMissionercHief executive t a x a d M i n i s t r a t i o n a c t s t a t e s e c t o r a c t / p u b l i c f i n a n c e 20 Administration Act reflects this by charging the Commissioner with the “care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts and with such other functions as may be conferred on the Commissioner”.13 One of the key aspects of the Commissioner’s care and management of the tax system is applying and explaining the law to taxpayers. Generally, the tax law can be interpreted consistently with the policy intent. However, in some cases the interpretation of the law when applying ordinary statutory interpretation principles may not accord with the policy intent. This ties up Commissioner and taxpayer resources in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. In this situation, the Commissioner cannot ignore or not apply the law as she has interpreted it. This is because, as a matter of constitutional law, only Parliament has the ability to impose (or suspend) taxes. While a legislative amendment can be sought to remedy the issue, this may not necessarily avoid the Commissioner and taxpayers having to commit resources to the issue. This chapter considers two approaches to providing the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility to reduce the resources that are tied up in outcomes that are inconsistent with the practice and policy intent. The first approach is to extend the Commissioner’s discretions or determination-making powers that attach to specific provisions. These generally exist to aid the administrative and self-assessment process by setting out detail for which primary legislation may not be the most efficient vehicle. However, the process could also be used to possibly address unforeseen interpretive issues for particular areas of tax law. The second approach, which could apply within a more general framework, is to extend the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility under her care and management responsibilities. It proposes clarifying the Commissioner’s care and management responsibility to provide her with greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances, based on the assumption that the current interpretation of the Commissioner’s responsibility is a relatively narrow one. Enhancing the Commissioner’s discretion under the care and management responsibilities more substantially would be another alternative, but may create risks for the tax system. Discretions and determination- making powers The Commissioner’s current administrative discretions allow her to carry out her revenue-collection duties and generally assist taxpayers to assess their own tax liability. Discretions include the ability to: • prescribe forms and notices; • require further detail or take into 21 account any relevant factors; • allow further time; and • provide PAYE tables. Determination-making powers allow the Commissioner to issue a determination under a defined process. Examples include determinations for: • depreciation rates; • financial arrangements; • departure from the formula assessment for calculating child support; • national average market values for livestock; and • relocation payments and allowances. Other discretions give further ability to the Commissioner to determine taxpayers’ income tax liabilities. These discretions include provisions allowing the Commissioner to reconstruct a tax avoidance arrangement and the ability to amend an assessment despite the time bar. The objective of these discretions, which can apply to specific taxpayers or transactions, is to ensure the revenue base is protected. Increasing the Commissioner’s discretions and determination-making powers would provide her with increased administrative flexibility but may, on the other hand, increase the administrative resources needed to be allocated to the relevant issue. This may not be consistent with the efficiency objective of self-assessment. In addition, on a case-by-case basis, this approach would need to be scrutinised relative to Parliament’s law-making function so that any perceived risk to the integrity of the tax system is minimised. Further, this approach would generally only increase administrative flexibility for situations that could be anticipated, such as complicated valuation issues. It will not generally assist when the interpretation of the law is subsequently found to be inconsistent with the policy intent. Care and management responsibilities The Commissioner has some broader administrative flexibility under her care and management responsibilities. The care and management responsibilities were modelled to some extent on the United Kingdom care and management provision. That provision has been interpreted in the United Kingdom statutory context as providing the Commissioner with wide managerial discretion. One of the key aspects of the United Kingdom statutory context is the well-established tradition of extra-statutory concessions. The New Zealand provision has been interpreted in the relevant statutory context more narrowly, providing the New Zealand Commissioner with more limited administrative flexibility. This is consistent with the lack of extra-statutory concessions in New Zealand. The role of the Commissioner in New 22 Zealand was discussed by the Valabh Committee and the Organisational Review Committee. In its report on various aspects of the income tax system, the Valabh Committee noted that the Income Tax Act imposed the obligation to pay income tax, and that the Commissioner’s statutory functions were directed to calculating the amount of tax liability. The Valabh Committee considered that in its “extreme form” the law obliged the Commissioner to “assess and recover all taxes which are due”, an unrealistic obligation that did not match the practice of Inland Revenue.14 Following the Valabh Committee recommendations, the Organisational Review Committee was set up to investigate the optimal organisational arrangements for the tax system. The Organisational Review Committee considered that the Commissioner’s responsibility for the “management of limited resources in the efficient and effective collection of taxes” was encapsulated by the term “care and management”. The Organisational Review Committee defined care and management as “ \[m\]anagerial discretion as to the use of independent statutory powers in a cost effective manner”.15 The Organisational Review Committee considered that the objective for the tax administration function of Inland Revenue should incorporate several elements, namely that Inland Revenue should: • operate within the law; • collect the highest revenue that is practicable over time. This recognises that the tax administration’s objective should not be to collect either “all” or only “some” revenue; • collect revenue at the least administrative cost; • operate within the resources appropriated by Parliament; and • have regard for the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers.16 Both the Valabh Committee and the Organisational Review Committee referred to the United Kingdom “care and management” provision. As noted earlier, while the New Zealand provision was to some extent based on the United Kingdom provision, the relevant provisions are worded differently, there are different statutory and administrative contexts, and there are different levels of administrative flexibility in the two jurisdictions. Inland Revenue has published an interpretation statement providing an interpretation of the care and management responsibilities that takes into account the New Zealand legislative provisions and the approach of the New Zealand courts.17 The statement views the “care and management” responsibility as two interrelated responsibilities. First, the Commissioner is charged with the “care of the taxes”. This means the Commissioner is responsible for promoting the integrity and effective functioning of the tax system. To discharge this responsibility, the 23 Commissioner must seek to foster the tax system’s capacity to function effectively throughout economic, commercial, technology and other change. Secondly, the Commissioner is charged with the “management of the taxes”. This means that she is responsible for making managerial decisions in the interests of bringing about the efficient and effective administration of the tax system. The “management” responsibility also recognises that the Commissioner makes decisions about the allocation and management of her resources and acts consistently with her responsibilities under the State Sector Act. This involves the Commissioner exercising judgement in how she carries out her duties and the relative resource she allocates to Inland Revenue’s functions. Importantly, the Commissioner’s view is that she can manage and allocate resources but cannot deliberately act contrary to her view of the correct interpretation of the law. Some important implications of this are that the Commissioner cannot: • disregard the requirements for the lawful exercise of powers and discretions conferred by other provisions; • alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements; • issue extra-statutory concessions; • administratively remedy legislative errors and other deficiencies; • interpret provisions other than in accordance with statutory interpretation principles contained in the Interpretation Act 1999 and court decisions; or • act inconsistently with the obligation to use her best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. Options for administrative flexibility Two options have been considered for the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility under her care and management power: • legislating to make it clear that the Commissioner has greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances; or • significantly enhancing the Commissioner’s discretion under the care and management power. The Government proposes clarifying the care and management responsibility to allow the Commissioner some greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. Retaining the status quo is considered to provide the Commissioner with insufficient administrative flexibility in the modernised tax administration. Significantly enhancing the Commissioner’s discretion under the care and management responsibilities, on the other hand, may create perceived risks for the tax system, such as inconsistent decision-making and less transparency. However, it is expected this would in practice very 24 would take up a disproportionate amount of parliamentary time. The Court held the issue in dispute in the case did not fall within the scope of these criteria so it was not within the Commissioner’s care and management discretion to allow the income tax reduction for the widower. It is arguable that subsequent United Kingdom cases have broadened the discretion of the United Kingdom Commissioner beyond the categories discussed in Wilkinson.19 However, the criteria set out in Wilkinson may provide a suitable basis for a discussion of how to extend the administrative flexibility in New Zealand. If such an approach were adopted, an issue would arise over whether the extension of administrative flexibility would be limited to situations that were taxpayer-favourable. This would not seem necessary, as given the very limited nature of the criteria, it would be expected that the change would in practice be limited in this way. significantly enhancing discretion under care and management responsibilities Another approach would be to enhance the Commissioner’s discretion under her care and management responsibilities more substantially. This could be achieved by providing the Commissioner with a broad discretion to administratively remedy legislative errors and deficiencies. However, it is considered that this could create undue risk to the tax system. First, it could undermine rarely occur in a well-administered tax system. Greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances Providing the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances would reduce the extent to which Commissioner and taxpayer resources were tied up in outcomes that were inconsistent with both parties’ likely practice and expectations. The New Zealand care and management provision was modelled to some extent on the United Kingdom care and management provision. The United Kingdom provision was considered in the House of Lords decision of R v Inland Revenue Commissioners; Ex parte Wilkinson.18 The case involved a widower, Mr Wilkinson, who claimed that the Inland Revenue Commission (as it was called at the time of the case) had the power to grant him a widower’s bereavement allowance from his income tax liability. The relevant provision granted a “widow” the right to an income tax reduction. The House of Lords held the provision did not extend to a widower. In deciding the case, the Court held that the discretion under the United Kingdom care and management provision enabled the commissioners to formulate policy in the interstices of the tax legislation, deal pragmatically with minor or transitory anomalies, cases of hardship at the margins or cases in which a statutory rule was difficult to formulate or its enactment 25 Parliament’s role in imposing tax. As a result, uncertainty could arise for taxpayers if the Commissioner was seen to have a general authority to ignore the law. This could arise, for example, from perceptions of inconsistency in treatment, a lack of transparency or uncertainty about the future application of the law. There would also be revenue risks if the Commissioner had a general authority to decide whether or not to apply the law in a specific circumstance especially if, as would be expected, the discretion only applied in taxpayer-favourable situations. Another concern is that it would be difficult to decide where to draw the line in determining whether to apply the discretion, and significant taxpayer and Inland Revenue resources could be tied up in debating such issues. While it is acknowledged that a significantly enhanced discretion would provide the Commissioner with broad administrative flexibility, this option is not recommended for the reasons given. Suggested approach As a starting point for discussion, a clarification is proposed to the care and management provision in New Zealand to include the situations mentioned in Wilkinson. The proposal would not be to incorporate the United Kingdom approach to the care and management provision, but instead to consider what could be drawn from the criteria listed in Wilkinson, adapted for the New Zealand statutory context. On this basis, the proposal is that the Commissioner would be able to: • apply a policy-based approach to small gaps in the tax legislation; • deal pragmatically with legislative anomalies that are minor or transitory; • address cases of hardship (inequity) at the margins; or • deal with cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to formulate (meaning that the relevant legislation has failed to adequately deal with the particular situation). It is less clear whether a criterion for the discretion should specifically include avoiding taking up a disproportionate amount of parliamentary time (as suggested in Wilkinson). That said, applying the discretion according to the criteria listed above would, in practice, produce the benefit of reducing the amount of parliamentary time taken up with minor or temporary anomalies. There may also be a case for including an ability for the Commissioner to confirm an approach based on a long-standing established practice of both the Commissioner and taxpayers. However, further analysis of the potential boundaries of such an approach would be required. We recognise that the criteria outlined above are a starting point for discussion and more detail will 26 need to be developed to establish the boundaries for their application. Submissions are therefore welcomed on this issue. Any application of the proposed clarified care and management responsibility would need to be weighed against any possible implications for taxpayer compliance over time and the integrity of the tax system. Specifically, the Commissioner would have to weigh the application of the discretion against the right of a taxpayer to have their liability determined fairly and impartially. This would suggest that the Commissioner could not treat a taxpayer or group of taxpayers unfairly or preferentially compared with other taxpayers. The Commissioner would also have to ensure that any application of the clarified care and management responsibility had regard to promoting voluntary compliance by taxpayers and reducing compliance costs. It is acknowledged that giving greater administrative flexibility to the Commissioner could, in theory, lead to greater uncertainty for taxpayers and questions as to the application of the rule of law. If the proposed clarification is limited in the way suggested, these implications are unlikely to be significant. Examples The following hypothetical examples are seen as falling within the criteria for the proposed clarification of the discretion. The examples represent situations when the Commissioner is dealing pragmatically with a minor or transitory legislative anomaly. example 1 The policy intent of a provision is to enable either a value for a fringe benefit to be established by reference to an open market transaction, or to be a value set by the Commissioner if that benefit cannot be valued under a specific provision. The policy intent and desired outcome are clear. The wording restricts the application of the rule to goods or services and does not allow the Commissioner to set a value for something that is not a good or a service, such as a discount on a sale price. This situation would seem to be either an unintended gap in the tax legislation or a minor anomaly. Dealing with this issue quickly would eliminate any uncertainty and require fewer resources to resolve. example 2 A drafting error exists in a specific provision which prevents taxpayers from using different calculation methods for determining their foreign investment fund (FIF) income when they have more than one investment in the same FIF. This unintended restriction is contrary to the policy intent, which was to allow taxpayers to use different methods in certain circumstances. The policy intent and desired outcome are clear. A bill before Parliament provides for the drafting error to be remedied retrospectively. 27 The Commissioner would be able to deal pragmatically with the transitory legislative anomaly by allowing taxpayers to use different calculation methods. The rOle Of care and managemenT in nOn-Tax funcTiOns It is also proposed to clarify how the care and management responsibilities relate to the Commissioner’s non- tax functions. As noted earlier, the Commissioner’s care and management responsibility is intended to allow the Commissioner to exercise appropriate management, given available resources, when faced with real-world challenges. Legislation for the care and management responsibility provides the Commissioner with a duty to “collect over time the highest net revenue practicable”.20 Legislatively clarifying how “care and management” applies to Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions would better support the effective and efficient administration of these functions. The Organisational Review Committee considered that a separate objective was required for Inland Revenue’s “social assistance and information supply functions that are outside the narrow tax administration”.21 However, when the care and management provision was introduced, the definition of “tax” was amended to include any revenue or entitlements covered by the Inland Revenue Acts. This meant the care and management responsibility essentially covered all of Inland Revenue’s functions. No separate objective was enacted for Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions. “Tax” is defined in seven separate paragraphs of the Tax Administration Act. The definition ensures that the Tax Administration Act applies to the non-tax functions for specific purposes (such as the penalties regime). The legislative history of the definition of “tax” in the Tax Administration Act suggests that the policy intent may not be clearly reflected in the legislation. This creates some uncertainty as to the application of care and management to the social policy functions performed by Inland Revenue. For example, the definition is a mix of general concepts such as “tax means a tax, levy, or duty of any type...” and very specific language such as, tax means “an amount payable by a payer (as defined in section 153 of the Child Support Act 1991) under Part 10 of the Child Support Act 1991”. The use of very specific terms in the definition of “tax” raised in 2010, for example, the possibility that care and management had a specific and restrictive application to student loans inconsistent with the policy intent. To reflect the intent that care and management applied broadly to the non-tax functions, the definition of “tax” for student loan purposes was amended. This highlights the potential for ambiguity over the application of care and management to all non-tax functions. As noted, Inland Revenue’s guidance 28 has not previously considered how the care and management responsibility applies to non-tax functions. This, combined with the potential legislative ambiguity, suggests that clarification is needed to ensure care and management applies broadly to the social policy functions. Potential solution It is proposed that an additional limb to the care and management provision be added that is specific to the objectives of Inland Revenue’s non-tax functions. This provision could reflect more accurately the Commissioner’s role in non-tax areas, ensuring that the Commissioner can set priorities in the context of resources and real-world choices when collecting and distributing student loans, child support, KiwiSaver and Working for Families tax credits. The Commissioner does not necessarily have sole responsibility for the stewardship of particular social policy programmes, compared with tax where she is the sole (or at least primary) custodian. For example, student loan policy is led by the Ministry of Education as part of wider tertiary education policy. Inland Revenue collects student loan repayments, ensures repayment obligations are met by borrowers, and provides operational policy advice on matters concerning collection of loans. The approach suggested above would ensure that the care and management function applied broadly, consistent with the original policy intent envisaged by the Organisational Review Committee in 1994. In making managerial decisions about resource allocation, the Commissioner needs to take account of the opportunity costs, fairness to customers in similar situations and society, administrative and fiscal costs and impacts on the Government’s broader policy objectives. The role of care and management needs to be considered for each non- tax function. With this in mind, the Commissioner’s role in administering the non-tax functions can be categorised in three ways: • the Commissioner acting as an intermediary, collecting from one group and distributing to another (with or without an administrative charge or interest), usually on trust – for example, child support and KiwiSaver; • the Commissioner distributing only, paying out an entitlement from Crown revenue, distinct from the obligation and liability to pay tax – for example, Working for Families tax credits and paid parental leave; and • the Commissioner collecting only, recovering monies that are not tax revenue – for example, student loan repayments, and child support to offset benefit payments. Providing for an additional limb to the “care and management” provision in the legislation would remove the risk that any amendment to the definition 29 of “tax” for another purpose will inadvertently affect the application of care and management in non-tax areas. It would also close the door to any debate over whether or not care and management principles apply in non-tax areas. Focusing on the efficient use of the Commissioner’s resources on collection and compliance would better support the Commissioner’s ability to deliver the Better Public Services efficiency gains the Government expects. key quesTiOns fOr readers 2 .1 Do you support giving the Commissioner the discretion to enable her to: • apply a policy-based approach to small gaps in the tax legislation; • deal pragmatically with legislative anomalies that are minor or transitory; • address cases of inequity at the margins; or • deal with cases in which a statutory rule is difficult to formulate.

This would include: • retaining a “necessary or relevant” standard, or something similar, for Inland Revenue’s information- collection powers; • clarifying Inland Revenue’s powers for access to large third- party datasets21; and • clarifying Inland Revenue’s access to remotely stored information, just as information stored digitally or physically on a taxpayer’s premises can be accessed. Inland Revenue’s information- collection powers are critical to the collection and disbursement of revenue and payments for the Government. As one court noted:22 The whole rationale of taxation would break down and the whole burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers if the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information about taxpayers who may be negligent or dishonest. Improving information and intelligence capabilities is an important aspect of modernising the tax administration. The future tax administration will involve greater use of pre-populated tax returns, more automated and streamlined information flows, and a broader approach to compliance based on smarter use of information and a wider range of interventions. The management of information is therefore a critical factor in the success of the modernised tax administration. The Government considers that Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers work well and are consistent cHapter 3 inforMation collection 31 with those of revenue agencies in other jurisdictions. However, the ways in which information is stored have changed. More information is stored in the “cloud” and large electronic datasets have become more commonplace. Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers therefore need to be updated to ensure they continue to be fit for purpose. Tax returns are a key source of information for Inland Revenue. There is a range of information reporting and return requirements set out in the various Inland Revenue Acts – for example, annual income tax returns, employer monthly schedules, and GST returns. Outside of the tax return process, Inland Revenue can require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” to Inland Revenue’s functions. The Government considers that, in updating Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers, a “necessary or relevant” standard or something similar should be retained. Retaining such a standard would give Inland Revenue and the public continued confidence that Inland Revenue will not use the information- gathering powers to obtain information that is not needed. A key area for consideration, however, is the power to collect large datasets. Inland Revenue’s information- collection powers were designed in a world where the collecting and analysing of such datasets was difficult to achieve. To efficiently administer the tax system, Inland Revenue needs to continue being able to collect one-off taxpayer-specific and bulk data, and carry out repeat collection of third-party information. The Government proposes clearer rules for repeating access to large third-party datasets. Another question concerns access to remotely held data. To maintain the integrity of the tax system, the Government proposes ensuring that Inland Revenue is able to access all remotely stored information just as it t a x s e c r e c y r o l e o f t H e c o M M i s s i o n e r r o l e o f t a x a g e n t s r o l e o f t H e t a x p a y e r tax adMinistration act i n f o r M a t i o n c o l l e c t i o n 32 can access information stored digitally or physically on a taxpayer’s premises. inland revenue’s infOrmaTiOn- cOllecTiOn pOwers A taxpayer’s information obligations include keeping all necessary information, disclosing to Inland Revenue in a timely and useful way all information required by the tax laws to be disclosed, and cooperating with Inland Revenue to the extent required by the law. Inland Revenue’s general information-collection powers are set out in the Tax Administration Act. Some parts of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 supplement the powers contained in the Tax Administration Act.23 Powers contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 Inland Revenue’s general information- gathering power is contained in section 17 of the Tax Administration Act. This section requires that: • any person, upon request by the Commissioner, must furnish in writing any information, and • produce for inspection any document, the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts or any other function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. Inland Revenue is also empowered to access premises to obtain information (a warrant is required for private dwellings) and to remove documents to copy or retain for a full and complete inspection.24 There are further powers for Inland Revenue to conduct inquiries of any person, either before the Commissioner or before a District Court Judge.25 OECD comparative information from 2013 indicates Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers are broadly consistent with those of revenue bodies in the OECD.26 information-collection powers of other new Zealand agencies Many New Zealand government agencies, including the New Zealand Customs Service, the Serious Fraud Office, the Department of Statistics, and the New Zealand Police have information-collection powers. Inland Revenue’s information-gathering rules are generally broader than those of other New Zealand government agencies. This reflects the importance of revenue collection to fund government programmes. While many other agencies have information collection or search powers, in most cases the issue of a warrant is required before these powers can be exercised. Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers do not require a warrant, except in relation to searches of private dwellings. The powers granted to the New Zealand Police for collecting information and evidence are set out in Part 2 of the Search and Surveillance 33 ta xpayer s 3 rd parties tax agents otHer governMent departMentsgovernMent advice and tax inforMation services and business inforMation inland revenue statistical inforMation and reporting client inforMation bulk data tax returns and inforMation client tax returns and inforMation sHared inforMation assistance and personal inforMation 34 other forms of income where there are similar withholding and reporting requirements. The standard of some small businesses’ financial systems and business processes may in some cases adversely affect their ability to meet their tax obligations. The OECD’s Forum on Tax Administration issued a report in 2014 focusing on information collection as a means to support a “right from the start” compliance approach.27 This report introduced the concept of “tax compliance by design”. Tax compliance by design focuses on building compliance into existing business processes, and real-time collection of data about business transactions. While the report did not recommend any specific design, systems adopting this approach tend to rely on automated processes that translate the data into information about the taxes due, and where possible, automate payment of those taxes. The OECD describes two approaches for implementing the “tax compliance by design” concept. Depending on the approach taken, there are implications for Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers. A “secured chain” approach focuses on ensuring the appropriate certified systems (such as certified cash registers and approved online accounting systems) are used and therefore requires fewer information flows to Inland Revenue. A “centralised data” approach requires significantly more information flows to Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue would analyse and use that Act. Most of these powers require an “issuing officer” (a Judge or other person such as a Magistrate, JP or Registrar, at that time authorised under the Search and Surveillance Act) to issue a search warrant. Part 3 sets out powers of “enforcement officers”. An enforcement officer includes an Inland Revenue officer. The need fOr an infOrmaTiOn cOllecTiOn sTandard As noted earlier, the Inland Revenue powers to access premises to obtain information, or to require information to be furnished, are bounded by the requirement that the Commissioner considers the information is “necessary or relevant” for carrying out Inland Revenue’s functions. Given the broad nature of Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers, the “necessary or relevant” requirement is an important assurance. It is important to be clear how this requirement applies to the features of the modernised tax administration that require information collection. Information collection in the transformed environment Similarly to many overseas revenue authorities, Inland Revenue is considering how best to use technology to improve compliance for small and medium-sized enterprises. Withholding taxes and income reporting systems have meant that, generally, high levels of compliance are achieved in relation to employment income and any 35 information to pre-populate a tax return, which would then be sent to the business to verify and/or provide any missing information. cHaracteristicssecured cHaincentralised data Revenue agency exampleAustralia, DenmarkChile, Korea Revenue agency exampleTa x p aye rThird parties Level of data/information used by revenue body Aggregated data Transaction or aggregated data Scope regarding number of taxpayers involved Ideally all but sub- segments possible Preferably all taxpayers Scope regarding type of transaction data All transactions for involved taxpayers Preferably all but limited scope possible Preferred environment for taxpayers Extensive use of accounting software Extensive use of third- party reporting and VAT e-invoicing Main focus of Revenue agencyDetecting evasion outside secured chain Structure and analyse data (for use) Demand for third-party information Limited but still a necessity (expectation is the taxation authority would still require some large external datasets) Extensive Pre-populating of tax returnsNone or limitedComplete or almost complete The table below summarises the main characteristics of “secured chain” and “centralised data” approaches. 36 PAYE and GST28 asks whether there is information that employers provide to other government agencies that could more appropriately be provided to Inland Revenue through the PAYE process. As set out earlier in this document, increased information sharing is a priority for government, as a means to deliver better public services. Looking at how information is collected is another possible method of achieving efficiency and reducing compliance costs for customers interacting with government. At this stage the Government is not proposing any broad changes to the type of information Inland Revenue collects. However, once the modernised tax administration is in place, there will be opportunities to consider how information might be collected on behalf of other agencies. If information is to be collected on behalf of other agencies, legislative change is likely to be required. In considering collection on behalf of others, there are a number of issues, in addition to the wider government efficiency benefit, to be worked through. In particular, if Inland Revenue were to collect additional information on behalf of other agencies, the Government would want to be confident that this would not compromise the integrity of the tax system and, specifically, compliance with tax obligations. cOllecTiOn Of large daTaseTs The availability and usability of large datasets, aided by technology, has It is clear these strategies are not mutually exclusive and both could be used. In the Green paper the Government set out a vision for modernising the tax system. The vision for small and medium businesses in the modernised tax administration includes more elements of a secured chain strategy. For individual taxpayers the vision has more elements of the centralised data strategy. As will be outlined in chapter 5, the current personal tax summary process involves using information collected from employers in the course of administering the PAYE system. It is proposed that there will be greater use of information to pre-populate individual tax returns – for example, the Green paper outlined a review of the information requirements for resident withholding tax (RWT). This review will look to enhance the provision and timeliness of information regarding RWT, with a view to using it for (among other things) pre-population of returns. Any changes to information provision rules in relation to this data would occur through changes to the specific RWT reporting rules. As discussed later in this chapter, where information is sought primarily for the purposes of pre-populating returns, formal third- party reporting regimes, such as those for PAYE or RWT, will normally be the most appropriate approach. Collection of information on behalf of other agencies The discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of 37 greatly improved and is likely to continue. While the courts have made clear that Inland Revenue’s existing information-collection powers do enable collection of such datasets, and such collection currently occurs, the powers were designed in a world when collecting and analysing these datasets was difficult to achieve. The Government proposes clarifying the existing rules to ensure Inland Revenue has appropriate powers to collect one-off taxpayer-specific and bulk data, and has repeat access to third-party information to enable it to administer the tax system efficiently. This clarification is focused on repeating collection of datasets primarily for compliance, analytical or customer education purposes, rather than to support pre-populating individual tax returns. Clarifying these powers will also provide greater comfort to the dataset holder of the circumstances when they will be required to comply with an information request. Existing collection powers The collection of datasets covering multiple taxpayers, or potential taxpayers, is not new. Inland Revenue has the power to require a person to provide any information considered “necessary or relevant” by the Commissioner. As with any information request, a request for an external dataset sits within the legislative framework of protecting the integrity of the tax system, and the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibility. The courts have recognised that the power to require information to be provided is an important power and that it allows Inland Revenue to collect large datasets. A Court of Appeal decision observed:29 Extensive powers of inquiry are a fundamental feature of revenue legislation in New Zealand as in other jurisdictions, and the Commissioner has in practice relied on section 17 and its predecessors as authorising the obtaining of relevant information, not only in relation to the affairs of specifically identified taxpayers, but also as to the identity of persons engaging in taxable or potentially taxable activities. The Directory of Official Information (1985, p460) records that the Commissioner has obtained a nominal index of all owners of land from the Valuation Department, schedules of payments to medical practitioners from the Department of Health and the Accident Compensation Corporation, and details of interest and dividends paid by banks, borrowing institutions, companies and other entities. And the Solicitor-General gave various other examples of lists of those engaged in particular commercial, and thus prima facie taxable, activities obtained from third parties. To ensure the collection powers are used appropriately when dealing with large volumes of information from third parties, Inland Revenue has an External Dataset Framework. An “external dataset” is one that 38 relates to unknown individuals or entities and is requested by Inland Revenue from a third party for use in risk and intelligence analysis, and ensuring taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax and receive the correct entitlements. External datasets include bulk datasets, information is obtained from open sources such as public registers, commercially acquired datasets and information in the public domain. Australian approach The Australian Tax Office uses guidelines issued by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, entitled Data Matching in Australian Government Administration.30 The Australian Tax Office website lists nine current data- matching protocols covering a wide range of information.31 For example, the Specialised Payment Systems protocol sets out 18 entities from which data is sought, including banks, PayPal Australia and a range of other specialised payment systems. This is in addition to data collected under the Credit and Debit Card-matching programme which collects payment information from banks and credit card providers. Legal authority to obtain the information is provided by legislative provisions that are the broad equivalent of New Zealand’s section 17 power to require any person to furnish information when requested, together with the power to require the information to be given under oath.32 The Australian Treasury has recently released an exposure draft of new rules on third-party reporting.33 This follows the release of a discussion paper in February 2014.34 The new rules, which operate in addition to existing information-collection powers, specify particular entities that are required to report to the Australian Tax Office on a regular basis. The general outline explains that a range of information is currently received from third parties for post-lodgement compliance activities through both legislated reporting regimes and ad hoc requests under the general information collection power.35 While the information received through existing legislative reporting regimes is generally of a high quality, information gathered under the general collection power can have greater issues with timeliness, data formats and the ability to easily match the information to the relevant taxpayer. The new rules are intended to further reduce compliance costs for individual taxpayers by increasing the range of information reported to the Australian Tax Office that can then be used for pre-populating returns. The information has the ability to be an effective compliance tool to deal with those taxpayers who omit or under- report income. There is a recognised policy trade-off, however, between the compliance benefits to taxpayers from improved data-matching capabilities and the compliance costs imposed on the third parties required to report. To minimise these costs, the new rules focus on third parties that already collect the information as part of their business or activities. 39 United Kingdom rules The United Kingdom has enacted very prescriptive rules regarding the collection of information from “relevant data holders”.36 The rules set out in considerable detail who is a relevant data holder by reference to activities that give rise to income. The Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs Compliance Handbook states that the purpose of the information-gathering powers is to gather specific pieces of information about a group of people, for use in risk analysis. Clarifying Inland Revenue’s information-collection power Consistent with the existing broadly cast information-collection powers, the Government proposes building on Inland Revenue’s ability to collect external datasets, to better enable regular, repeat collection of such information. This would mean new additional powers, rather than a replacement of any part of the current rules. The primary focus of the proposed powers is on ensuring Inland Revenue has the ability to regularly collect external datasets, where the Commissioner considers collection is necessary or relevant, for compliance, analytical or customer education purposes, rather than for use in pre-populating returns.37 When it is considered that information should be collected regularly to support pre-populating returns, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, the Government considers a formal third- party reporting regime would be an appropriate option. This is because requiring third parties to provide this kind of information regularly could involve a significant compliance cost. This must be balanced against the wider compliance benefit to society resulting from greater detection of under-reported or non-reported income, and the efficiency of collecting the information in a large dataset rather than needing to seek information from many taxpayers, including perhaps those who are not operating within the tax system. In proposing to clarify this collection power, the Government is considering whether a greater level of transparency might also be appropriate. As noted, in Australia there is a considerable degree of transparency covering the large dataset collection undertaken by the Australian Tax Office. In New Zealand, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is currently trialling a transparency reporting programme by way of seeking standardised reporting from companies regarding the requests for information they receive from law enforcement agencies (including Inland Revenue). remOTe accessing Of infOrmaTiOn More taxpayers are storing information using “cloud” technology and using cloud-based software. While Inland Revenue is able to use its search powers to access information remotely in some situations, these powers will require review to ensure Inland Revenue can access this information in all relevant circumstances. To maintain 40 the integrity of the tax system it is important Inland Revenue is able to access this information in the same way as information stored digitally or physically on a taxpayer’s premises.38 The Search and Surveillance Act contains specific provisions on remote access search powers. A “remote access search” is a search of an item such as an internet data storage facility that does not have a physical address that a person can enter and search. The powers in the Search and Surveillance Act, however, are crafted in relation to remote access searches authorised under search warrants. In many cases Inland Revenue’s search powers are carried out without the need for a search warrant (unless the search is of a private dwelling, when a warrant is required). Inland Revenue is not therefore covered by these provisions when carrying out a search that does not require a warrant. Currently Inland Revenue accesses “cloud” or other remotely stored information in the course of exercising its search powers under the Tax Administration Act – that is, when on-site at a business premises or private dwelling, and the relevant storage is open. This might be, for example, an email account that is open on the computer at the premises being searched. Certainty is needed on whether Inland Revenue is able to access electronically stored information under the following circumstances: • when the account is closed and password protected;39 • when the information is encrypted; or • when information has been deleted remotely by the taxpayer upon Inland Revenue entering the premises. The issue of remote deletion is of particular concern. Inland Revenue is currently not accessing information stored remotely from sites other than a premises being searched. It is not being accessed from Inland Revenue offices by digital forensics experts. To ensure Inland Revenue has the ability to obtain necessary or relevant information, no matter how stored, the Government proposes clarifying the rules around remote access searches by Inland Revenue. The preferred approach is to align the rules in the Search and Surveillance Act with clarification of how Inland Revenue uses the remote access rules, recognising that many Inland Revenue searches are carried out without requirement for a warrant. This will entail some remedial amendments to the legislative provisions governing remote access. key quesTiOns fOr readers 3.1 Do you agree with a more explicit collection power that covers remote access and bulk information datasets? 3.2 Do you have any comments on the necessary and relevant requirement that is proposed to be retained? 21 Information requested by Inland Revenue for the purpose of administering the Revenue Acts, where the information is obtained from a third party and includes records relating to multiple unknown individuals or entities. 22 New Zealand Stock Exchange and National Bank of New Zealand v CIR \[1992\] 13 NZTC 8,147. 23 For a table summarising those parts that apply see Appendix 1 to the Commissioner’s Operational Statement 13/01 The Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s search powers. 24 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 16. 25 Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 18 and 19. 26 OECD (2013), Tax Administration 2013: Comparative information on OECD and other advanced and emerging economies, OECD Publishing.

The coverage of Inland Revenue’s secrecy rule should be narrowed from all information to protecting information that identifies, or could identify, a taxpayer. Options should be considered for: • a taxpayer being able to consent to the release of their information in certain circumstances; • Inland Revenue supporting improved information flows between government agencies. Inland Revenue’s current information approach involves the use of broad collection powers (as discussed in the previous chapter) and a strict rule of secrecy, with a number of exceptions. Other legislation relating to the release of information is largely subordinate to the rules set out in the Tax Administration Act. Tax secrecy or taxpayer confidentiality laws exist in most countries. The tax secrecy rule in New Zealand is considerably broader in application than that of many other jurisdictions. The Government considers some degree of change is needed to allow the modernised tax administration to be more efficient and to ensure Inland Revenue can have, where appropriate, a more active role in working with other government agencies. Provisions protecting taxpayer confidentiality have been in place for over 130 years.40 Traditionally, tax secrecy was viewed as a means of improving compliance by reassuring taxpayers that the information provided to Inland Revenue would not be used for anything other than administering the tax system. cHapter 4 tax secrecy 42 Today, the secrecy rule provides, as a general starting point, that Inland Revenue officers must maintain secrecy on all matters relating to the various legislation administered by Inland Revenue, and must not communicate any matter other than for the purpose of carrying into effect that legislation.41 The tax secrecy rule is supported by taxpayer confidentiality and forms a key role in maintaining the integrity of the tax system.42 The coverage of the general secrecy rule is not limited to taxpayer- specific information, rather to all information relating to the legislation administered by Inland Revenue. This means that even statistical information or information that does not identify particular taxpayers is covered by tax secrecy and cannot be disclosed unless it is for tax purposes, or some specific exception is contained in the legislation. While the tax secrecy rule has never been absolute, over time further exceptions have been added and there are now a number of exceptions to the general rule. Many of these exceptions relate to cross-agency disclosure of information. A taxpayer cannot waive the tax secrecy rule for information about them – secrecy is an obligation imposed on Inland Revenue officers, not a privilege or right of the taxpayer.43 The tax secrecy rule is distinct from the privacy protections in the Privacy Act that an individual can waive.44 This means a specific exception is required to allow the disclosure of information about a specific taxpayer to that same taxpayer. raTiOnale fOr Tax secrecy An important rationale for tax secrecy is as a balance for the broad information-gathering powers granted to Inland Revenue. Revenue agencies are generally granted wide information-collection powers so they can properly ensure that taxpayers t a x s e c r e c y r o l e o f t H e c o M M i s s i o n e r r o l e o f t a x a g e n t s r o l e o f t H e t a x p a y e r tax adMinistration act i n f o r M a t i o n c o l l e c t i o n 43 are meeting their obligations. It is sometimes said the quid pro quo for these powers is that the information is subject to a strict rule of secrecy. It has been noted by one court, in considering a challenge to Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers, that the “stringent secrecy obligations” imposed on Inland Revenue reflected “a legislative balancing of the public interest affecting privacy on the one hand and in the ascertaining of liability for tax on the other”.45 The tax secrecy rule was traditionally considered necessary to promote compliance. As one court noted in an often referenced passage:46 The total confidentiality of assessments and of negotiations between individuals and the Revenue is a vital element in the working of the \[tax\] system. It rests on the assurance provided by stringent official secrecy provisions that the tax affairs of taxpayers are solely the concern of the Revenue and the taxpayers and will not be used to embarrass or prejudice them. That fundamental premise underlies the secrecy provisions of the income tax legislation in New Zealand as in other countries and is reflected in the very limited disclosure provisions contained in standard double tax treaties. It has also been observed that compliance would be placed in jeopardy unless all taxpayers know that Inland Revenue will act firmly and resolutely with those who do not meet their obligations, otherwise complying taxpayers will perceive there is a lack of integrity in the system and that they are carrying an unfair burden.47 This supports the use of information to call taxpayers to account as a “carrying into effect” function. There have been situations in which Inland Revenue has disclosed confidential information in an attempt to bring taxpayers to comply in particular cases, as such disclosure was considered to be “carrying into effect the Revenue Acts”.48 Recently, the protection of taxpayers’ privacy has also featured as a justification for tax secrecy.49 All Ministers and officials of any government agency that have responsibilities under the Inland Revenue Acts are required to protect the integrity of the tax system. The “rights of taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential” is only one aspect of the integrity of the tax system; another is the responsibility of taxpayers to comply with the law. Previously, Inland Revenue was required to publish names of taxpayers liable to shortfall penalties for evasion or an abusive tax position, those convicted of applying a deduction or withholding of tax to a purpose other than payment to Inland Revenue, and those convicted of evasion or a similar offence.50 This requirement was repealed on the basis the rule was inflexible, excessively harsh on some taxpayers, and potentially ineffective. Publication of names does still occur 44 in appropriate cases, through publicity after court-imposed sanctions. In the future, the ability to publicly disclose the names of taxpayers in certain circumstances may be re- considered. The focus is more likely to be on situations when there has been significant non-compliance, there is a continuing risk to the revenue base, and disclosure is for the purpose of maintaining the integrity of the tax system. Changes to the scope of these rules are being considered and may be included in a subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion document. Tax secrecy in OTher jurisdicTiOns A recent study of tax secrecy and tax transparency which compiled reports from 37 countries51 (including New Zealand) found that most countries were, in principle, required to keep information confidential. However, the study found that whether, and to what extent, confidentiality might be considered an actual right in tax matters was a far more complex issue than it might first appear. There is a significant variation across countries regarding the transparency of tax information, ranging from countries that make tax information quite transparent, including allowing publication of tax-relevant information, to countries that strongly protect confidentiality. The appendix provides more information on the approaches taken in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Finland. secrecy in OTher new Zealand agencies Inland Revenue is not the only agency subject to some form of statutory secrecy rules. Examples of others include the Serious Fraud Office, the Security Intelligence Service and Statistics New Zealand. Other agencies such as the New Zealand Customs Service also have particular restrictions on information use set out in their governing legislation. Other relevant New Zealand legislation While the Tax Administration Act plays the primary role in regulating Inland Revenue’s use and disclosure of information, other legislation including the Privacy Act, the Search and Surveillance Act and the Official Information Act apply. There is also legislation relating to the maintenance and disposal of information, such as the Public Records Act. The purpose of the Official Information Act is to facilitate open government and the presumption is that government agencies will be as open as possible. Similarly, the Privacy Act gives individuals the right to access personal information held by an agency about them. The Privacy Act also sets out Information Privacy Principles, relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, and contains specific frameworks for the sharing of information by government agencies. While the Privacy Act and the Official Information Act reflect broader 45 government policy, it is clear that they do not override specific provisions in other legislation, including the Tax Administration Act. Therefore, rights of access to information under both the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act are subject to the tax secrecy rule. infOrmaTiOn sharing Inland Revenue currently has information-sharing agreements with 11 agencies.52 These agreements are authorised either via specific exceptions to the tax secrecy rule, “information-matching” provisions, or broader information-sharing provisions. Currently there are 32 specific exceptions contained in section 81(4). For the most part these relate to disclosures to other departments. Information sharing between other government agencies is generally regulated by the Privacy Act. In 2013, new rules were put in place permitting and governing “approved information-sharing agreements” (AISAs) between agencies delivering public services. A specific exception to the tax secrecy rule allows Inland Revenue to share “personal information about an identifiable individual” under an AISA. Therefore not all taxpayer-specific information held by Inland Revenue can be shared.53 Inland Revenue also holds substantial amounts of information about non-individual taxpayers, such as companies. This information can be very sensitive and, in many cases, personal and non-personal information is mixed. The Privacy Act also contains an exception to principle 11 (which prevents disclosure) permitting disclosures made in order to “avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law”. As Inland Revenue is subject to additional statutory secrecy requirements, the Privacy Act “maintenance of the law” exception does not apply. The introduction of the AISA approach was intended to improve public service delivery by providing for “better and smarter information sharing”.54 Under this approach, Inland Revenue has entered into two agreements. The first allows Inland Revenue to obtain address information from the Department of Internal Affairs (being information received in the course of passport applications) for the purpose of locating and contacting overseas- based student loan borrowers. The second agreement is to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the New Zealand Police, for the purpose of combating serious crime. Tackling and preventing organised criminal activity is an important focus for the Government.55 Inland Revenue holds information that may be of assistance to other law enforcement agencies charged with addressing organised crime (including the New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service and the Serious Fraud Office). The Government is giving particular consideration to how to use information more effectively to combat organised crime. This includes the possibility of Inland Revenue sharing non-individual 46 ta xpayer s 3 rd parties tax agents otHer governMent departMents governMent advice and tax inforMation services and business inforMation inland revenue statistical inforMation and reporting client inforMation bulk data tax returns and inforMation sHared inforMation assistance and personal inforMation client tax returns and inforMation 47 administrative co-operation between states for the assessment and collection of taxes, with a particular view to combating tax avoidance and evasion. Co-operation ranges from exchange of information, including automatic exchanges, to the recovery of foreign tax claims. New Zealand is a signatory to the Convention, which entered into force for New Zealand on 1 March 2014. International sharing of tax information among revenue agencies is not a new concept. Providing information has long been part of New Zealand’s double tax agreements. In addition, tax information exchange agreements are in place with some jurisdictions where there is no double tax agreement. What is new is the magnitude and automated nature of the FATCA and AEOI models, which will result in significant amounts of tax information being shared regularly and automatically around the world. crOss-agency infOrmaTiOn sharing The Government, through its Better Public Services initiative, expects agencies to work together to deliver improved services and results for New Zealanders. For Inland Revenue, the strict rules regarding secrecy can act, or be perceived, as a barrier to working more collaboratively with other agencies. Over the years a number of exceptions have been added to the secrecy rules. While some of these relate to revenue purposes or functions of information with law enforcement agencies. Currently, sharing under the AISA with New Zealand Police is limited to information about individuals. The need for greater information sharing is not only a domestic issue. Recent years have seen a significant increase in expectations around international sharing of tax information. The introduction of FATC A56 has imposed requirements on financial institutions to collect and provide information to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service regarding the accounts of U.S. persons. In New Zealand, Inland Revenue has taken on the responsibility of collating the information provided by New Zealand financial institutions and passing it on to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Following the information-collection requirements of FATCA is the OECD-led Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI). AEOI involves the systematic and periodic transmission of bulk taxpayer information regarding sources of income from the country in which the income is sourced to the country in which the taxpayer is resident. Such information can provide timely indications of non- compliance. Compliance with AEOI is expected to be mandatory for New Zealand financial institutions from 1 January 2018. AEOI has followed the earlier OECD (and Council of Europe) Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Convention). That Convention provides for all possible forms of 48 Inland Revenue, others do not. In many cases these exceptions relate to situations when Inland Revenue information is used to support another government agency. As the Government seeks greater information sharing across agencies, and better co-operation in the form of initiatives including co-located sites, joined-up service delivery and fusion centre57 arrangements, tax secrecy is increasingly a barrier to Inland Revenue contributing to wider Government goals. The Government is currently considering how to better use agencies’ information. The Data Futures Forum, a working group set up by Ministers, has provided some recommendations about how New Zealand could better use its data, based on guiding principles of value, trust, inclusion and control. The Government has recently announced the subsequent formation of the Data Futures Partnership, a cross-sector group that will work together to drive high-value and high-trust data use. The Data Futures work focuses more broadly than just Government sector information sharing, looking more generally at how to enable more data- driven innovation across all sectors. Alongside the Data Futures work, the Government Chief Information Officer is leading work on the Government ICT Strategy, which includes making more effective use of government’s information resources. The New Zealand Customs Service has also recently consulted on changes to its legislation, including changes to enable greater sharing of Customs’ information. The increasing momentum to share more information and participate in more cross-government initiatives, coupled with the current focus on how to better utilise government information, makes this an appropriate time to consider whether Inland Revenue’s current secrecy rules remain fit for purpose in a transformed tax administration. a new apprOach TO Tax secrecy While the tax secrecy rule increasingly causes tensions for Inland Revenue in the cross-agency context, a starting principle that taxpayer information should be confidential is both a longstanding element of New Zealand tax law and consistent with most other jurisdictions across the world. The reasons for this principle are threefold: to increase voluntary compliance by assuring taxpayers their information will go no further; as a balance for the broad information- collection powers granted to Inland Revenue; and, in more recent years, to protect the privacy of taxpayers. These reasons are overlapping, and the courts have noted the necessity of balancing rights to confidentiality against taxpayers’ obligations to comply with the law. Inland Revenue is perhaps also unique in the quantity and breadth of information it holds. As discussed in chapter 3, some other New Zealand agencies also have significant information-collection powers. However, Inland Revenue collects and holds information on virtually all New Zealanders, and most corporate and other entities, such as trusts 49 and partnerships. In some cases the information held can be sensitive, particularly in the commercial context where a significant amount of financial information is held. The audit process, disputes procedures, binding rulings and other processes also generate highly sensitive information. Confidentiality in the relationship between taxpayers and Inland Revenue is a longstanding and important concept. It is consistent with international norms (and with the basic premise of the Privacy Act), has a perceived positive impact on compliance and a clear role as a balance to Inland Revenue’s broad information-collection powers. The Government does not therefore propose to step completely away from the concept. The remainder of this chapter considers options for how a general framework of confidentiality with clear exceptions can be maintained, while modernising and allowing for greater cross-government information- sharing. Tax secrecy Or Taxpayer cOnfidenTialiTy? As the current tax secrecy rule covers all matters relating to the Inland Revenue Acts, it is not limited to taxpayer-specific information. This means, unless an exception applies, anonymised information, statistical information, information about processes, and many other types of information held by Inland Revenue cannot be disclosed. In Australia, Canada and the United States, the information subject to the tax secrecy rule is much narrower, being generally limited to information that would identify (directly or indirectly) the taxpayer to whom it relates. The Government proposes narrowing the ambit of the tax secrecy rule so that it applies only to information that would directly or indirectly identify a taxpayer. The confidentiality of a taxpayer’s individual affairs would remain, as a starting point, protected. This would not mean individual taxpayer information would never be disclosed, but rather, as is the case now, a specific exception authorised by legislation to the general rule of confidentiality would be required. In narrowing the secrecy rule, appropriate protections would remain in the Tax Administration Act for sensitive information about Inland Revenue processes, or when the release of information would be damaging to the integrity of the tax system. Narrowing the tax secrecy rule would allow Inland Revenue to assist with more requests for information, when that information is anonymised, and in many situations, aggregated. It would also enable Inland Revenue to provide more information in response to Official Information Act requests. Tax secrecy takes precedence over the provisions in the Official Information Act (as is the case with any other specific information restrictions in other legislation), meaning Inland Revenue can only consider releasing information under the Official Information Act when the information is not required to be kept secret. 50 In narrowing the coverage of the tax secrecy rule, consideration needs to be given to how redacted information could be treated – for example, redacted adjudication reports or other decisions of interpretive assistance – and where the line between truly anonymised information and information that could identify a taxpayer lies. releasing infOrmaTiOn wiTh Taxpayer cOnsenT Tax secrecy is currently unable to be waived by a taxpayer in relation to information about them – secrecy is an obligation imposed on Inland Revenue officers, not a privilege or right of the taxpayer. This is distinct from an individual’s privacy protections under the Privacy Act, which the individual can waive. Therefore, if a taxpayer needs to provide their tax information to a third party, including another government agency, they would need to request the information themselves and then provide it to that third party. As part of the Government’s Better Public Services initiatives, customer consent to their information being shared to improve services is increasingly being explored. Allowing taxpayers to consent to the disclosure of information about them could potentially enable greater participation in optional cross-government services, such as initiatives to make updating contact details across government agencies easier. It is important to note, however, that this would not affect Inland Revenue’s ability to share information without consent where legislative authority exists. Allowing taxpayers to consent to information about themselves being released would need to be subject to restrictions or limitations. This would ensure consent did not become, in effect, coerced, and avoid the requests becoming administratively burdensome for Inland Revenue. The possibility that consent becomes essentially mandatory or coerced is a primary concern. While this could apply equally to consent-based sharing both within government and outside of government, there is potentially greater concern around the possibility, for example, of commercial providers of credit requiring tax records before processing or approving a credit application. This would effectively make the consent mandatory and result in significantly more information about a taxpayer’s private financial affairs becoming available. This may suggest that should consent-based disclosure be permitted, it should, at least in the first instance, be limited to within government. The changes considered here would not alter the position of a taxpayer seeking information about themselves. Currently, information is not provided to a taxpayer when it is not readily available within Inland Revenue, or when it is not reasonable or practicable to provide the information. In addition, the Privacy Act allows information to be withheld when the release of the information would prejudice the maintenance 51 of the law, when the release of information would involve the unwarranted disclosure of someone else’s affairs, or when the information is evaluative material (this exception usually applies when the requester is an employee or potential employee).58 In practice, taxpayers can easily access a certain amount of information about themselves via online services. For example, by logging on to Inland Revenue’s online services, a taxpayer can see income information, information about payments made and owing, social policy obligations, employer deductions and so on. It is possible that in the future, integrated services would largely negate the need for a legislative amendment to allow consented disclosures within government. In this case, the taxpayer could simply access the information themselves through an online portal and send it on to the relevant agency or agencies, without those agencies having to seek information from each other. crOss-gOvernmenT infOrmaTiOn sharing Information is a significant asset of government. For it to achieve the best value for taxpayers it is important that information can be shared across government when appropriate. Cross- government information sharing can lead to better service and ensure that New Zealanders receive their correct entitlements. While Inland Revenue already shares information with a range of other government agencies, research indicates that New Zealanders believe more information is shared across government than is actually the case.59 Historically, information sharing has required a specific legislative change to authorise the sharing. The Privacy Act AISA approach was designed to make information sharing easier for government agencies, while maintaining transparency for the public. Rather than specific legislative change, an AISA is authorised via the Order in Council process, meaning they can be put in place in a more timely and cost-effective manner than if a change to primary legislation is required. Inland Revenue’s current cross-agency sharing provision in the Tax Administration Act operates in a similar way. Given the current desire for greater sharing of information between government agencies, and the analysis currently occurring to improve the flow of information across the public sector, it is worth considering how the Tax Administration Act might be amended in the near term to support information sharing. As noted, Inland Revenue already has a cross-agency sharing provision in the Tax Administration Act. This provision allows information sharing agreements to be authorised by Order in Council where the receiving agency is entitled to collect the information itself but it is more efficient to obtain the information from Inland Revenue. Consideration could be given to greater use of this provision, or amending the criteria to better enable its use in a wider range of circumstances. 52 Commercial information Discussions on information sharing in the wider government context tend to focus on personal information. Alongside personal information, Inland Revenue also holds significant amounts of commercial information, much of it sensitive. Often the personal and non-personal information is inextricably linked. When the two can be separated, it reduces the value of the information to the user. Inland Revenue’s current information sharing about serious crime is an example of where this difficulty arises. Currently, information can be shared about individuals involved in serious crime, but not entities involved in serious crime. There are, however, situations when entity information ought to be shared in relation to serious crime, and personal information can be inextricably linked or the line between what is personal information and what relates to an entity can be unclear. Certain types of information sharing about individuals, which may be used to ensure benefit entitlements are being appropriately accessed, are well established and appear to be reasonably well accepted. Outside of the Tax Administration Act, information about individuals is subject to the requirements of the Privacy Act, meaning there is a clear framework for how personal information is treated, and how it can be shared. No such legislative framework exists for business or commercial information. It may be that there is less concern about some basic business information such as identifying details or basic income information and more concern about sensitive information, such as information that could prejudice a business commercially. The Government’s New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) project will see a register of businesses created that contains basic information, that would be available to the public. A register of business information is not new – this builds on the existing Companies Register and extends a publicly available register to all businesses regardless of form. All companies have now been issued a NZBN as part of the first step of rolling the NZBN out to all New Zealand businesses. The NZBN Bill proposes that only “primary business data” will be available on the register. This is a limited category of information, namely the NZBN, entity type, location, business start date and whether it is an active business. For companies, the legal name and registered address is also included. As noted, Inland Revenue is perhaps unique in the breadth and quantity of information it collects and holds. This is particularly so in relation to commercial information, much of which can be very sensitive. For example, the rulings function can give rise to taxpayers providing highly sensitive commercial information in order to obtain an advance ruling on the tax implications of a major transaction. This could, for example, be an as yet commercially confidential future transaction such as a takeover 40 The first tax secrecy rule was contained in the Property Assessment Act 1879. Section 8 stated: “Every officer, clerk, or other person appointed under this Act shall maintain, and aid in maintaining, the secrecy of all matters that may come to his knowledge in the performance of his official duties, and shall not communicate any such matter to any person whomsoever, except for the purpose of carrying into effect the provision of this Act.” 41 Tax Administration Act, section 81(1). Note that there are also secrecy and disclosure rules contained in some of the other Inland Revenue Acts. 42 Tax Administration Act, section 6(2). 43 With an attendant criminal penalty for breach – see section 143C of the Tax Administration Act. 44 See Information Privacy Principle 11 paragraph (d) contained in section 6 of the Privacy Act 1993. 45 New Zealand Stock Exchange v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1990\] 3 NZLR 333 (CA). 46 Knight v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1991\] NZLR 30 (CA). 47 Raynel v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2004) 21 NZTC 18,853 (HC) – note this case concerned sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act rather than the secrecy provisions, however the discussion about the promotion of voluntary compliance is relevant.

It also does not cover information about deceased individuals. 54 Privacy (Information Sharing) Bill 318-1 (2011) Explanatory Note 55 Hon Anne Tolley,“Whole of Government action plan on tackling gangs” (4 August 2014), http://beehive.govt.nz/release/whole-government-action- plan-tackling-gangs 56 The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is a piece of United States legislation.

US citizens and tax residents are required to report their worldwide income to the Internal Revenue Service whether they live in the US or not. 53 or restructure, or a complex financing transaction, or an advance pricing agreement. Equally, the audit and disputes processes can result in Inland Revenue obtaining very sensitive commercial information. On the other hand, Inland Revenue also holds a wealth of information, including basic data and statistics about non-individual taxpayers that might be of use in the wider government context without prejudicing the commercial position of the taxpayer or taxpayers to which it relates. It is important to find an appropriate dividing line to balance the sharing of data where that would significantly aid the integrity of the tax system or lead to significantly enhanced cross-government processes and the need to ensure that businesses are not commercially prejudiced. An example of a situation in which sharing commercial information might enhance cross-government processes is in relation to streamlining business imports to remove any timing mismatch between GST input and output tax. Submissions from businesses on the recent review of the Customs and Excise Act have suggested that there is an opportunity to manage GST at the border more efficiently. Any such changes would require greater sharing of information between Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service. key quesTiOns fOr readers 4 .1 Do you agree with narrowing the coverage of secrecy to taxpayer-specific information? 4.2 Do you think consent-based disclosure should be permitted, and should it be limited to within government? 4.3 To what extent should Inland Revenue increase information sharing with other government agencies? 4.4 Is there any commercial information that should be subject to additional protections? 57 A fusion centre involves agencies working together to share resources and intelligence to deliver better outcomes. The aim is to create a holistic end-to-end view of particular issues (such as organised crime) and then apply the appropriate interventions (for example, deciding which legislation is appropriate to use). 58 Sections 27(1)(c), 29(1)(a) and 29(1)(b) of the Privacy Act, and see also sections 6(c) and 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act. 59 Public attitudes to the sharing of personal information in the course of online service provision Lips, Eppel, Cunningham & Hopkins-Burns, 2010. 54 To modernise the tax administration, the Government wants to improve the delivery of digital services, expand withholding tax mechanisms, pre-populate income tax returns for individuals and make greater use of a business’s existing financial systems to automate interactions with Inland Revenue. These features have implications for the obligations and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents. Taxpayer self-assessment is a key feature of New Zealand’s tax administration. An assessment, which determines the final amount of tax payable, is a critical part of the tax collection function and underpins the role taxpayers and tax agents have in tax administration. The discussion below considers the assessment system, and the current and future responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents in making an assessment. The assessmenT An assessment is often the trigger point for a wide range of compliance and administrative actions by Inland Revenue. Depending on how the assessment system operates, the roles summary Of prOpOsals Taxpayers who receive a pre- populated tax return would have an obligation to respond to that return. The required response by a taxpayer to a pre-populated tax return would be to either confirm the return is a complete and accurate record of their tax affairs, or provide further adjustment information. Taxpayers who receive a pre- populated tax return would be required to assess their own liability, and the confirmation of this return, with or without further adjustment information, would be their self-assessment. If taxpayers who receive a pre- populated return do not make an assessment, Inland Revenue would be able to make a default assessment. cHapter 5 tHe role of taxpayers & tax agents 55 and responsibilities of taxpayers and tax agents in making an assessment can vary. Taxpayer self-assessment reflects the fact that a taxpayer has the relevant information and is often in the best position to determine their tax liability.60 Self-assessment means taxpayers are responsible for: • considering the facts relating to their own financial affairs; • interpreting and applying the law to those facts; • determining the amount of tax owing; and • making that determination with an appropriate degree of finality. Not all of these responsibilities are explicitly stated in the legislation, but they are inherent in taxpayers’ obligations to determine their tax liability. A self-assessment tax system generally provides an efficient basis for tax collection and should continue, because taxpayers have the information that is likely to result in the most accurate assessment. Self-assessment allows Inland Revenue to put its resources to best use. This means balancing resources between processing and checking the correctness of assessments, carrying out taxpayer audits and helping taxpayers to meet their obligations. We next consider how the assessment obligations may change for taxpayers who are issued with a pre-populated tax return or who are using software that automates business interactions with Inland Revenue. pre-pOpulaTed Tax reTurns fOr individuals To make it easier for people to meet their tax obligations, the Government proposes that individuals receive income tax returns pre-populated t a x s e c r e c y r o l e o f t H e c o M M i s s i o n e r r o l e o f t a x a g e n t s r o l e o f t H e t a x p a y e r tax adMinistration act i n f o r M a t i o n c o l l e c t i o n 56 with information that Inland Revenue holds or sources from reliable third- parties. Pre-populating income tax returns could reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and can be an effective compliance response to some taxpayers omitting or under-reporting income. Many OECD countries now pre- populate income tax returns.61 For example, the Australian Tax Office has, since 2007, added information received for compliance purposes from third parties, directly to the relevant tax return. In the United Kingdom, taxpayers when filing a return online, see certain pre- populated data that HMRC holds. In moving to greater pre-population, several questions arise, including who files tax returns, the point in time when an assessment occurs, and the obligations of taxpayers that underpin these actions. The specific nature of the information that could be pre- populated and who would be issued with a pre-populated return will likely be considered in a later discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals. Filing of tax returns Filing a tax return and making an assessment are key parts of a taxpayer’s obligation to pay the correct amount of tax on time. However, not all individuals are currently required to file tax returns. The personal tax summary (PTS) was introduced in 2000 and removed the requirement to file a tax return for individuals who earned income solely from salaries, wages, dividends and interest. The PTS provides a simplified means for some individuals to reconcile their affairs. A PTS is issued by Inland Revenue and shows gross income, taxes deducted and any refund or payment due. Before the PTS was introduced, about 1.2 million taxpayers were required to complete an end-of-year tax return. It was envisaged that changes to the square-up process would reduce the number of taxpayers needing to file a return. The PTS system was originally designed so that the great majority of taxpayers would be freed from the annual obligation to square-up their tax affairs. There are now growing numbers of taxpayers who are filing returns, or otherwise interacting with Inland Revenue, including individuals filing a donations rebate form or those that have in excess of $200 of interest or dividends with tax incorrectly withheld. Likewise, Inland Revenue’s growing involvement in the delivery of social policies, such as Working for Families tax credits, has also substantially increased the number of taxpayers who file or interact with Inland Revenue. 57 Tax return pre-population is one measure which can help to achieve the goal of simplifying taxpayer interactions with Inland Revenue. By pre-populating income tax returns, Inland Revenue could offer a more personalised and simpler return process. Furthermore, tax returns should be more accurate as the opportunity for error would be minimised. In turn, this should reduce the resources needed to correct simple errors. Information Inland Revenue will populate While there are practical limits to the completeness and accuracy of information that can be populated by Inland Revenue, it could be expected that Inland Revenue would add more than just information about PAYE or other taxes withheld at source to a pre-populated tax return. For some types of income, the comprehensiveness of third-party information could allow income figures to be added to the return. For other types of income, third-party information may only allow Inland Revenue to personalise the prompts for further information to be added. As noted already, the specific nature of the information that could be pre- populated is likely to be considered in a later discussion document on improving the tax system for individuals. Individuals will be issued with a pre- populated return It is likely that only individuals with an IRD number would be issued with a pre-populated return. Currently it is not compulsory for every individual to have an IRD number and this is not expected to change. However, an IRD number would be needed for Inland The following graph shows the number of individuals filing income tax returns or PTSs from the years 2000 to 2013. 200,000 2000 20 012002200320042005200620072008200920102 0112 0122 013 0 400,000 600,000 800,000 1,000,000 1,200,000 1,400,000 1,600,000 1,800,000 individual Taxpayers – number Of Taxpayers non-filers have to file choose to file 58 Revenue to pre-populate a tax return because it is an essential data point that enables information-matching. In Australia, a Tax File Number (TFN) is the equivalent of the New Zealand IRD number. Although it is not mandatory for taxpayers to register for a TFN, taxpayers who do not register for a TFN cannot lodge their tax returns electronically or obtain an Australian Business Number. While digital channels are the most effective way of delivering pre-populated returns, the Government’s vision for the delivery of digital services incudes providing alternatives for taxpayers that cannot manage their transactions digitally. Taxpayers who cannot manage their transactions digitally may still receive a pre-populated return. For these taxpayers it may not be possible to effectively replicate all of the features of a digital pre-populated return in non-digital channels. Obligations of a taxpayer issued with a pre-populated return A taxpayer’s response to a pre- populated return would be a proxy for the four elements of an assessment as outlined above. Therefore taxpayers would continue to be responsible for interpreting and applying the law to the facts relating to their own financial affairs. It is proposed that a taxpayer issued with a pre-populated return must respond to that return within a prescribed period. If a pre-populated tax return provides a complete and accurate record of the taxpayer’s affairs, the required response would be confirmation that the return is correct. In other situations the taxpayer may need to add further information, or amend the pre- populated information so that the correct net loss, terminal tax or refund due is calculated. The obligation to respond within a prescribed period would be similar to the current obligation to file an income tax return by no later than the prescribed date. It is likely that the period would be informed by the extent to which information could be pre-populated and would take account of the time third parties needed to supply the information to Inland Revenue that was used for pre- population. The date on which Inland Revenue receives a taxpayer’s response would be treated as the date the assessment is made. This is because that date would be the first time Inland Revenue and the taxpayer were aware that the tax liability, as determined by the taxpayer, is intended to be final. In a digital environment, Inland Revenue could immediately notify the taxpayer of the point in time when the response had been received and the assessment therefore made. failure to respond to a pre-populated return If Inland Revenue issued a pre- populated return but no response was received, it is important that there is still an assessment. As noted, an assessment is the usual trigger 59 assessment has been issued, the onus is on the taxpayer to establish that the default assessment issued by Inland Revenue is wrong and by how much. Due to the methods used, a default assessment may result in a tax liability that is slightly higher than a self- assessment. In these circumstances a default assessment may encourage taxpayers to confirm or amend their assessment. The default assessment by its nature cannot be expected to be completely accurate. Despite this, the default assessment approach is preferred because it provides Inland Revenue with a tool to address non-compliance by creating better incentives for taxpayers to respond to their pre-populated return. overwriting information on a pre- populated return There are practical limits to the completeness and accuracy of pre-populated returns generated by Inland Revenue. It is therefore necessary to decide whether some pre-populated information should be “locked” so it cannot be overwritten, or if it is better to allow taxpayers to amend all pre-populated information. In Australia and the United Kingdom, information that has been pre- populated can be amended by a taxpayer during the return-filing process. If pre-populated information can be amended while responding to a return, the benefit pre-populated returns offer as a compliance tool may be reduced, and administrative costs could be increased depending on the process adopted for verifying taxpayer point for penalties, and a wide range of compliance and administrative actions. Two approaches have been considered for ensuring there is an assessment if Inland Revenue receives no response to a pre-populated return. The choice involves a trade-off between administrative costs and the effects on compliance. The first approach is a system of “deemed acceptance”. This approach would mean when no response is received within the prescribed period, the taxpayer would be considered to have made an assessment in accordance with the pre-populated return. It is unclear, however, how the criteria for making an assessment could reconcile with deeming a taxpayer to have made an assessment. In many cases, no consideration may have been given by a taxpayer as to whether the pre-populated information was a complete and accurate reflection of their individual circumstances. Deeming the acceptance of a pre-populated return may not, therefore, create the right incentives for taxpayers to respond to Inland Revenue when they have income that is not pre-populated. Whether this is a significant issue will likely depend on the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the pre-populated return. The second approach would be to allow Inland Revenue to make a “default assessment”. A default assessment is an estimation of tax liability made by Inland Revenue that remains in place until the individual files the return. After a default 60 amendments. Making it too difficult to amend pre-populated figures could have undesirable consequences. For example, it could mean: • taxpayers are over reliant on the figures provided; • taxpayers do not pursue the correction of genuine errors; • additional compliance costs for taxpayers (and potentially information providers); and • an increased revenue risk through additional undeclared income. There is therefore a trade-off between the administrative costs and the benefit pre-population offers as a compliance tool. In some instances Inland Revenue may need to make some assumptions about a taxpayer’s individual circumstances to allow information to be pre-populated. As taxpayers are ultimately responsible in a self-assessment system for the assessments they make, it is suggested that all pre-populated return information is able to be overwritten during the return-filing process. To ensure taxpayers are aware of their self-assessment responsibilities as more pre-populated information becomes available, it would be made clear that taxpayers are responsible for the accuracy of their assessment, and that penalties for underpayment and certain types of error or other behaviour can still apply. This is consistent with equivalent approaches taken in Australia and the United Kingdom to pre-populating tax return information for individuals. 61 TechnOlOgy and assessmenTs fOr small businesses To make it easier for small businesses to comply with their tax obligations, the Government is considering various options, including ways to encourage the use of improved business systems and accounting software that meets specific standards. These options focus on systems being designed in a way that gives both Inland Revenue and taxpayers comfort that the right amount of tax has been determined and paid. Businesses would benefit as these options could: • reduce the number of errors by assisting taxpayers to classify transactions; • reduce taxpayer effort by aligning Inland Revenue information requirements with a taxpayer’s normal business processes; and • simplify interactions with Inland Revenue by automating the supply of information. Software that can automate the supply of information to Inland Revenue may mean that “returns” in the traditional sense are no longer required for some businesses. However, even with business systems that can automatically supply information to Inland Revenue throughout a period, there will likely need to be a point in time at which a business’s assessment is treated as made. Therefore a business may be required to confirm the aggregate final figures in order to trigger the assessment. Confirming the aggregate final figures is a proxy for a business having interpreted and applied the law to the facts relating to their own financial affairs, and shows an intention that the amount of tax determined is final. Any final withholding-type taxes would provide an exception to this approach. Options for improving the tax system for small businesses are being considered and may be included in a subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion document. The rOle Of Tax agenTs About 5,300 tax agents are registered with Inland Revenue and they manage the tax affairs of nearly two million clients. Tax agents range from individual bookkeepers working from home, to large businesses that offer consulting and accounting services. The advice and assistance tax agents give their clients contributes significantly to the smooth running of the tax system. While features of the modernised tax administration suggest the nature of the support agents provide may change, tax agents are expected to continue to have a key role in compliance outcomes. Recognising the role of tax agents Clients place a high degree of trust in the services of tax agents. Many tax agents are also members of professional bodies and associations, whose brand gives a client comfort the agent has an appropriate standard 62 inland revenue ta x agents ta xpayers 12 34 tax agents Manage tHeir clients': • relationship with Inland Revenue • tax affairs • compliance needs 1 inland revenue provides: • access to clients’ information • tax agent services 2 tax agents provide: • advice on how to comply • education on tax law for specific transactions • assistance to clients with compliance matters 3 ta xpayers: • provide information • seek advice 4 63 of skill and experience. A client can have greater confidence they are paying the right amount of tax when the advice and support a tax agent provides is based on complete information using the agent’s expertise in tax law and practice. Using a tax agent allows a taxpayer to focus their time and resources on their business. Some of the ways tax agents assist their clients to comply with their tax obligations include: • helping with the requirements for setting up a business; • providing on-going transactional tax and accounting advice; • advising on the nature and quality of records required to be kept; • ensuring clients meet their filing and paying obligations; • educating clients on specific areas of law and administrative requirements; and • taking responsibility for managing correspondence and interactions with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue recognises the important role of tax agents by providing support and special services. For example, all tax agents have an agent account manager who serves as the primary contact with Inland Revenue. A dedicated telephone service provides tax agents with a convenient channel for communicating with Inland Revenue, and myIR provides tax agents with a range of online self-service options that allow tax agents to manage their clients’ taxes quickly and easily. In addition, tax agents are provided with an extended period of time in which to file their clients’ income tax returns. To be eligible for this extension of time, a person must prepare income tax returns for 10 or more taxpayers, and be: • a practitioner carrying on a professional public practice; • a person carrying on a business or occupation in which annual returns of income are prepared; or • a Māori Trustee. The broad range of eligible persons for the extension of time recognises the important role of tax agents and allows them to better manage their clients’ tax affairs. An eligible person will be listed as a tax agent unless this would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Occasionally Inland Revenue may have concerns about a particular applicant’s suitability to be a tax agent or about existing tax agents or key office holders. To maintain the integrity of the tax system, Inland Revenue may refuse to list a tax agent, or can remove them from the list of tax agents. The removal of entities from the list of tax agents is infrequent and the number of declined applications is low. This is not expected to change. Consideration has been given to whether more regulated tax agent rules such as Australia’s would 64 be beneficial to New Zealand. On balance, it appears that any tax integrity benefit would be outweighed by higher compliance and administrative costs. Enhancing access to Inland Revenue tax agent services The definition of a “tax agent” used for determining who can have an extension of time for filing is also used for determining who can access the services Inland Revenue provides to tax agents. This means that other tax service providers, for example, those only filing GST and PAYE returns for clients, are not able to access these services. While these providers can still look after the tax affairs of clients under the nominated person process, the additional services Inland Revenue provides to them is limited. Modernising the tax system provides Inland Revenue with the opportunity to allow other tax service providers to access the broader range of services currently only available to those that meet the definition of a tax agent. To achieve this, legislative change may not be needed. Tax agents’ role in modernising the tax administration Modernising the tax system will require change over a number of years. Tax agents will have a key role in enabling their clients to benefit from the new features of the tax administration. These changes may allow tax agents to spend less time on routine processes and more time on other services. For example, it could mean focusing on ensuring that businesses are inputting the correct information and that their systems are appropriate, and that clients are educated on how to navigate new processes. Improving the delivery of digital services could mean tax agents have better access to the information Inland Revenue holds about their clients, and any actions Inland Revenue is taking. These improvements and other changes may provide increased opportunity for tax agents to work in “real time”, reducing end-of-year work pressures. In the future this could mean the extension of time for tax agents becomes less relevant. The need to carefully review information and make sure it is accurate will become even more critical as information collection is streamlined. The opportunity for tax agents to influence compliance outcomes is broader than income tax filing and payment compliance. Advice on how tax law applies to client circumstances will remain an important part of tax agents’ services. In this regard it will be important to consider the increase in cross-border transactions, in part facilitated by new technologies, which enables more businesses to enter international markets. key quesTiOns fOr readers 5.1 Will pre-populated tax returns make it easier for people to meet their tax obligations? 5.2 For taxpayers receiving pre- populated returns do you agree with the proposed process for outlining the related obligations and responsibilities? 5.3 If the supply of regular information is automated through the use of business accounting systems, will the time at which the aggregate final figures are confirmed be an appropriate point of self-assessment? 5.4 For tax agents using Inland Revenue’s current service offering, what services do you consider most important to facilitate your role in advising and assisting clients? 5.5 What sort of services would you like to see Inland Revenue make available to tax agents or other tax service providers in the modern tax administration? 5.6 What would you want considered in designing more digital service offerings for tax agents and other tax service providers? 60 See Legislating for self-assessment, a government discussion document, August 1998. 61 OECD, Tax Administration 2013 Comparative Information on OECD and Other Advanced and Emerging Economies 2013, Paris, OECD. 65 A quicker more efficient tax administration requires a look at some of the tax system’s key regimes and underpinning rules in the Tax Administration Act. This chapter considers the advice and disputes regimes, the time bar, record- keeping requirements, and the future compliance and penalties approach. In all of these areas analysis will be followed by consultation once key features of the modernised tax administration have been decided and implemented. advice and dispuTes prOcedures The proposals on the future assessment approach in the last chapter will necessitate some change to the disputes and binding rulings procedures, but the degree of change is still to be determined. In considering any changes, an important consideration will be the need for the tax system to focus on speed, accuracy and predictability in business taxation matters. The avenues for taxpayers to seek advice from Inland Revenue, and procedures for resolving disputes, are essential mechanisms that impact these objectives. Options available for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view In a self-assessment system taxpayers need to ascertain their tax positions with reasonable certainty. Inland Revenue supports individuals and businesses to meet their obligations by providing information, reminders, self-assessment tools, online services and advice. In providing advice to taxpayers, Inland Revenue must balance taxpayers’ obligations to self-assess against its role in protecting the integrity of the tax system by ensuring consistency and certainty. A key constraint in determining the balance is that Inland Revenue will never have sufficient resources to advise all taxpayers about the implications of every transaction or income source. The provision of advice is therefore prioritised and streamlined for different contexts and to different audiences – for example, specific taxpayers and for the wider public. Inland Revenue provides advice to the wider public by publishing interpretation statements, interpretation guidelines, public cHapter 6 future issues 66 rulings, Questions We’ve Been Asked, Agents Answers, Business Tax Updates and other guides to assist taxpayers with their obligations. More specific advice is provided by Inland Revenue community compliance officers. This service is free to any individual or organisation in business, anyone considering setting up in business, sports clubs and other non-profit bodies. Some advice can also be sought through Inland Revenue’s call centres. Modernising the tax administration will mean simplifying and automating many processes. However, the nature of tax means there will be matters where: • the law (or advice on the law) is unclear and there is more than one possible interpretation; • new legislation applies and requires a new process or response; • a transaction is novel, sensitive or controversial; • an arrangement raises significant financial issues or has a wide impact; or • the arrangement involves a complex transaction. In these situations taxpayers may require more specific advice, particularly before providing their self-assessment. Giving this specific advice is an important part of the role of tax agents, tax advisors and other professional advisors. However, seeking Inland Revenue’s view on an issue should afford a taxpayer some additional certainty. As Inland Revenue must administer the tax system with limited resources, allocating these to providing specific advice can mean directing resources away from compliance activities. On the other hand, giving this advice can also encourage better compliance. Options for a taxpayer to seek advice from Inland Revenue (other than straightforward advice) include seeking a binding ruling or requesting non-binding informal advice. Each of these options has limitations. The binding rulings regime represents a balance between a desire to provide an efficient service to taxpayers that will enhance business certainty, and the need to provide adequate protection for the revenue base. The cost, the disclosure requirements and the restricted situations in which Inland Revenue can (or will) rule limits the number of taxpayers that may benefit from seeking a private ruling. A more informal option is non-binding advice. One type of non-binding advice is Inland Revenue’s indicative view. An indicative view provides the taxpayer with an “initial reaction” to any concerns or potential areas that may be contested in respect of an arrangement or tax position. The indicative view is normally only available to larger taxpayers when a binding ruling cannot be given or when the arrangement is in its very early stages (or other legally non- binding stage). They may be sought because an arrangement in the 67 early stages may change materially. Indicative views are not ordinarily available on matters of tax avoidance or overly complex transactions or issues. In limited circumstances a taxpayer may seek to clarify how the law applies by initiating a dispute through the use of a taxpayer initiated notice of proposed adjustment. It is questionable whether using the disputes process in this way is efficient, as the disputes process starts to apply even if there is no genuine dispute and Inland Revenue will, at any point in time, be unaware of when the process is planned to be used. To guide future considerations, the Government seeks feedback on whether the current options for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view on specific issues are working effectively and, if not, the Government welcomes reader’s views on how these products may be improved to better meet future needs. It is important that feedback takes account of the wider business transformation objectives, including proposals around the time bar and penalties. Time bar An important part of Inland Revenue’s role in a tax system based on self-assessment is to carry out checks to ensure the correctness of assessments made by taxpayers. In the modernised tax administration Inland Revenue’s role is expected to increase in the period before a taxpayer makes an assessment. It will involve, for example, pre-populating tax returns for individual taxpayers and building compliance measures into a business’s natural systems. However, post-assessment activities, including investigations, will continue to be a crucial part of Inland Revenue’s role in protecting the integrity of the tax system. When an assessment is incorrect it can be amended by Inland Revenue to increase the amount of tax until the end of the period known as the “time bar”. The period chosen for the time bar attempts to balance the obligation of taxpayers to assess the correct amount of tax with the need for finality. Finality is desirable given the important and sometimes complex nature of tax, the need to keep records, and the consequences for a taxpayer, which may result from the failure to discharge their obligations. For the Government, the desirability and advantage of finality is in providing the right balance between enforcement and future compliance. The current time bar mostly stops Inland Revenue from being able to amend an income tax or GST assessment to increase the amount of tax if four years have passed from the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer provided the tax return. To maintain fairness, there are some exceptions to this rule. This four-year fixed-period approach is relatively simple; taxpayers and Inland Revenue generally know when finality will be achieved. The disadvantage of the current fixed-period approach, however, is that it does not allow compliant taxpayers to achieve finality sooner. 68 A similar limitation applies to the refunding of overpayments of tax. Any changes to the time bar for decreasing the amount of tax would be considered at the same time as changes to the time bar for increasing tax. An alternative approach to the time bar The proposed features of the modernised tax administration, including increased use of technology in pre-populating tax returns for individuals, information matching and better compliance profiling may give Inland Revenue a higher degree of comfort that a return is correct. Once these features are implemented, the Government could consider a change in approach. Options could include a reduced time period for Inland Revenue to make an enquiry or a reduced time bar in situations where Inland Revenue was comfortable that returns were very likely to be materially correct. These approaches will allow Inland Revenue to focus available resources on collecting the highest net revenue practicable over time. The Government seeks feedback on the desirability of a change in approach that reflects what Inland Revenue may be able to determine in the modernised tax administration about a taxpayer’s likely compliance. As noted, it is only once features of the modernised tax administration are implemented, that the Government could consider a change in approach. recOrd-keeping requiremenTs The main record-keeping requirement for businesses is that records must be kept for seven years after the end of the income year or GST period to which they relate. Inland Revenue may require records to be retained for up to three additional years if an audit or investigation is being conducted or actively considered. The record-keeping legislative requirements could, in the future, be updated to reflect the costs of keeping records in a digital environment, and that Inland Revenue may have more information from interacting with business systems. In updating the record-keeping requirements there is a question of whether the current time-periods for keeping records would be suitable in the future and whether, for example, they could be aligned with the time bar, including any revised time bar. Any changes would need to take account of other non-tax record-keeping obligations imposed on businesses. cOmpliance and penalTies Tax compliance means people pay the correct amount of tax and receive the entitlements they should. For those that do not comply with their payment obligations it is important that consequences are in keeping with the severity of the actions in question. The illustration below shows the “triangle” compliance model Inland Revenue has used to determine how to respond to various levels of compliance and non-compliance. The “triangle” compliance model 69 was introduced in 2001. It was new thinking then, and moved Inland Revenue from a largely enforcement- based approach to a service- orientated approach. The “triangle” model takes account of taxpayer attitudes and how Inland Revenue should respond, and recognises that most taxpayers are compliant. Shortfall penalties are imposed when a required standard of behaviour has not been met. Modernising the tax system provides an opportunity to recognise that taxpayer behaviour is about more than attitude. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour. Inland Revenue needs to think more widely about taxpayer needs and behaviours, and start building an environment that supports taxpayers right from the start. To support this, a new compliance model has been developed that emphasises the fact that Inland Revenue’s approach is not prescriptive and needs to be tailored for each taxpayer. The new compliance model is made up of moveable wheels that show how Inland Revenue should be flexible and adaptive. At the centre of the new compliance model is the customer and what forms their behaviour. The middle wheel shows the five key principles of the new compliance model. The outer wheel shows the seven activities Inland Revenue uses to build compliance. Have decided not to comply Use full force of the law Deter by detection Assist to comply Make it easy Attitude to complianceCompliance strategy lOw high Don't want to comply Try to, but don't succeed Willing to do the right thing level of compliance costs Factors that influence customer decisions and behaviour Psychological SociologicalEconomic IndustryBusiness Create pressure down Customer 70 The new approach to compliance could mean a different approach to penalties. Further analysis of this important area may be included in a subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion document. key quesTiOns fOr readers Are the current options for taxpayers to seek Inland Revenue’s view on specific issues working effectively? If not, what are your views on how the provision of advice may be improved, taking into account any limitation on Inland Revenue’s resources? What suggestions do you have for how the time bar and record- keeping period rules could be developed in the modernised tax administration? 71 Australia In Australia, it is an offence to disclose “protected information”, being information obtained under a tax law that relates to the affairs of, or identifies an entity.62 The information must have been obtained as a “taxation officer”. The Australian secrecy rule is subject to a wide range of exceptions, which permit disclosures in the course of performing duties, to Ministers, to various specified government departments and for law enforcement purposes. Consent of the entity to which the information relates is not a defence to prosecution for disclosure. However, it is not an offence to disclose when the information was already available to the public. The Australian legislation also contains rules about disclosure of protected information by persons who are not taxation officers. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, revenue and customs officers may not disclose information held by HMRC in connection with the functions of HMRC.63 This rule is subject to a public interest disclosure rule and a rule regarding disclosure to prosecuting authorities. Disclosure is also permitted for functions of HMRC, for civil or criminal proceedings (relating to revenue or customs), on the order of a court, and with the consent of the taxpayer concerned. Revenue or customs information that specifies the person’s identity or would allow their identity to be deduced is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Otherwise, information protected by the secrecy rule is not exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Canada In Canada, information collection and disclosure is regulated at both the federal and provincial levels. Of primary relevance, the federal Income Tax Act provides that officials may not disclose or use taxpayer information other than in the course of the administration or enforcement of the Income Tax Act or certain other legislation.64 “Taxpayer information” is appendix tax secrecy in otHer Jurisdictions 72 defined as information relating to one or more taxpayers but not including information that does not directly or indirectly reveal the identity of the taxpayer to whom it relates.65 There are a significant number of exceptions to the non-disclosure rule. These include disclosure when there is imminent danger of death or injury to an individual, disclosure to government or provincial officials for policy formulation or evaluation, administration or enforcement of various acts (generally relating to entitlements or savings), in relation to debts to the Crown, and when required by certain (specified) other Acts. Information may also be disclosed if the taxpayer concerned has consented to the disclosure. United States In the United States, the debate over whether tax privacy promotes individual compliance has been described as “as old as the income tax itself”.66 Today, the federal government is prevented from publicly releasing the details of any specific taxpayer’s return or audit history, unless the taxpayer consents.67 The US Code protects “returns” and “return information”, both of which are defined. A “return” is a tax or information return, declaration of estimated tax or claim for a refund. “Return information” is a much broader class of information about a taxpayer, including their identity, income, deductions, credits, and their audit and penalty history. It does not however, include information in a form which cannot be associated with, or otherwise (directly or indirectly) identify a particular taxpayer. As with the other jurisdictions considered, there are a range of legislative exceptions to the general rule. Many of these relate to tax administration purposes, but non-tax purposes are also included, such as locating fugitives for use in criminal investigations to intelligence agencies in relation to applications under Federal loan programmes, and certain Medicare purposes. In addition, while it is not done at the federal level, some state tax authorities publish online the detail of “delinquent taxpayers” (individuals and corporates) who have outstanding tax liabilities.68 Finland In some other countries, for example Finland, the position is somewhat different. While tax secrecy rules still exist in Finland, protecting tax documents concerning a taxpayer’s financial position and other tax documents containing information on an identifiable taxpayer, lists of all individual taxpayers and their income are published annually.69 Certain information regarding the taxation affairs of corporations is also public, including their taxable income and property, total amount of taxes imposed, total amount of withholding tax, and the amount to be levied or refunded in the course of tax collection. 62 Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) Schedule 1, Chapter 5, Division 355. 63 Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005, section 18. 64 Income Tax Act, RSC 1985, c1 (5th Supp) section 241(1). 65 As above, section 241(10). 66 Blank, J.D. “USA”, in Kristofferson, Lang, Pistone, Schuch, Staringer, Storck (eds.), Tax secrecy and tax transparency: the relevance of confidentiality in tax law, Peter Lang Publishing, 2 013 , p116 3 . 67 26 USC § 6103. 68 See, for example, Vermont http://www.state.vt.us/tax/ delinquenttaxpayers.shtml; Wisconsin http://www.revenue.wi.gov/html/delqlist.html; New York http://www.tax.ny.gov/enforcement/delinquent\_ taxpayers\_individuals.pdf. 69 Aima, K & Hellsten, K, “Finland”, in Kristofferson, Lang, Pistone, Schuch, Staringer, Storck (eds.), Tax secrecy and tax transparency: the relevance of confidentiality in tax law, Peter Lang Publishing, 2013, p404. 73
Whether you are paying tax, receiving payments such as Working for Families or benefiting from government spending on health, education or welfare, we all have a vested interest in making sure our tax system works well. A good tax system has two building blocks: good tax policy, which provides a solid foundation of tax law, and a good tax administration system, which makes it easy for taxpayers to understand the law, pay their taxes and receive their correct entitlements. The Government wants to ensure that the way we administer the tax system works for you and that it will continue to do so in the future. The tax system reflects a large number of policy decisions that have been made over many years. We need to modernise tax administration to cut the costs to taxpayers of complying with the tax system, and the costs to the government of administering the system. This consultation paper, Making tax simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act looks at our current tax administration system set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and how we might make it simpler for everyone and more flexible for the future. It looks at the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, to ensure that her resources and those of taxpayers are used most efficiently. It also considers what the right balance should be between keeping taxpayer information secret and using that information more efficiently to provide better services to New Zealanders. And it looks at other questions we need to consider as part of our wider vision to improve our tax administration system. I want to hear your views on the ideas proposed for our future tax administration system. Please have your say, because it is important for all of us to have a tax system that is efficient, fair and flexible for the future. makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz TOWARDS A NEW TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT MAKING TAX SIMPLER Hon Todd McClay MINISTER OF REVENUE Tax administration refers to the rules and processes which govern how Inland Revenue should operate when collecting and distributing tax and other payments. The effectiveness of these rules and processes is just as important for maintaining fairness in the tax system as the rules defining how much tax is due. Achieving our goal of developing a better, more resilient and responsive tax system for New Zealand involves more than simply updating the computer system. We have taken the opportunity to look at the way tax is administered to determine what needs to change to meet the challenges of the 21st century. To ensure the tax system can support the Government’s wider objectives, including the delivery of better public services, changes are proposed to: • clarify the Commissioner’s “care and management” responsibilities to allow for more administrative flexibility in limited circumstances in applying the law, and clarify how the responsibilities apply to the non-tax functions such as administration of student loans and Working for Families; • clarify Inland Revenue’s ability to access remotely stored information and bulk third-party information while maintaining the requirement that information collected must be necessary and relevant to administering tax; • update the current secrecy rule – which restrains the use of tax specific information – from covering all tax information to just information that identifies, or could identify a taxpayer; CONSULTATION TIMELINE #makingtaxsimpler makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz • consider whether taxpayers should be able to consent to the release of their information in certain circumstances; • establish the self-assessment mechanisms when pre-population and automated supply of information through accounting systems is introduced; • introduce rules to clarify what an individual or small business has to do if they receive a pre-populated tax return or if they supply information to Inland Revenue automatically through their accounting system. In addition to the specific proposals, feedback is sought on: • how information could better be shared across government on the basis that commercially sensitive information would continue to be protected; • how the smarter use of technology may assist tax agents in their role and how this role may change in the future; • what else could change in the future administration as we progress with Making Tax Simpler, including the rules governing disputes and advice, the time bar and record keeping. HAVE YOUR SAY Go to makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz to find out more about these proposals and to have your say. These proposals require changes to the legislation. If the proposals are passed by Parliament, Inland Revenue will communicate the changes well in advance of them coming into effect. Consultation is open until Friday 12 February 2016.

The opening of the New Zealand and world economies, the explosion of digital technologies, changing work structures and relationships, and new levels of consumer-driven change have fundamentally altered how businesses and other organisations operate. New Zealanders have been quick to take up the benefits of digital technologies. Systems such as EFTPOS have become almost universal. We have had one of the highest rates of mobile phone ownership in the world for many years. Internet use is a normal part of doing business for most, broadband subscriptions continue to rise, and consumption of mobile data is rapidly increasing. Issues around the “digital divide” still exist, however. There is some evidence that the digital divide is easing as prices become more competitive, and more intuitive services are introduced. It is acknowledged however that digital access is not universal – for example, some rural areas still lack access to broadband internet services. the waY the tax sYstem Operates has tO change InternatIonal exposure changing approach to work Technology The waY people do Things has changed chapTer 1 overview 6 When there are benefits and a positive experience, businesses and consumers have shown their willingness to use software to undertake previously manual tasks and to use digital communication channels. There has been a rapid increase in the use of payroll and business software and in customers’ use of online channels for consumer and financial transactions, including with the public sector. This change is also taking place in the context of tax administration. People are rapidly adopting Inland Revenue’s digital channels1 : • Already 63 percent of employer monthly schedules containing pay as you earn (PAYE) information are submitted digitally. • More than 64 percent of goods and services tax (GST) submissions are made through digital channels. • 89 percent of individual tax returns are made online. With rapid uptake, the primary challenge is to ensure that new digital services are well designed, well promoted, and deliver tangible benefits for all parties. The Government is responding to and leading this shift through a range of responses, including the rollout of ultra-fast broadband, Better Public Services targets, which include reducing the cost for businesses of interacting with government by 25 percent by 2017, and the design of customer focussed digital channels. The transformation of tax administration in New Zealand is a comprehensive response to these wider changes, based on bringing tax systems into the modern digital world. The Government’s Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper) and discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Better digital services (Better digital services) released in March 2015 set out its ideas for modernising New Zealand’s tax administration, and identified the major role of digital technology in making tax simpler for New Zealanders. The Government’s proposals to modernise the way tax is administered involve far more than just updating Inland Revenue’s computer system. This discussion document builds on the ideas in the Green Paper and the Better digital services discussion document with specific proposals to design digital services which will, as much as possible, integrate tax requirements into tasks people would already be doing to run their business or organisation. The Green Paper proposed that changes would be considered and introduced in a number of discrete steps. This discussion document is about how the Government proposes to improve the administration of PAYE and GST. The Green Paper identified the likely scope of the review of PAYE and GST processes and the PAYE rules. Most, but not all, of these issues are addressed in this document, some are 77 still under consideration and others will be included in subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion documents. The proposals in this discussion document provide the opportunity for: • Customers to meet their tax obligations at the time they are doing their normal business – for example, submitting GST information direct from their accounting package or meeting PAYE obligations at the time they pay wages or salaries. • Inland Revenue to use PAYE information more effectively to support existing social policy processes. • Government to subsequently redesign social policies – for example, by introducing shorter periods of assessment to better match assistance to periods of need. This document does not propose a timetable for changes to the way PAYE and GST are administered. Inland Revenue has recently begun work to determine the recommended approach to sequencing changes across the system. Until the Government has considered the recommended approach and made decisions it is not possible to outline a timetable. The Government expects to have made sufficient progress with planning, however, to introduce legislation in 2016. paYe and gst backgrOund Together GST and PAYE account for 67 percent of tax revenue2. PAYE is a withholding tax mechanism used by New Zealand employers (or PAYE intermediaries) to deduct income tax and the ACC earners’ levy from their employees’ salaries and wages and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. The PAYE system is also used to collect payments and information for many income-related social policies. The information employers are required to provide in an employer monthly schedule is referred to in this document as PAYE information. GST is a consumption tax on most goods and services supplied in New Zealand. It is collected by GST-registered persons from their customers on behalf of the Government. The Government has the objective of minimising the costs of PAYE and GST processes - for customers and for government. There are also problems with the quality and timeliness of PAYE information, which impose costs on employers and Inland Revenue and limit the Government’s ability to provide effective social services. A Government priority is the delivery of better public services. This includes making it easier for businesses to deal with government so they spend less effort on administration and have more time to focus on their customers. Improving the quality of information held is also central to 88 a trade-off to be made between simplicity and withholding accuracy. • Whether the tax treatment of holiday pay should be clarified by legislation or administratively by an Inland Revenue publication. • Whether a mechanism should be introduced to improve the accuracy of PAYE withholding in years in which an extra pay day will occur. • Whether legislated rate changes should be applied in the same way across PAYE-related tax types/ products. Modernising how PAYE information is provided Integrating PAYE obligations with business processes, and providing information to Inland Revenue at the same time, could improve some PAYE processes and eliminate others. This discussion document asks for feedback on the possible changes, which include: • simplifying the KiwiSaver enrolment process; • modernising how employers are informed of employee deductions; • modernising procedures for supplying and amending PAYE information; and • changes which could eliminate the need to file nil employer monthly schedule returns. agencies achieving the Government’s priorities. To help deliver on these priorities Inland Revenue is working with third parties, including software providers, so that they can design digital services that will integrate tax requirements into normal business practices. summarY Of prOpOsals: paYe This discussion document proposes that new digital services could be used to: • Minimise the costs to employers of providing PAYE information, by integrating the process of submitting information to Inland Revenue with the business processes that the employer undertakes for its own purposes (such as adding an employee to the payroll and running the payroll). • Submit PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process is run and, by doing so, improve the timeliness and usefulness of the information. At the same time the Government is also consulting on some potential changes to the PAYE rules to improve their overall workability. Modernising the PAYE rules This discussion document asks the following questions: • Whether the method for determining the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay should be changed. There is 9 year. This change would increase the percentage of employers required to file digitally from 11 percent to 22 percent. Every month employers provide information about PAYE-related deductions made during the previous month. Because timely, accurate PAYE information is important to the delivery of income-related social policies, the Government is considering whether it should require employers to provide PAYE information on a different basis. The Government is therefore consulting on proposals to replace the current obligation to enable or, depending on the option, to require employers to return PAYE information at the time they complete an employment- related process (for example, when they take on new staff and when they run the payroll). There are several possible approaches to introducing the option or requirement to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process. These are identified for comment, as follows: • Under a voluntary-first approach, employers could choose to meet their PAYE information requirements by providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the same time the business processes are run (for example, provide information about PAYE deductions when the payroll is run). After an undefined period a review would be conducted, as described below. More accurate and timely PAYE information would allow Inland Revenue to intervene more quickly to stop errors continuing and to improve individuals’ access to social policy entitlements. The Government envisages that if Inland Revenue receives more timely PAYE information, this will reduce existing pressure points around secondary tax by enabling improved administrative interventions. Better PAYE information would also provide a foundation for future improvements to the delivery of social policy. Finally, better PAYE information could improve the value that the Government obtains from sharing information between government agencies (when appropriate). For these reasons, the Government is consulting on a number of proposed changes to the law relating to the provision of PAYE information. PAYE information submitted electronically is quicker and cheaper to process than information submitted on paper. Employers now make much greater use of digital technology than they did in 1999, when the threshold above which employers are required to use electronic means to file their employer monthly schedule was introduced. Feedback is sought on the proposal that the threshold above which employers are required to use electronic means to file their employer monthly schedule is reduced from $100,000 a year of PAYE and employer's superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) to $50,000 a 10 retained, at least for the foreseeable future. As noted above, those who are unable to access the internet or other digital services could be exempt from a requirement to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs. Feedback is also sought on whether PAYE and other deductions withheld from a employees' salary and wages under the PAYE system should be paid to Inland Revenue at the time employees are paid. Currently, employers retain PAYE deductions from their employees’ salary and wages for a period of time before paying them to Inland Revenue. Pay day payment of PAYE could improve compliance, provide third parties (such as recipients of child support and KiwiSaver contributions) with prompter payments and reduce employers’ compliance costs. However, it would involve a trade-off between these benefits and the benefit the delayed PAYE payment currently provides to employers. summarY Of prOpOsals: gst The Government considers that the current GST rules are generally working well and is not proposing to make fundamental changes to how and when to account for or pay GST³. However, there is an opportunity to modernise the processes of how GST-registered persons provide GST information and how they communicate with Inland Revenue: • by simplifying the process of • Under a review approach, there would be a defined period during which employers could choose to meet their obligations by providing PAYE information at the time of the business process. This would be followed by a required review, when the costs, benefits and experience would be revisited. Depending on the outcome, employers could then be given a lead-in period by the end of which they would have to provide PAYE information at the same time the business process occurs. There could be exemptions for those who could not use digital technology to meet the new requirements. • Under a legislated approach, changes to tax law permitting employers to meet their obligations by providing PAYE information on the new basis would identify a lead-in period, at the end of which employers would be required to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process (for example, provide information about PAYE deductions when the payroll is run). As in the review approach, there could be exemptions for those who could not use digital technology to meet the new requirements. The proposals recognise that some employers have simple payrolls and do not use digital payroll systems. These employers would be catered for with a web-based portal and for those below the digital filing threshold, a paper-based filing option would be 11 You can also make submissions through the online consultation, at: payeandgst.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz Alternatively, written submissions can be addressed to: Better administration of PAYE and GST C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 The closing date for submissions is: 12 February 2016.

The Government is also interested in feedback on whether, in the future, certain registered persons should be required to file their GST information electronically. hOw tO make a submissiOn The way in which PAYE and GST are administered depends on the actions of employers and GST-registered persons. This discussion document seeks feedback from those who participate in the administration of these taxes as well as from taxpayers more generally. The Government invites submissions on the ideas raised in this discussion document. Submissions can be made by emailing “policy.webmaster@ird. govt.nz” with “Better administration of PAYE and GST” in the subject line. 12 The Government is committed to making it easier for people to interact with government agencies. For tax administration, this means improved services from the tax system, with minimised costs for customers and government. The Government’s Better digital services discussion document proposed that for this to happen Inland Revenue would need to offer a wider range of secure digital services. It would need to work with others including business software providers, so that core tax functions such as PAYE and GST are built into customers’ regular transactions rather than tax having to be separately managed. A central premise for minimising the costs of administering PAYE and GST and improving the services that can be delivered is the proposed integration of PAYE and GST requirements into the business software that customers increasingly use. This will require a redesign of tax processes around the customer’s normal business activities and would enable the customer to use their business software to also meet their tax obligations. Integrating tax requirements into business processes using software offers customers a number of benefits, including: • greater confidence that they are correctly calculating the tax to pay and/or deductions to be made; • a better customer experience due to less double-handling and improved processes; and • rapid processing of information so the customer can see an up- to-date view of their account and automatically receive return messages from Inland Revenue. The discussion document Better digital services stated as a core requirement that digital tax services would be designed to be secure and reliable. As an overarching principle it was proposed that “services must be designed for the customer” with three subsidiary principles to guide future development. They were: • that no one size fits all; • that tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical; and what YOu tOld us "We agree that making greater use of a business's own systems to provide information should provide benefits to employers..." ⁴ chapTer 2 inTegraTing Tax reQuireMenTs inTo Business processes using sofTware 13 “cloud”, accessed through a browser or from a mobile phone. Better digital services should be sufficiently flexible to run on new platforms as they emerge. In a world of rapidly changing technology, the Government does not want Inland Revenue to divert its focus from its core tax and social policy role by developing and maintaining the range of software applications that would be required. Instead, Inland Revenue would work with software providers so that they can design applications to allow a customer’s software to interact with Inland Revenue. Software providers have already been invited to early discussions with Inland Revenue and will have access to business rules and standards to make the proposed new digital services available to their customers. The Government recognises that some customers have developed or customised their payroll and business systems. The support and information offered to software providers will need to extend to these customers to ensure that they can access the new digital services in a cost-effective manner. A number of those who provided feedback on the Better digital services discussion document suggested that, in addition to working with the private sector to develop software, Inland Revenue must provide a simple “web browser option” through which customers can submit their information. The option of filing through a “web portal” will continue. • change will not be imposed without careful consideration of costs and benefits. Feedback on these principles was generally positive. However, submitters suggested that the following additional principles should also guide Inland Revenue’s development of digital services: • security and privacy; • reliability and accuracy; • flexibility and simplicity; • time and cost effectiveness; and • equity and support for users. Some of the issues raised by submitters, such as reliability and simplicity, will inform detailed design of the services, and others will be considered in the context of planning customer engagement and support. A number of the issues raised in feedback on the earlier Making Tax Simpler documents are considered in the following discussion. wOrking with sOftware prOviders tO integrate requirements with business prOcesses Feedback on the discussion document Better digital services indicated that to meet varied needs and preferences, services would have to be offered in a variety of ways.

Inland Revenue now has the capacity to “publish” its interpretation of PAYE and GST obligations in a way that can be incorporated directly into payroll and accounting software. The current practice is to provide ‘payroll specifications’ to software providers when PAYE related legislation changes. Feedback suggests that the specifications can be ambiguous in complex cases. Incorporating Inland Revenue’s tax rules into software would provide customers and the Government with greater confidence that tax and related deductions have been calculated correctly. It is proposed that software providers would be able to choose whether to directly incorporate Inland Revenue’s rules into their software – it would be a commercial decision for them. It will allow a customer, who does not adopt software that can file directly with Inland Revenue, to enter or attach their data through a secure web-based service. Information security is a critical concern for many of those who made submissions on Better digital services, as it is for Government. Core elements of the proposed future for PAYE and GST information include: • Ensuring that the customer controls how their software passes data to and from Inland Revenue. For example, the customer would authorise what is transferred to Inland Revenue. • Ensuring that the external “parties”, such as customer business software, that access Inland Revenue services are able to interact securely. • Requiring that the customers who can use external “parties” to access Inland Revenue’s systems are themselves authenticated and have their identity verified. • Inland Revenue will continue to have robust systems for ensuring that only authorised staff can access customer data. These systems record who has accessed customer data. PAYE and GST impose obligations on customers to calculate tax owing, file information and pay obligations. The remainder of this chapter outlines how integrating tax requirements into software that customers increasingly what YOu tOld us "The increased use of digital services must not put taxpaper information at greater risk of loss, unauthorised sharing, or improper use." 15 is developed by software providers and the banks. There is scope, however, to make it faster and easier for customers to pay their obligations. The objective is to minimise the required reconciliation between information and payment and eliminate errors that arise as a result of manual processes. Possible changes to the timing of PAYE payments are set out in Chapter 6. suppOrt fOr users Inland Revenue’s proposed approach is to work with third-party providers so that they can design the software that will support the new digital services. Education, promotion and support will therefore be a shared responsibility. The Government recognises, however, that increased outreach, education and communication from Inland Revenue will play a key role in supporting customers to understand and adopt the new digital services. The diagram on page 18 depicts a change from a model where customers interact with Inland Revenue using information that they, or their software, has calculated to a model where, in the normal course of events, customers only interact with their software to meet their tax obligations. Some submissions on the Better digital services discussion document expressed concern that the Government might assume that digital channels could completely replace other means of communicating using sOftware tO mOdernise the waY infOrmatiOn is prOvided The new digital services that Inland Revenue proposes to work with the software industry to develop, include the following (which are subsequently referred to as the “new digital services”): • The ability for customers to submit their PAYE and GST information to Inland Revenue from within their payroll or accounting system. • The ability to receive and upload information from Inland Revenue directly into their payroll or accounting system. The objective is to change the focus from filing a return, to submitting required information to Inland Revenue as a by-product of things the customer would normally be doing. Inland Revenue is working with a small number of software providers to develop and pilot services, which do not require law changes, see Chapter 7. For PAYE, integrating information requirements into software opens up the opportunity to change when PAYE information is provided to Inland Revenue.

This chapter discusses some potential changes that could be made to update the PAYE rules. Before discussing specific areas where changes could be made, it is worth outlining the basic framework of our withholding tax system. prOgressive incOme tax rates and Our withhOlding tax sYstem New Zealand’s income tax system taxes income from labour and capital at progressive rates for individuals. The progressive rates apply to a person’s total annual income from all sources, including income from employment. Where possible, payers of income (employers and banks, for example) are generally required to withhold tax on behalf of the people who earned the income. This applies to income from employment (PAYE) and income from capital (resident withholding tax – RWT). This promotes revenue integrity, is efficient and reduces compliance costs for individual earners. The withholding tax system is designed so that the sum of what is periodically withheld from income earned throughout the year is as close as possible to the person’s actual annual tax liability on that income. Broadly, the approach adopted is to apply the progressive income tax rate structure to a person’s main source of income and a marginal rate to secondary sources of income. Under this system, the reasonable assumption is made that a person’s main source of income is their main source of employment. For example, if Roxy earns an annual salary of $50,000 from her full-time employment as a café manager, she should advise her employer to use the progressive rate tax code (the “M” code). Roxy’s employer would deduct PAYE from her salary using the progressive income tax rate structure. This is achieved in the PAYE tables by using an average tax rate based on applying the progressive tax rate what YOu tOld us "We support the proposal to review and update the PAYE... rules as the original framework of the rules was established in a different era and changes have been made in an ad hoc manner." chapTer 3 Modernising The paYe rules 19 from a secondary source takes a person’s total income over an income tax rate threshold. However, our reasonably narrow progressive tax rate scale means that, for most people, the discrepancies are small. The requirement or ability for individuals to file an end-of-year tax return allows any inaccuracies to be dealt with. Special tax codes can be used when the standard tax codes are not appropriate, to improve withholding accuracy during the year. In future, small under- and over- payments could be dealt with more efficiently in a digital world. Inland Revenue receiving more timely PAYE information during the year should also enable special tax codes to be better used in the future. Further advantages of the current approach to withholding are that it does not require employers and other withholders to have knowledge of a person’s other income sources, or to regularly change tax codes/rates. The Government proposes retaining the current basic framework of our withholding system. secO n darY ta x Secondary tax is an integral part of the PAYE system. Secondary tax aims to ensure that a person earning a given amount of PAYE income from multiple sources pays no more, or no less, tax than a person earning the same amount of PAYE income from a single source. structure to the projected annual income from that employment on a pay period basis. If Roxy also had a term deposit on which she expected to receive $500 of interest during the tax year, she should advise her bank to withhold tax from that interest at her marginal tax rate – in other words, the correct rate for the last dollar of interest income if the $500 interest is treated as the last income earned. In this case, Roxy should elect a 30 percent RWT rate because annual income in the $48,001 to $70,000 income bracket is subject to a 30 percent income tax rate. The approach of taxing at a person’s marginal tax rate also applies to salary or wages earned from a second job. Our approach of using the withholding system to apply the progressive tax scale to a person’s main source of income, and marginal tax rates to secondary sources of income works reasonably well in most situations. Provided the income from employment is earned smoothly throughout the year, the amount withheld under the PAYE and RWT rules will closely approximate the person’s end-of-year income tax liability on that income. The majority of employees have PAYE deducted to within +/-$50 for the year (52 percent for the 2013–14 tax year). Our current withholding system produces some inaccuracies in certain situations, such as when a person’s income from their main income source fluctuates over the course of the tax year, and when income 20 Roxy is a café manager whose annual salary is $50,000.

However, the Government envisages that pressure points around secondary tax will be reduced as the administration of tax is modernised. Modernising the way PAYE information is provided – for example, via businesses’ payroll software submitting PAYE information directly to Inland Revenue’s systems on a pay period basis – is a crucial step in modernising the tax system. This will result in Inland Revenue receiving more timely PAYE information, which will enable it to more quickly identify taxpayers who are potentially having PAYE over-withheld (or under- withheld). If the over-withholding (or under-withholding) is due to the taxpayer being on an incorrect tax code, Inland Revenue could make an intervention to correct this. If the over-withholding is due to an income tax rate threshold being crossed, this could be addressed through better use of special tax codes, enabled by Inland Revenue receiving better PAYE information during the year. For example, if Inland Revenue’s analytics show that an employee is in this situation, Inland Revenue could suggest the use of a special tax code to the employee. Further, under the Government’s idea, set out in the Green Paper, to potentially have income tax squared- up annually for all individuals, people should always receive refunds if they overpaid tax. When tax is calculated on income earned from a person’s main source of employment income or an income- tested benefit, the progressivity of the personal income tax scale is factored in. The tax withheld therefore reflects the person’s average tax rate on that income. If a person has multiple jobs (or is a beneficiary or ACC compensation recipient who is also in employment), tax is withheld from their secondary source(s) of PAYE income based on a flat tax rate that reflects the marginal tax rate that the person expects to apply for that tax year. A common misconception is that secondary tax is unfair because people pay a higher rate of tax on income earned from secondary jobs than their main job. The progressive nature of the personal income tax scale, however, means that this is appropriate. By taxing at the person’s marginal tax rate, secondary tax codes prevent inappropriate multiple claims of the lowest (or lower) tax rates for people with concurrent sources of PAYE income, which would result in tax owing at the end of the tax year. Secondary tax can, however, cause tax to be over-withheld throughout the year if a person’s secondary income takes them over an income tax rate threshold. If this occurs, the person can claim a refund for the over-withheld tax at the end of the tax year. Alternatively, they can apply to Inland Revenue for a special tax code so that, over the course of the year, tax is deducted at a rate tailored to their individual circumstances. what YOu tOld us "The secondary tax system seems to penalise people. A client has a part-time job and has been offered another smaller job. She wanted to know whether it would be worthwhile or not given the secondary tax" questiOns fOr readers 3.1 Do you support the Government’s vision for reducing existing pressure points around secondary tax through improved administrative intervention during the year, as a result of Inland Revenue receiving more timely PAYE information? 3.2 While maintaining our current income tax rate structure, do you have any better suggestions for reducing pressure points around secondary tax by improving the accuracy of withholding tax at source? 22 On the other hand, some believe that the formula is not accurate enough in all situations. For example, the formula does not take into account that previous pays may have also contained an extra pay, which causes an over-estimation of annual earnings, and can result in tax being withheld from the extra pay at too high a rate. Another issue is that the formula is based on the assumption that the employee is being paid according to their normal pay frequency, which may not always be so. An additional pay date or an incomplete pay period, within the four-week period can affect the estimation of annual earnings and, hence, the rate at which tax is withheld from the extra pay. The consequence of a simpler method for determining the amount of tax to be withheld from an extra pay would be less accuracy. A more accurate formula implies more complexity. The question is how we reconcile these conflicting perceptions. The Green Paper set out the Government’s idea of potentially requiring all individuals to undertake an annual square-up of income tax. The process is envisaged to be less onerous than at present as a result of greater pre-population of information in the future. If all taxpayers will have any under- or over-payments of tax squared-up, this suggests that withholding accuracy should become less important, which would point towards simpler tax rules. The taxatiOn Of extra paYs Lump sum payments made in connection with a person’s employment are known as “extra pays”. These are payments that are not regularly included in the employee’s salary or wages for a pay period, and are not for overtime. They include bonuses, gratuities, back-pay, profit shares, redundancy payments and retirement allowances. The Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill, introduced on 30 June 2015, proposes to allow employers, on a voluntary basis, to also treat employee share scheme benefits as an extra pay. The PAYE rules are designed to tax extra pays at the employee’s marginal tax rate. A graduated flat tax rate is applied to an extra pay which is determined by adding the amount of the extra pay to a proxy for annual employment earnings (excluding the extra pay). The proxy used is the annualised value of all PAYE income payments made to the employee in the period starting four weeks before the payment date. The rationale for taxing extra pays at the employee’s marginal tax rate is that taxing them as ordinary salary or wages may result in too much tax being withheld. It would assume that an extra pay represented a permanent increase in salary or wages, rather than an additional one-off payment. The current formula for determining the amount of tax for an extra pay is perceived as complex by some employers. coMplex = More accuraTe siMple = less accur aTe ? ? ? 23 that occur before a mid-year salary or wage rise. The advantage, however, of looking back only four weeks is that, if the extra pay occurs after a mid-year pay increase has occurred, there is a good chance the previous four weeks’ pay will reflect what the employee will earn in each following four-week period in the tax year. There is another tension at play. Employers using payroll software should be able to cope relatively easily with a complex extra pay formula. For employers calculating the tax on extra pays manually, however, a complex formula presents a problem. If all employers were using software, it would seem reasonable for the extra pay formula to focus on accuracy at the expense of simplicity, even in a tax system with a mandatory annual square-up. However, given that some employers will continue to manually calculate PAYE for the foreseeable future, the calculation needs to be relatively simple. If a method that determines the proxy for annual earnings based on the last four weeks’ pay remains the preferred approach, should there be any fine-tuning of the existing formula? One way of improving the accuracy of the formula could be to exclude any previous extra pays made in the four-week period when calculating the proxy for annual earnings, then add all extra pays made in the current tax year (rather than just the latest extra pay) to this proxy for annual earnings. This result would be used to determine the rate of tax on the extra pay. Such an approach would mean that employers would have to keep simplest way to tax an extra pay would be to treat these payments in the same way as ordinary salary or wages. For an employee on an “M” tax code, this would be to apply the PAYE tax tables published by Inland Revenue. However, the consequence of this would be that tax would frequently be over-withheld on extra pays. While this would be squared- up at year-end, this will affect the employee’s cash-flow. The simpler the tax rules are for employers, the greater the adverse impact on employees. A balance is needed. If treating extra pays in the same way as ordinary salary or wages fails to strike the right balance between simplicity and accuracy, consideration could be given to whether there is a proxy for annual employment earnings that is preferable to the proxy used in the existing formula. An alternative proxy could be to divide year-to-date (YTD) employment earnings by the number of weeks (or pay periods) to which they relate and multiply this by 52 (or the number of pay periods in the year – for example, 26 for a fortnightly pay cycle) to get an annualised value. A proxy based on average YTD earnings would be relatively accurate for extra pays that occur late in the tax year, but could be quite inaccurate for extra pays that occur earlier in the tax year. This is because if an employee receives a pay rise during the year, their earnings for the rest of the year would reflect their increased salary or wages, not their average YTD salary or wages. The existing approach can also be relatively inaccurate for extra pays what YOu tOld us "Why not just look at year-to-date earnings?" 24 applying that average amount to the gross earnings in the current pay period. If an employer is paying a commission, bonus or similar payment for a defined period of less than 12 months, they can choose to calculate withholding tax by using the number of pay periods the payment relates to rather than the number of pay periods in the financial year. New Zealand’s existing method is simpler for employers than Australia’s simple method. It involves fewer steps and does not introduce additional complexity by offering employers choices depending on the period the payment relates to. The Government is interested in feedback on the idea of introducing two calculation method options in New Zealand and, if this is preferred, what the calculation method options should be. track of all extra pays made during the year. This should not be a problem for employers using payroll software, but could be an additional compliance cost for employers doing their payroll manually. Again, it comes back to a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. Another option would be to give employers two options for calculating the tax on extra pays – a relatively complex, but more accurate, method suited to employers with payroll software and a relatively simple, but less accurate, method suited to employers without payroll software. This is the approach that has been taken in Australia. Australia’s complex method is considerably more complicated than New Zealand’s current method. For back payments relating to specific periods in the current financial year, withholding is recalculated for each pay period to which the back payment relates. For back payments relating to an earlier financial year, or any additional payments (including commissions, bonuses or similar payments) that do not relate to a single pay period, withholding is calculated by averaging all additional payments made in the current financial year over the number of pay periods in a financial year, and applying that to the average total earnings to date. Australia’s simple method calculates withholding by apportioning additional payments made in the current pay period over the number of pay periods in a financial year, and questiOns fOr readers 3.3 What do you think is more important – making the method for calculating tax on extra pays simpler for employers, or making the method for calculating tax on extra pays more accurate, to reduce instances of too much tax being withheld for employees? 3.4 How do you think the amount of tax to be deducted from an extra pay should be determined? Do you think the current method is acceptable, or can you suggest a better alternative? 3.5 What do you think about the idea of introducing two options – a simple method or a complex, but more accurate, method – that an employer could use to determine the amount of tax to be withheld from an extra pay?

One way would be by providing legislative clarification, perhaps by amending the lists of the kinds of payments included in the definitions of “salary or wages” and “extra pay” in the Income Tax Act 2007. Alternatively, Inland Revenue could clarify the treatment (under existing legislation) administratively via some form of publication. extra paY daY in a tax Year In a tax year an extra pay day sometimes occurs.

The policy intent is that the tax treatment depends on whether the holiday pay is a lump sum payment (in which case it should be treated as an extra pay) or is included in an employee’s regular pay or paid in substitution for an employee’s ordinary salary or wages when annual paid holidays are taken (in which case it should be treated as salary or wages).

Employers are encouraged to inform their employees if they will receive an additional pay during a tax year, and that this will likely mean they will have tax under-withheld. They are also encouraged to put processes in place so their employees can request additional amounts to be withheld. The Government is interested in your feedback on whether New Zealand should introduce a mechanism for withholding additional amounts in years when an extra pay date will occur. If your answer is “yes”, feedback is sought on whether it should be: • Mandatory for all employers who know they will have an extra pay day in a tax year to withhold additional amounts from affected employees. • Optional for employers who know they will have an extra pay day in a tax year to withhold additional amounts from affected employees. If this is your preferred option, feedback is also sought on whether it should be compulsory or optional for those employers who chose not to implement additional withholding for all their affected employees to withhold additional amounts from employees who have specifically requested this. • Only required by employers for employees who have specifically requested their employer to withhold additional amounts. person’s annual tax liability on their total annual income. This occurs because the amounts to be withheld under the Commissioner’s PAYE tables are based on the standard number of pay days occurring in the tax year (for example, 26 pay days for a fortnightly pay period). If an individual is a filing taxpayer, there will be a square-up and, all other things being equal, they will have tax to pay for the year. These tax bills are often unexpected and can result in employees blaming their employer, in the mistaken belief that tax has been withheld from their pay incorrectly. This problem could be amplified in the future, if all individuals are required to undertake an annual income tax square-up. This is because currently, the income tax liability for a year of a non-filing taxpayer is the total tax withheld throughout the tax year, so there is no square-up if they have received an additional payment in a tax year. The problem currently occurs because the Commissioner’s PAYE tables and payroll software assume the usual number of pay days will occur in a tax year. One way to address this could be for the Commissioner to also publish PAYE tables that are based on an extra pay day occurring in a tax year, and programming payroll software to detect if an extra pay day will occur in a tax year, and adjusting calculation of the amount to be withheld from payments of salary or wages accordingly. The Australian approach to this problem is to allow an employee 27 • For a pay period of one month or less, the amount of tax for the full payment for the pay period is based on the new tax rates. • For a pay period of more than one month, the amount of tax is determined by apportioning the payment between the old and new tax rates. When salary or wages are paid after a date on which a rate change comes into force and the payment relates to a pay period ending before the change, tax should be deducted based on the previous rates. The tax rate to be applied to an extra pay is the relevant rate in force at the time the payment is made. The ACC earners’ levy payable on behalf of an employee is based on a rate set in regulations, which applies to liable earnings for pay periods ending in the applicable tax year. Student loan deductions When the student loan repayment rate or annual repayment threshold are changed during a pay period, the same rules that apply for PAYE deduction purposes apply for student loan deduction purposes. KiwiSaver contributions and ESCT For KiwiSaver, when the minimum employee contribution and compulsory employer contribution rates for a payment of gross salary or wages have been changed, the approach that has been taken is • Optional for employers whose employees have specifically requested their employer to withhold additional amounts Another option would be to preserve the status quo for the next few years and deal with the problem in the future, if and when a requirement is introduced for all individuals to undertake an annual income tax square-up. This could mean giving the individual the option to either pay the tax owed, or have withholding rates adjusted until the under- withheld tax has been recovered. paY periOds vs paY dates – what tO dO when there is a leg is l at e d r at e chan g e Current state Currently, different tax types/products have different rules on what is to be done when there is a change to a legislated rate during a pay period. The rates that apply for some PAYE-related tax types/products are based on the pay date, others on the pay period end-date or pay period start-date, while apportionment of a payment between the old and new rates sometimes applies. This has been raised as a source of complexity and confusion, which adds to compliance costs PAYE income payments When the tax rates for salary or wages are changed during a pay period, the amount of tax is determined as follows: questiOns fOr readers 3.8 Do you think a mechanism should be introduced for withholding additional amounts of tax from employees’ salary or wages in years when an extra pay day will occur? 3.9 If you think that a mechanism should be introduced, which of the options outlined would you prefer? 28 October 20X1, and it remains at this rate for the remaining six months of the tax year. Because a tax rate cut occurred half way through the tax year, a composite income tax rate of 25 percent would apply for the tax year. Assume an employee was paid for a six-week pay period that ended on 7 October 20X1. If tax was withheld entirely at the new rate of 20 percent, then assuming the employee earned income smoothly over the entire year, the employee would have had tax under-withheld for the year. Assuming that the employee was a filing taxpayer, they would have tax to pay. Apportionment provides a solution to this problem. However, because apportionment is more complicated, the existing rules strike a balance with simplicity by only requiring apportionment for pay periods longer than one month, where withholding inaccuracies would be more significant. For pay periods shorter than one month, tax is simply deducted from the full payment at the new rate. A pay date approach would, however, improve withholding accuracy when a tax rate change comes into force at the start of a new tax year. A tax year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Employment income is derived by an employee (other than a shareholder- employee) when it is received. For example, if a payment of salary or wages is made to an employee on 5 April 20X2 for a pay period that ran from 18 to 31 March 20X2, the payment is treated as derived during the tax year running from 1 April 20X2 to 31 March 20X3. To maximise accuracy, it would be preferable to that the new rates apply from the first pay period starting on or after 1 April. The ESCT rate to be applied to the employer’s superannuation cash contribution is the relevant rate in force at the time the payment is made. Options for change To simplify the process for employers, the Government is exploring the possibility of aligning the rules about what to do when there is a legislated rate change during a pay period across the different tax types/ products. The rules could be aligned based on either: • the pay date; • the pay period end-date; • the pay period start-date; or • apportionment. Not all payments relate to a specific pay period (for example, extra pays). This points towards a pay date-based approach, if alignment is seen as a preferred option. A pay date-based approach would be simpler for employers, but the trade- off would be reduced withholding accuracy in some circumstances. The current rules promote better withholding accuracy than a pay date approach when tax rate changes occur during a tax year. For example, assume that there was a flat income tax rate of 30 percent from 1 April 20X1 to 30 September 20X1 and then it is cut to 20 percent from 1 29 base the amount of tax to be withheld from the payment of salary or wages on the tax rates in force on the pay date. questiOns fOr readers 3.10 Do you think that legislated rate changes should be applied in the same way across PAYE-related tax types/products? 3 .11 Do you think that a pay date approach is the best option for alignment? 30 PAYE is a withholding tax mechanism where New Zealand employers (and PAYE intermediaries) deduct income tax and the ACC earners’ levy from salaries and wages and pay it directly to Inland Revenue. Employers range from large multi- nationals to small businesses and individuals, and also include trusts, not-for-profit organisations, central and local government, partnerships and sole traders. Government agencies including the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), ACC and Inland Revenue are also subject to PAYE obligations where they pay taxable benefits.⁵ For the purposes of this discussion document, they are all referred to as “employers”, as are payroll intermediaries who assume PAYE obligations on behalf on employers. The PAYE process is also used to collect other payments and information, including the repayment of student loans, KiwiSaver contributions and some child support obligations.⁶ PAYE income information is used in the calculation of an employee’s eligibility for Working for Families tax credits, in determining child support obligations and in determining whether the correct benefit entitlement from MSD has been received. The PAYE process is also used by employers to deduct and report PAYE withheld from income that falls within the “schedular payment rules”⁷. Changes to the scope of these rules are being considered and may be included in a subsequent Making Tax Simpler discussion document. In response to consultation on the Green Paper and Better digital services documents, some employers described themselves as “unpaid tax collectors for government” and said they would like to be either compensated or have their compliance burden materially reduced. Minimising compliance costs is an important objective in reforming the tax administration system, but so are improving the services to the various customer groups shown in the following diagram and reducing administration costs. chapTer 4 paYe – Modernising how inforMaTion is provided 31 Employers with over $100,000 a year of PAYE (including ESCT) must provide their employer monthly schedule and their employers’ deductions form, in an electronic format.⁹ Employers can file their employer monthly schedule in a range of ways: • ‘Electronic file transfer’, which is accessed through Inland Revenue’s secure web based portal (myIR).

The current PAYE information process creates problems for employers and employees and limits Government’s use of the information. Problems for employers Inland Revenue conducts a periodic survey of tax-related compliance costs among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The most recent survey was conducted in 2013. It indicated that the median value for SMEs with PAYE obligations was 12 hours a year on PAYE and a further 9 hours on KiwiSaver or a total of 21 hours a year. The median SME compliance cost was valued at $550 a year for PAYE and $188 a year for KiwiSaver, a combined value of $738 a year. monthly schedule form accessed through myIR and using ir-File to electronically send it to Inland Revenue.

It is, however, constrained by the largely paper world for which 32 . 3% (61, 631) FILE TRANSFER 32% (60,583) ONSCREEN FORM 35.3% (67,677) PAPER 64.3% elecTronic reTurns paYe returns: main filing methOd¹⁰ 33 Problems for employees It is not just the interface with employers that requires improvement. Accurate PAYE information is critical to the proper operation of income- related social policies. The fact that PAYE information is aggregated into a monthly return is a key limitation in the current system as it is not possible for government agencies that use the information to accurately calculate weekly or fortnightly income. Inland Revenue’s ability to effectively use PAYE information is further constrained because PAYE information is not received until the following month. For example, as outlined in Chapter 3, under the secondary tax system, employees whose secondary income takes them over an income tax rate threshold are at risk of having tax over-withheld. If Inland Revenue had more timely information, it could intervene more quickly, perhaps to suggest a special tax code to the employee. As illustrated in the following examples, problems with the timeliness and accuracy of PAYE information limit the extent to which social policy recipients can be confident of receiving their correct social policy entitlements during the year and avoiding social policy debt. The problems illustrated in these examples take time and effort to resolve, and because employees usually go to their employer when something is ‘wrong’ with their pay, they can impose costs on employers as well as employees. The following comments are representative of those made in focus groups, pre-consultation discussions and in feedback on the Green Paper and the Better digital services discussion document: • Employers would like to be advised of the correct deductions from day one. • There are too many forms. • The IR344 (employee monthly schedule amendment form) is cumbersome and time-consuming – not set up for multiple entries. • Mail is a poor channel to stop and start deductions; things get delayed. • Why doesn’t Inland Revenue send bulk data (for example, child support or tax code changes) in a form that can be automatically uploaded? • The Inland Revenue website is not optimised for relevance; it is hard to find information. • The examples Inland Revenue provides are simplistic and do not provide guidance in complex cases. • All information from Inland Revenue (regardless of how it is delivered) should be clearer and easier to understand. • We have difficulty in reconciling with Inland Revenue records. • Why does it take Inland Revenue so long to process the employer monthly schedule and to action amendments? questiOns fOr readers Feedback from employers has identified the following concerns with the current PAYE information process: • difficulties in setting up new staff; • problems changing deductions; • difficulty in making changes to information already filed; • problems with understanding and reconciling the information Inland Revenue makes available to employers; and • concerns about the time it takes Inland Revenue to process employer monthly schedules and action amendments. 4 .1 Are these the key areas of concern with the PAYE information process from an employer’s perspective? 4.2 Are there other aspects of the process of providing PAYE information that are significant sources of frustration/wasted time that should be rectified? questiOn fOr readers 4.3 Do current PAYE processes cause other problems for employees that should be addressed? what YOu tOld us "social policy should be de-linked from the annual tax cycle." 34 • helping employers and employees to understand the information held about them. Opportunities to improve the use of PAYE information across government include: • ensuring ACC has the information it needs to accurately calculate the ACC Workplace Cover (employers) levy; • making better use of income information to ensure individuals receive their social policy entitlements; • redesign of social policy to better match income assistance to the recipient’s needs; and • detecting fraud, including through more timely matching of data with MSD.¹¹ prOviding paYe infOrmatiOn at the same time as the emplOYer’s business prOcess The idea that PAYE obligations could be integrated into normal business processes (for example, adding, paying and removing staff from the payroll), and information sent to Inland Revenue directly from payroll software, was included in Chapter 2 of the Green Paper. The concept received general support although submitters noted the likely cost for employers of upgrading their systems and the need to cater for those who do not use payroll systems. Chapter 2 identified at a high level Better PAYE income information would also create opportunities to improve the future administration of social policy, for example by reducing the annual period over which many social policies are currently assessed. Entitlement to Working for Families tax credits is, for example, currently assessed and “squared up” on an annual basis. A shorter period of assessment could allow assistance to more effectively match periods of need. Problems for Government There are also opportunities to reduce the administrative costs of processing PAYE returns and make better use of PAYE information including, where appropriate, sharing it with other government agencies. The estimated administrative cost for the Government to collect $100 of PAYE in 2013-14 was $0.25. While this is lower than the cost across all tax types where the average is $0.86, there is scope for further reduction. If PAYE information showed the detail of what was paid on a pay day basis, was submitted digitally, and was accurately calculated, the following administrative costs could be reduced: • processing paper returns; • contacting employers and employees to correct inaccurate information; • using PAYE information to support the effective operation of social policies such as Working for Families and Student Loans; and example 1 Income is a key determinant of eligibility for Working for Families tax credits, and despite contact from Inland Revenue to identify the possibility of over- or under-payment, more than 52,000 families who received Working for Families tax credits in the year to 30 June 2014 were under- or over-paid during the year, by more than $500. Effective redevelopment of the systems that support Working for Families customers requires accurate, timely income information. example 2 Employees with student loan obligations, who earn above a minimum income threshold, repay their loans through the PAYE system. If borrowers fall behind in their repayments they can be required to make additional repayments which are imposed through additional deduction notices. These notices generally have the effect of increasing the student loan repayment rate from 12 percent of salary to 17 percent. In the year ended June 2015 more than 18,700 borrowers could have avoided additional deductions if they had been on the correct tax code. Because PAYE information, including the tax code for new employees, is provided after employees are first paid it is not possible under the current system for Inland Revenue to pre-empt the use of incorrect tax codes by student loan borrowers. The diagram on the next page illustrates what would be possible if tax codes were checked before employees were first paid. 35 minimising additiOnal student lOan repaYments New employee provides their details to their employer.

Following registration they are provided with information about their PAYE and related obligations, and Inland Revenue sets up their details. Proposed change In future it is proposed that payroll packages and services would include an option to notify Inland Revenue of the decision to become an employer. Existing options such as registering as an employer at the time a company is registered with the Companies Office would remain. Similarly, it is proposed that payroll software could be used to advise Inland Revenue of a decision to permanently, or temporarily, cease to employ staff. This would eliminate the risk of an ex-employer being wrongly pursued for failure to file PAYE information, and would eliminate the need to file nil returns when someone has temporarily ceased to be an employer. The current requirement to register as an employer is an operational matter. It is not a legal requirement and there is no current requirement to advise Inland Revenue of a decision to cease to employ staff. how PAYE obligations could be integrated into payroll software to make providing PAYE information largely a by-product of the processes the employer would be using to employ and pay their staff. The remainder of this chapter looks at PAYE processes in more detail. It seeks feedback on whether the proposed use of payroll software to provide information at the time of the payroll process would reduce compliance costs. Options for employers without payroll software that supports the “new digital services” (essentially the ability to send information directly from payroll software to Inland Revenue and to receive information back), are outlined in the section on providing information through a web portal and, for those without digital access, in Chapter 5. The diagrams on the next page summarise the differences between the current process and the proposed new processes. As part of modernising the tax administration, Inland Revenue is thinking more widely about taxpayer needs and behaviours, and building an environment that supports taxpayers right from the start. Processes which make it easy for an employer to get an employee on the right deductions from the beginning of their employment and easy for both the employer and Inland Revenue to update information are consistent with this new direction. questiOns fOr readers 4.4 Do you support the proposal that employers should notify Inland Revenue of a decision to commence, temporarily cease or permanently cease to be an employer? 4.5 Should these requirements be included in legislation? 37 integratiOn Of paYe infOrmatiOn requirements with business prOcesses Current Processes Possible Future Processes PAYE information is submitted in the month after the business process has been completed. Inland Revenue communicates back to employers by paper, phone and email, usually several pay days after the event. PAYE information could be communicated to Inland Revenue from the payroll software at the time the employer completes the business process (for example takes on a new employee or, runs the payroll). Much of the return communication from Inland Revenue could be sent automatically, arriving much more quickly, eliminating some errors, limiting others and providing more timely information.

Once the new digital services are fully operational,¹² the response could: • Advise whether the IRD number is correct. If Inland Revenue could not positively verify the employee’s identity, messages would be generated to both the employer and employee asking the employee to make contact to verify the IRD number. • Once the employee’s identity is confirmed Inland Revenue would: • identify if the proposed tax code is incorrect, for example it may be that a new employee should be using a student loan tax code; • advise the employer of the employee’s KiwiSaver status, and if a contributing member, indicate the appropriate deduction rate; and • advise of any child support deductions or deductions required because of tax arrears. Providing the information at the same time as the employee information is added to the payroll system should ensure the employee is set up correctly from the start. This would reduce the likelihood for under- or over-deductions from the employee and reduce the need for subsequent contact between Inland Revenue and the employer. emplOYing staff, maintaining their details and ceasing tO emplOY staff Currently an employer must include information about a new employee on the employer monthly schedule in the month following when the employee was first paid. The employer has a further obligation to provide employee details, on a KS1¹¹, to Inland Revenue about a new employee who is eligible to join KiwiSaver. Proposed change It is proposed that instead of information about new employees being due in the month after the employee is first paid, the following information could be provided to Inland Revenue directly via the payroll system, when the new employee’s details are added to that system: • employee’s name; • IRD number; • tax code; • contact details (physical address, phone number and email); • start date; and • date of birth – this would be a new requirement and would be used to verify identity and ensure that deductions and contributions are correctly assigned. Inland Revenue could then use information in its system to automatically respond to the employer before the employee sefa - wOrker fOr a medium sized emplOYer Sefa is a payroll officer for a construction firm. Turnover is relatively high amongst their labourers. When they first start, Sefa spends a lot of time sorting out their tax codes and deductions. Some have left before Sefa sorts out their details. Inland Revenue keeps sending information to him about them after they have left. What if Sefa could use the payroll software to send the details of new employees to Inland Revenue and get an automatic response advising of their KiwiSaver status and any required deductions, before the business starts to pay them? This ensures he gets the new employee set up right from the start. He could also use the payroll system to send a message to Inland Revenue when he takes an employee who has left, off the payroll. This would stop Inland Revenue sending him further information about that ex-employee. 39 It should also allow for: • the elimination of the KiwiSaver enrolment forms;¹³ and • deductions for recovering overdue tax to be integrated with the PAYE process. While it is intended that Inland Revenue’s system should automatically respond to the employer, it is not intended that failure to resolve an identity issue would prevent the employer paying the employee on the basis of the information supplied by the employee. Even if it took until the second or third pay cycle to correctly identify an employee it would be an improvement on the current situation. The payroll system could also be used to advise Inland Revenue of relevant updates to an employee’s details. This might include changes to their contact details, or close-off details when they leave the employer. Advising Inland Revenue of the end of the employment relationship would immediately de-link the employer and employee in Inland Revenue’s records, and would prevent further communication about that employee being sent to the employer. More timely advice about employees who cease employment would also improve Inland Revenue’s ability to correctly advise a subsequent employer whether the employee’s proposed tax code is correct. Advice to Inland Revenue at the time an employee is removed from the payroll should represent an improvement over the current situation where the information is included in an employer monthly schedule the following month. It is understood however that employer practice around ceasing casual employees and the rapidity with which employees are removed from the payroll system can vary and the proposal may therefore not be 100 percent effective.¹⁴ Current practice is for Inland Revenue to communicate with both the employer and the employee when an employee’s obligations change. It is proposed that when employee obligations are communicated to an employer or employee details are updated to Inland Revenue by the employer this information would also be communicated to the employee by Inland Revenue. This would provide the employee with the opportunity to correct any information they consider to be wrong. Date of birth Security and privacy were raised as concerns by those who responded to the Government’s Green Paper. To help confirm an individual’s identity and provide greater assurance it is proposed that information provided to Inland Revenue when a new employee is added to the payroll should include their date of birth. Some people use multiple spellings or versions of their name. It is not uncommon for two or more people to have the same name and people can incorrectly transcribe or otherwise wrongly cite an IRD number. Providing an employee’s date of birth questiOns fOr readers 4.6 Do you agree with the proposal that employers should be able to use their payroll software to provide relevant employee details to Inland Revenue at the time those details are entered, changed, or removed from the payroll system? 4.7 Would using payroll software to provide Inland Revenue with details of new employees before they are first paid and being notified of deductions as set out above, reduce or increase compliance costs? If you can quantify the effect please do so. 4.8 Do you support the proposal that Inland Revenue should continue to communicate any change of employee obligations or details to the employee? 40 information to Inland Revenue the following month, using the paper IR348 form or an electronic format acceptable to the Commissioner.¹⁶ Many employers operate electronic payroll systems which build the required information up over the month and the employer then transfers the PAYE information to Inland Revenue using an electronic file transfer. Other employers combine the output from their payroll system, spread sheets or wages book, and enter the monthly figures on the paper IR348 form or log onto myIR and then type the information into an onscreen form in ir-File and send it electronically to Inland Revenue. Whenever information is manually calculated and/or transcribed onto paper or into the onscreen form, there is potential for error. Proposed change It is proposed that PAYE information should be able to be provided to Inland Revenue directly from payroll software at the time the payroll runs. This would eliminate the need to file an employer monthly schedule. Compared with manually calculating and aggregating PAYE information and typing it into an onscreen form or completing a paper form, using payroll software which communicates with Inland Revenue, would save the employer time and effort. It should also reduce, if not eliminate, the calculation and transcription errors which often require the employer to would significantly increase Inland Revenue’s confidence in confirming a person’s IRD number and hence their identity. It should reduce, if not eliminate, confusion over obligations (for example, for child support) or deductions (for example, on whose behalf KiwiSaver contributions or student loan repayments have been made). An employee’s date of birth is also critical to determining eligibility for KiwiSaver. Without it Inland Revenue would be unable to confirm a new employee’s eligibility for KiwiSaver auto enrolment.¹⁵ Employers are not permitted to discriminate on the basis of age, but once an employee has been appointed, they are allowed to collect and record date-of-birth information. It is recognised that some employers currently collect date-of-birth information and others do not. Under the new system it is proposed that employees would still be required to advise their employer of their tax code and this legal obligation could be extended to include providing a date of birth. paYing staff Employers pay staff on different periods, some pay daily, some weekly, others fortnightly, or monthly. Some large employers run multiple payrolls paying different classes of employees on different cycles. All employers are required to aggregate information about the PAYE and related deductions they have withheld during the month, and provide that michael - new emplOYee Michael started his first job in April. His father's name is also Michael and when the young Michael gives the payroll officer his IRD number he provided his father's number by mistake - it was the first one he found in the desk drawer where the family papers were stored. At year end his father requested a personal tax summary because he thought he was probably due a refund for the short period he had had between jobs. He was amazed to find that his income was reported as $31,000 higher than he thought and that he had significant tax to pay. This happened because the son's income was attributed to the father's IRD number. Although the problem got sorted out relatively quickly once he contacted Inland Revenue it caused considerable stress in the interim. If Michael had had to provide his date of birth along with his IRD number the problem could have been avoided. questiOns fOr readers 4.9 Do you agree with the proposal that employers should obtain date- of- birth information and provide this information about their new employees to Inland Revenue? 4 .10 Should the requirement on the employee to provide date-of- birth information be included in legislation? 41 before the information is sent to Inland Revenue the following month. Some readers responded to the proposals in the Green Paper noting that if information was supplied to Inland Revenue more quickly there would be more errors, and there would need to be a simple process for correcting them. Using payroll software can reduce the need for some types of amendments but others will remain, for a number of reasons. These include receipt of information after the payroll has closed, manual input errors by payroll staff, failure to cease payments and reconsideration of the tax treatment applied to payments (for example the taxation of allowances). Unless the amendment to PAYE information is straightforward and can be reflected in the next return or done over the phone, employers who amend their information currently do so using an IR344 form. A separate form must be filled out for each month, which requires amendment, and employers are required to advise Inland Revenue of what was paid in each period and what should have been paid. This process is cumbersome. Payroll intermediaries have the ability to amend PAYE information electronically on an “electronic amendment schedule” and it is proposed that this facility should be improved and made available to employers using payroll software. Once a need for amendment has been discovered, an employer using payroll software uses the system to calculate the PAYE and any other deductions subsequently spend time reconciling the PAYE information on the employer monthly schedule (IR348) with the information that accompanies payment on the IR345. For employers already using payroll software and “file transfer” to submit their employer monthly schedule information, digital submission of data from a payroll system at the time the business process occurs would eliminate the steps of saving the file of PAYE information, logging into ir-File through myIR and sending the employer monthly schedule to Inland Revenue. It is intended that payroll software would present the employer with the PAYE information following the point in each process when the information is finalised – for example, when the payroll has been finalised. There would be a “submit information to Inland Revenue” step in the process. Similarly, some inward messages from Inland Revenue for example, updating child support deductions, could present the information to the employer, and on acceptance, would automatically update the relevant fields without further intervention by the employer. amending paYe infOrmatiOn It is important that the process for making amendments to payroll information is as simple as possible.

Two years ago the business invested in a basic payroll package, but Erin still finds filing PAYE information a pain. Before the 20th of the following month, on a completely different cycle from her payroll, she files the previous month's PAYE information from her payroll system, goes into myIR and uses ir-File to attach the information and then send it to Inland Revenue. What if Erin's payroll package alerted her with a message when the payroll was finalised "submit details to Inland Revenue?" and presented her with the information that was to be submitted? Erin could meet her PAYE information obligations there and then. 42 to the employer’s own record. Consideration has been given to whether Inland Revenue should require the details of the correction in every previous pay period in which the error occurred, or simply the changes that should be made to the employee’s year-to-date record. Correcting previous pay periods would ensure that Inland Revenue has an accurate record of the basis for the PAYE and other deductions that have been made. Information about the period over which the error has been occurring also provides the basis for the calculation of late payment penalties should they be appropriate. The requirement to aggregate the pay day information and fill out a form, for each month in which the error occurred, is however known to impose compliance costs, which some employers have told us are significant. The proposal is that payroll software would both calculate and transmit the amending information reducing compliance costs although employers would still need to either select or insert a reason for the change. Feedback is sought on two options for what information is required: • For each pay period requiring amendment, payroll software could be used to advise Inland Revenue what was paid and deducted and to separately identify what should have been paid and deducted. This would automate the current process and provide the information on a pay under- or over-paid. • Under-payments of gross income are usually corrected in a subsequent payment and Inland Revenue receives PAYE information after that payment is made. No IR344 is required in these circumstances. • Over-payments of income are more complicated. An employer needs the employee’s consent to any repayment, which is usually either repaid in a lump sum or deducted from the person’s subsequent net salary. Inland Revenue treats the overpaid PAYE and other deductions as “made in error” and once notified, refunds or credits them to the employer. • Employers use a variety of means to advise Inland Revenue when the tax treatment is incorrect and there has been an under-payment of PAYE or employer deductions, such as when a taxable allowance is initially treated as non-taxable. Some employers simply use the IR344 form, providing information for each month in which the error occurred, with a reason. Others send an Excel spread sheet with IR344 equivalent information and others will send a letter including the IR 344 information.

Her staff spend a significant amount of time processing amendments to PAYE information. The payroll software is good at working the changes out, but because amending information has to be provided on a monthly basis to match the employer monthly schedule, the information has to be manually aggregated and entered onto amendment forms and sent to Inland Revenue. Under the proposals Awhina's staff could send details of amendments, for the weekly records that needed changed, to Inland Revenue direct from the payroll software, without the need for aggregation or form filling. Because the amending information automatically adjusts the balance due in the PAYE payment the reconciliation process is also simplified. 43 Tax Administration Act 1994 which provides for the correction of minor errors in subsequent periods. The Government is interested in feedback on whether section 113A needs to be extended to cover minor alterations to the tax position employers take when they return PAYE information. Many other changes that are currently notified to Inland Revenue as amendments, such as a change of employee name, could come through the proposed process for changes to employee details. submitting infOrmatiOn thrOugh a web-based pOrtal Inland Revenue currently operates myIR, a web-based portal for accessing information and filing, including filing the employer monthly schedule. It is planned that this portal will be modernised to offer more reliable, secure and user friendly services. Employers not using payroll software supporting the planned new digital services, but who have digital access, could use the portal to submit PAYE information. This could include: • a decision to begin to employ; • details of new employees and people who have ceased employment; • pay day information about PAYE and other deductions; • amendments to PAYE information; and day basis. • Alternatively, payroll software could simply advise of the change required to income and deductions for each pay period in which the error occurred. The Government understands that the majority of amendments to PAYE information and payments arise because of changes to the payroll, not because of changes to the tax treatment. In other words, the income reported has had PAYE deductions correctly calculated but the income amount paid was wrong, and needs to be corrected, with a consequent adjustment to PAYE and other deductions. Where income and deductions have been underpaid this is usually corrected in a subsequent pay and it is at that time that the obligations to notify and pay Inland Revenue would arise. These amendments do not currently, and would not in future, give rise to any liability for late filing or late payment. Where income is overpaid PAYE and other deductions are refunded or credited by Inland Revenue. There are situations, however, where an employer needs to change their tax position and it is not intended that submission from the payroll system would be the only way in which they could do this. The employer will be able to choose how this is communicated.

This includes: • creating more value from New Zealand’s “data assets” by making better use of the information held by government agencies; and • reducing duplication by sharing information between government agencies so businesses and individuals only have to tell government once. At present information is only provided to other agencies where there is specific legal authority or an “approved information sharing agreement” (AISA) authorised by an Order in Council. The discussion document Making Tax Simpler: towards a new Tax Administration Act explores matters of tax secrecy and cross government information sharing. As set out in that discussion document, any move to share information on a different basis, for example with customer’s consent, will require a change to the underlying law. Under current law PAYE information is already used by a number of other • a decision to permanently or temporarily cease employing staff. Submission of PAYE information through the portal would be a separate process, and while the portal would allow an employer to receive information back from Inland Revenue, it would not offer the speed of response of the software-enabled services.

The employer will be able to view their on-line account via payroll software that supports this new service, or via the web portal. It is possible that employers would be able to tailor and filter the presentation of their information to suit their needs. Information received via the new digital services from employers would be processed and updated much more rapidly than at present. The objective would be for customer accounts to be updated on a daily basis and for updated information to then be visible to the employer. The combination of faster processing and more user-friendly display of information should enable some queries that currently prompt phone calls to be resolved on a “self-service” basis. questiOn fOr readers 4 .15 Would the following attributes of the proposed new PAYE processes be of value?

If PAYE information were available on a more timely basis, and identified the pay periods in which payments were received, it would improve MSD’s ability to ensure customers receive the correct benefit entitlements. Currently people are both under- and over-paid benefits during the year.

More accurate and timely income information would enable Inland Revenue to more quickly intervene if an employee’s circumstances change and a change of tax code, or special tax code is appropriate. It is also an essential pre-requisite to any reduction in the annual period over which most social policies are currently delivered.

These benefits also experienced here 47 This Government is not, at this stage, proposing a timeframe for changes to PAYE processes. Inland Revenue has recently begun work to determine the recommended approach to sequencing change across the tax administration system. Until Government has considered the recommended approach and made decisions it is not possible to outline a timetable. The Government expects, however, to have made sufficient progress with planning to introduce legislation in 2016. a staged apprOach This chapter consults on how the law relating to the provision of PAYE information might be changed. The current legislation must be amended before an employer can meet PAYE obligations by submitting information at the same time the business process occurs. Because customers’ needs will vary, it is clear that the development and adoption of software to support the services outlined in the previous chapter, would follow a staged approach. It is likely that services which will allow for direct submission of existing PAY E returns from an employer’s payroll system (for example the employer monthly schedule and KiwiSaver enrolment forms) will be available in the market from late 2016. These services will not allow for submission of PAYE information at the time the business process occurs, or allow for Inland Revenue to automatically communicate back, as outlined in the previous chapter. Developing and releasing services progressively will, however, provide a valuable opportunity to pilot and refine the services. It is anticipated that software providers targeting the small and medium enterprise (SME) market would be the first to release the new digital services and a subset of small and medium employers are expected to dominate the early uptake. Large employers often have customised systems and need to allow adequate time to plan and implement change. implementing the new paYe services The fundamental approach to chapTer 5 paYe inforMaTion – iMpleMenTing change 48 suggested that it should eventually be compulsory. A significant number of submissions were, however, opposed to the idea that digital services might be made compulsory for all employers, with many submissions stating that paper filing should remain, not just to assist those who cannot adopt digital services, but because paper filing might be preferred. As a result of this feedback, the Government is consulting on implementation options that focus on two issues, which are covered in more detail below: • whether it is appropriate to revisit the current thresholds for electronic filing that were established in 1999; and • whether employers should be required to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs. Focusing on when information is provided rather than on how that information is provided leaves the decision about whether or not to use payroll software up to the employer. threshOlds fOr electrOnic filing PAYE information submitted electronically is quicker and cheaper to process than information submitted on paper. The current requirement, that employers with more than $100,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT deductions must file their returns electronically unless they have an implementing change is to build effective customer focussed systems that customers wish to use. Inland Revenue will also use strategies to encourage new customers to use digital services to meet their PAYE information obligations. Because timely, accurate PAYE information is a pre-requisite for future changes to social policy delivery and is also important to the correct delivery of current social policies, the Government has considered whether it should require employers who can access digital services to use payroll software that supports the new digital services outlined in the previous chapter. The central question for the Government in considering proposals to modernise PAYE information is “do the system-wide benefits justify the costs of change?” In assessing the costs and benefits the Government will consider the transition costs as well as on-going costs and take care that the change is not just shifting costs from the Government to employers. Feedback from this discussion document will inform this process. Feedback on the earlier proposal in the Better digital services discussion document, that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could use her powers to require employers who could use digital services but choose not to, and who thereby impose costs on others (in this case employees), was mixed. Some submitters proposed that using digital services could be required where it is feasible, and others what YOu tOld us "Yes certain taxpayers (e.g. employers) should be required to use digital services but only where it is feasible. The strategy for moving reluctant taxpayers to digital should be transparent and widely communicated." "we do not agree that certain taxpayers (e.g. employers) should be required/forced to use digital services.. Digital services should be about making it easier for taxpayers to get things done for their own convenience." 49 Proposed changes It is proposed that the threshold for electronic filing, using either payroll software or the internet-based portal, should be reduced from $100,000 a year to $50,000 of PAYE and ESCT. This figure would increase the percentage of employers required to file digitally from 12 percent to 22 percent. It would require an employer with more than ten full time employees at the minimum wage, or more than four full time employees at the average wage, to file electronically. A process for obtaining an exemption would remain, and would focus on whether the employer is unable to access digital services. Inability to access digital services might be defined as an absence of possible access in that location (for example no suitable internet services are available) or alternatively, that the employer does not already have a device that they use to connect to the internet for business/organisational purposes. Feedback on how inability to access digital services should be defined is sought in the questions that follow. It has been suggested that the threshold should be based on staff numbers rather than the dollar value of PAYE and ESCT deductions. While increased complexity is often what drives an employer’s decision to invest in digital systems, in the context of flexible working arrangements with part time and casual staff it is not clear how a staff number threshold would be operationalised by Inland Revenue. Comment from readers is invited in the questions which follow. exemption from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue,¹⁷ dates from the introduction of the employer monthly schedule in 1999. Electronic filing means either: • using payroll software to complete an electronic version of the employer monthly schedule and using ir-File and the internet to send the information to Inland Revenue; or • typing information into the onscreen form on Inland Revenue’s website and using ir-File to send it over the internet to Inland Revenue. In 1999, the threshold for electronic filing was set at $100,000 of PAYE and ESCT a year. Since 1999, the availability and use of digital services has increased dramatically and more than 60 percent of employers who are not currently required to file their employer monthly schedule electronically nevertheless do so. Access to and use of the internet by New Zealand businesses is known to be influenced by geographic location¹⁹and demographic factors such as the age of the business operator.²⁰ It may also be that some employers including non-profits, may not have any access to digital services. It is therefore considered reasonable that there should continue to be an exemption provision for employers who do not have access to digital services. Research by Sapere based on Statistics New Zealand’s 2012 Business Operations Survey found that 96 percent of businesses with more than 5 employees have access to the internet with 90 percent of them using it for financial services (assumed to be internet banking) and approximately 75 percent using it to interact with government. ¹⁸ 50 services depend on PAYE information being provided to Inland Revenue at the same time as the business process occurs. Feedback is welcomed on the three possible implementation approaches discussed below. Voluntary-first approach Under a “voluntary-first” approach, legislation would be amended to allow employers to meet their PAYE obligations by submitting PAYE information when their business processes occur (for example, when the payroll is run). Submitting PAYE information on this basis would eliminate the need to file an employer monthly schedule. After a range of payroll software packages and services with the new PAYE services have become available, and following significant voluntary uptake, the situation would be reviewed. The review would examine the experience of employers who have The requirement to file employer monthly schedule information electronically is included in section 36A (2B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and can only be changed by a law change. At a time when the use of digital services is rapidly increasing, it is proposed that the legislative framework for adjusting the threshold should be more flexible. The power to update the threshold could be given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Alternatively, it could require an Order in Council. Giving the power to the Commissioner could be seen as a logical extension of her current power to prescribe forms and formats, including for classes of employers. If instead a change to the threshold required an Order in Council, it would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. prOviding paYe infOrmatiOn when the business prOcess Occurs - implementatiOn OptiOns As outlined in Chapter 4, many of the proposed benefits from better PAYE questiOns fOr readers 5.1 Provided a straightforward internet portal exists do you agree that employers with more than $50,000 a year of PAYE and ESCT obligations should be required to file PAYE information electronically? 5.2 If you believe the threshold for electronic filing should be based on something other than the value of PAYE and ESCT deductions please describe how the alternative would work and where you think the threshold should be? 5.3 Are there factors, other than inability to access digital services, which should be grounds for an exemption from a requirement to file PAYE information electronically? 5.4 How should “inability to access digital services” be defined for the purposes of an exemption to a requirement to file PAYE information electronically? 5.5 Do you think there should be a more flexible framework under which changes to the threshold for electronic filing are considered in future? 5.6 If you think so, which of the options outlined above do you p re f e r?

She uses a wages book to manually calculate the weekly pay for her employees before adding it up over the month and returning it to Inland Revenue on a paper employer monthly schedule. Under the voluntary-first approach she would be able to listen to those she knows who are using the new PAYE services and decide if she wants to adopt payroll software, either a service or package, which can provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurs. If she continued to use a wages book and file on paper, and a subsequent review of the costs and benefits of the new digital services justified requiring employers\* to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs, Mary would have some choices. She could choose whether to continue to manually calculate the payroll and because she is below the electronic filing threshold, she could continue to provide the PAYE information on paper. She would, however, have to submit PAYE information each week rather than once a month. If she decided not to use payroll software, or a payroll service or an intermediary, she may find internet filing through the portal a better option than posting weekly returns. \*with the exception of those who could not access digital services. to say when a sufficient proportion of employers would be providing PAYE information on the new basis to enable the expected wider system gains to be achieved. Legislated approach A second approach would be for the Government to set a time-line identifying when employers will have to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs. Legislation would be amended to: • Allow employers, from the implementation date, to meet their obligations by submitting PAYE information when they run their business processes. • Require employers, by a specified future date, to provide information when they run the related business process. This requirement could be staged for different classes of employers, and would exempt or partially exempt those who cannot use digital services. This approach would clearly signal a timeframe to employers and would be an incentive for overseas-based software providers to support the upgrade of their products. The legislated approach would leave “Mary” the employer in the previous example with the same choices. The difference is that she would know from the time the legislation was passed when the deadline would be for her to begin submitting PAYE information on a weekly basis. adopted the new digital services and the reasons why others have chosen not to use them. If the Government considers the costs and benefits to the system as a whole justify change, and a legislative response is appropriate, employers would then be required to provide PAYE information when the business processes occur. This requirement would: • Provide a sufficient lead-in period to allow systems changes to be made. The implementation period could be different for different- sized employers. Twelve to twenty four months has been suggested by some large employers as the minimum timeframe they would require. • Exempt or substantially exempt employers who could not use digital services to meet the new requirements. Other employers, below the digital filing threshold, could continue to use paper to provide PAYE information but would be required to submit their PAYE information more frequently. A voluntary-first approach would create the right incentives for Inland Revenue and software providers to make the new digital services easy to use and beneficial to employers. It would also provide an opportunity to learn from experience before consideration is given to requiring employers to change the way they provide PAYE information. The downside is that it would be hard 52 delay to benefit realisation would be limited. Relevant considerations It is not proposed that the due dates for PAYE information would change in the initial voluntary stage of each of the possible approaches outlined above. An employer which chose to send PAYE information at the time of the business process would be meeting their current obligations (to file PAYE information for the month by the 5th or 20th of the following month) by submitting information progressively. If, under any of the alternative approaches, employers came to be required to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs, the question of due dates would require further consideration to reflect the new obligations. The previous options for implementation have been framed in terms of requiring the employer to provide information at the time the business process occurs. Focusing on when information is provided reflects the feedback that some small employers with simple payrolls may wish to continue to use paper forms to meet their obligations and should not be compelled to use the new digital services. An alternative approach is for the Government to require employers to adopt payroll software and use it to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs. If you think this approach is preferable Setting out an explicit timeframe in legislation would provide more certainty for employers and would give the Government more confidence about when wider system benefits would be achieved. The trade-off for greater certainty would be less time for learning from experience and no explicit reassessment of costs and benefits in the light of that experience. Review approach A review option would take a middle path. Amending the legislation would permit employers to meet their obligations by submitting PAYE information when the business process occurs. In addition there would be an obligation for a review of the costs and benefits and the experience of those adopting the new digital services within a stated period. The period might, for example, be between 12 to 36 months after the legislation takes effect. The review would operate in the same way as the voluntary-first option but the review would be time-tabled from the outset. It would provide an opportunity to evaluate progress before revisiting the question of whether employers should be required to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs. Unlike the legislated approach, there would be an explicit review of the costs and benefits of providing PAYE information at the time of the business process. By limiting the period before the question is reviewed, the possible questiOns fOr readers 5.7 Do you agree that Government needs to be able to balance the employer’s interest in choosing how to provide PAYE information against the wider system benefits? 5.8 Do you think Government should require employers to use payroll software capable of providing PAYE information at the time of the business process? 5.9 If you prefer one or other of the outlined implementation approaches to the provision of PAYE information at the time of the business process (voluntary-first, review or legislated) please identify your preferred option. 5.10 If you would prefer another approach entirely please outline it. 5 .11 If you support the ‘review approach’ how long after it first becomes possible to meet PAYE obligations by submitting PAYE information at the time of the business process, should the review o ccur? 5.12 If your answer to any of the above questions would vary depending on an employer’s size or other characteristics, please outline the considerations you think are relevant. 5.13 If you were required to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs, would you seek to change the frequency with which you paid your staff? 53 small and medium-sized emplOYers 58 percent of small and medium- sized employers (109,289) have less than 5 employees; they employ 6 percent of employees. 23 percent of employers (44,201) have between 5 – 10 employees; they employ 8 percent of employees. 16 percent of employers (30,451) have between 11 -50 employees, they employ 17 percent of employees. the Better digital services discussion document and early discussion with some large employers suggests a minimum of 12 – 24 months’ notice would be required. small and medium-sized emplOYers Early engagement with employers and discussions with software providers indicate that software providers servicing SMEs are likely to be first to make software available that can submit PAYE information at the time the business process occurs. The Government recognises that employers will vary in their willingness to adopt or upgrade to software that supports the new digital services. Early adopters will move quickly, or will be moved when their service provider adopts the new services, while others will wait to see how the services are received. For small employers, doing the payroll is often the role of the business owner or a family member. While simple software which automates functions could be expected to be attractive, cost may be a barrier. So too could be the need to set time aside to learn a new way of doing things. For small and medium employers that do not adopt payroll software but can access digital services, the proposed new portal providing an on- line channel to submit information, is intended as a suitable option. Employers not using payroll software but with digital access could use the please provide feedback to that effect. It is possible that requiring employers to submit PAYE information at the time the business process occurs may incentivise some employers to consider changing the frequency with which they run their payroll - for example, to change from fortnightly to monthly. This would be undesirable. The statistical snapshots and categorisation of issues which follows reflects feedback already provided. It is not intended to be definitive or exclusive and some employers may identify with issues across several categories. large emplOYers and bespOke sYstems Large employers, including large public-sector organisations, often have customised business systems and complex payrolls that require significant lead times for change. The core technology in these systems is often supplied by overseas corporations that may be unwilling to support upgrades in response to developments in the New Zealand market unless it is a legal requirement to do so. There are also employers using “bespoke” payroll systems they have developed themselves.

Simple payrolls Almost 45,000 employers have only one employee. subsidy to make a free payroll service available. To retain eligibility for the subsidy it is likely that after a transition period listed payroll intermediaries would have to upgrade their services to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs. Feedback on the Better digital services discussion document showed mixed support for further subsidies; some submitters were opposed and others suggested the existing payroll subsidy might need to be extended. Some submitters made the point that some employers have such simple payrolls that the cost and effort of transferring to a software- based system cannot be justified. Alternatives for these employers are addressed below. Those with very simple payrolls A significant number of New Zealand employers are very small. Some find payroll software appropriate and affordable and it is expected that the new digital services will attract more. A simple payroll, perhaps available as an app over a mobile phone or tablet, is likely to be an attractive option for some very small employers. As previously noted, an upgraded portal will be available for employers to upload or enter their PAYE information. To submit payroll information through a portal would require internet access. This could be achieved from an internet connected computer or through a mobile portal to receive PAYE information from Inland Revenue and to submit the following information: • a decision to begin to employ; • details of new and ceased employees; • pay day information about PAYE and other deductions; • amendments to PAYE information; and • a decision to permanently or temporarily cease to be an employer. Cost as a barrier For some employers, especially smaller ones, the cost of adopting payroll software or upgrading their software, may be a barrier to benefitting from the proposed new PAYE services. With over 50 different payroll providers active in the New Zealand market it is expected there will be competition between providers which should limit the cost of payroll software and the cost of upgrades. Under a government programme, a payroll subsidy is available to employers with less than $500,000 a year of PAYE deductions (including ESCT). The subsidy discounts the cost of payroll services by $2 per employee each pay period, for up to five employees, provided the employer uses a listed payroll intermediary.

Small non-profit organisations are likely to combine payroll responsibilities with other duties, and payroll responsibilities may even be discharged by a volunteer. paY r O ll b u r e aus, paY r O ll intermediaries and Other third parties Some employers use third parties such as bookkeepers, accountants, payroll bureaus or payroll intermediaries to run their payroll and pay staff. In the case of payroll intermediaries the third party takes over the employer’s legal obligations to Inland Revenue. Third parties play an important role in the PAYE system as they free the employer from these processes, while bringing a professional level of skills and knowledge to these tasks. In general the proposed new digital services should work for third parties as they do for employers. The information that could be provided through business software to Inland Revenue at the same time the payroll runs is a subset of the information that the third party needs to run the payroll. There may, however, be some situations when the proposed new digital services might work less well. For example, a third party might not hold the full range of employee details that it is proposed would be required by Inland Revenue to set the employee up correctly from the beginning, or near the beginning of employment. It is recognised that a third party may connection. Feedback on the Better digital services discussion document identified the importance of ensuring that those who cannot use digital services are still able use other services to meet their obligations. This discussion document responds to those concerns by proposing that paper forms would remain as a filing option, for the foreseeable future. The option would be available to those who cannot access digital services and also for employers, below the threshold for digital filing to whom none of the digital options are attractive. If providing PAYE information when the business process occurs becomes a requirement, those small employers who have digital access and who choose to continue to submit their PAYE information on paper would have to submit PAYE information more frequently. Because of the time taken to receive and process paper these employers would be unlikely to fully benefit from the process changes outlined in Chapter 4. nOt-fOr-prOfit sectOr The not-for-profit sector includes registered charities and entities such as sports clubs, associations and societies whose activities are not carried out for the gain or profit of any member.

If there is a general requirement to provide information at the time of the business process, it is proposed that employers exempt from that requirement would be required to submit information that reflects the detail of what was actually paid and deducted each pay day, but they would only have to submit the information once a month. Because of the benefits that would arise from earlier provision of PAYE information, it is further proposed that in the event that there is a general requirement to provide PAYE information at the time of the business process, employers who have an exemption would be required to provide the information by the 5th, rather than the 20th, of the month following the month in which PAYE deductions were withheld. The monthly submission would also include details of new employees and the employer would have the option of advising of amendments to previously provided PAYE information in the monthly submission, or earlier. ir56 taxpaYers Currently, certain types of employees are responsible for paying their own PAYE instead of their employer being required to deduct PAYE from their earnings. These employees are known as “IR56 taxpayers” and include private domestic workers, embassy staff, New Zealand-based representatives of overseas companies, and United States Antarctic Program personnel. play different roles, such as being a nominated person for one taxpayer and a person with delegations of authority for another. The current processes to manage different roles are often convoluted, requiring client input and multiple logons. It is intended that a single customer will be able to have multiple roles but maintain a single identity with Inland Revenue. thOse unable tO access digital services Implementation approaches discussed earlier, propose that those unable to use digital services to meet their PAYE obligations would be exempt, or partially exempt, from any requirement to provide PAYE information at the same time the business process occurs. Employers operating in rural areas without broadband internet or mobile phone coverage are an obvious example of a customer group who lack digital access. It is proposed that the exemption process would require an application to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Significant advantages for the Government and social policy recipients would be derived from PAYE information being provided on disaggregated basis showing what has been deducted each pay day. Employers already calculate this information as part of doing the pay and are required to retain the information. Under the current system these pay day records are added together, either by software or manually and submitted the following questiOn fOr readers 5. 21 Are there additional issues that need to be considered when thinking about how the proposed new PAYE services would work for third parties such as bookkeepers, accountants, payroll bureaus and payroll intermediaries? what YOu tOld us "\[We\] agree that customers' needs vary ...Areas that are not covered by internet services will be disadvantaged." questiOns fOr readers 5.22 If there is a general requirement to provide PAYE information when the business process occurs, is it reasonable to expect employers who have an exemption because they cannot use digital services, to nonetheless provide disaggregated PAYE (pay day) information? 5.23 If there is a general requirement to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs, is it reasonable to expect that exempt employers should be required to provide PAYE information by the 5 th of the following month? 57 For IR56 taxpayers, continuing to operate on a monthly PAYE cycle is probably sufficient. Digital solutions may allow an option for these taxpayers to operate on a weekly or fortnightly basis. IR56 taxpayers will likely be able to provide their PAYE information via a digital portal on Inland Revenue’s website, although, as previously mentioned, it is proposed that a paper channel will remain open for the foreseeable future. There is a question about whether the timeframe an IR56 taxpayer has for providing their PAYE information to Inland Revenue should be reduced. In the previous section, it was proposed that, in the event that there is a general requirement for employers to provide PAYE information at the same time the business process occurs, employers who have an exemption would be required to provide the information by the 5th, rather than the 20th, of the month following the month in which PAYE deductions were withheld. To be consistent, IR56 taxpayers could be dealt with in the same way, and be required to provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue by the 5th, rather than the 20th, of the month following payment. Earlier PAYE information from IR56 taxpayers might also be important for future improvements to the delivery of social policy. On the other hand, there may be less compelling reasons for requiring IR56 taxpayers to provide their PAYE information to Inland Revenue earlier. Delayed PAYE information from employers could mean that their employees are denied the benefits a modern IR56 taxpayers are currently required to file an employer monthly schedule (IR348) and employer deductions form (IR345), and pay the PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue, by the 20th of the month following receipt of payment from their employer(s). Inland Revenue receiving (near) real-time PAYE information is crucial for realising the Government’s vision for a modern tax administration. Real-time information at the point of payment is, however, incompatible with the recipient of the payment being responsible for providing the information. Proposal While imposing relatively onerous tax compliance obligations on individual employees is generally not desirable, employers of private domestic workers may be even less well equipped to fulfil PAYE compliance obligations. PAYE compliance obligations could not be enforced against foreign states, and may be difficult to enforce against non- resident companies that do not have a substantial presence in New Zealand. Furthermore, making the employee responsible for fulfilling the PAYE obligations, allows them to add all their payments from their numerous employers together and calculate PAYE deductions monthly using one of the “M” tax codes (assuming they do not have another “M” tax code job). For these reasons, the Government proposes that IR56 taxpayers continue to be responsible for submitting their own PAYE information, and paying their own PAYE deductions, to Inland Revenue. 58 tax administration could deliver. By contrast, delayed PAYE information from IR56 taxpayers would not have this negative impact. questiOns fOr readers 5.24 Do you agree that IR56 taxpayers should remain responsible for submitting their own PAYE information and paying their own PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue, rather than their employers? 5.25 Do you think that IR56 taxpayers should have to provide their PAYE information to Inland Revenue earlier (for example, by the 5th of the following month), or do you think that by the 20th of the month following payment is still sufficient? ¹⁷ Sections 36A(2B) and 36B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ¹⁸ The value of internet services to New Zealand businesses 2014.

This chapter explores the possibility of aligning the payment to Inland Revenue of PAYE deductions and related payments with the payment of employees’ salary and wages. As previously discussed, under the current PAYE system employers withhold PAYE and related deductions, such as child support, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions, from salary and wages when they pay their employees. They hold this withheld amount for a period of time before they are required to pay it to Inland Revenue. Integrating the remittance process with other PAYE business processes (payment of employees, withholding PAYE deductions, remittance and providing information to Inland Revenue) at the same time has the potential to reduce an employer’s compliance and administrative costs. It could also provide others (such as recipients of child support and the Crown) with prompter payments. KiwiSaver deductions could also be passed on faster and it may improve compliance by removing the possibility of employers getting into difficulties by using PAYE held in trust to cover other expenses. The Government is interested in receiving feedback from employers and other interested parties on whether employers should make PAYE and related payments to Inland Revenue at the same time, and as part of the business process of paying their employees. current paYe paYment ObligatiOns An employer’s PAYE obligations can broadly be described as deducting PAYE from an employee’s wages each pay day, providing the information on the employee’s gross wages and deductions to Inland Revenue once a month, and paying the withheld PAYE amount to Inland Revenue once or twice monthly. Whether an employer is required to pay PAYE to Inland Revenue monthly or twice-monthly depends on the employer’s annual PAYE (including ESCT) payments. Small employers chapTer 6 paYe – aligning paYMenTs 60 be a separate process and was aligned with the timing and process of paying salary and wages to employees, this could provide the following improvements: • PAYE and deductions of KiwiSaver contributions, student loan repayments and child support payments could be passed on to individuals and the Crown more quickly. • Employers would be less likely to get into financial difficulties by using amounts they hold in trust to cover other expenses. • Employers that are having problems meeting payment obligations would be identified earlier so earlier support could be provided, which would improve compliance. • Lower compliance costs by eliminating the separate process involved in remitting PAYE payment to Inland Revenue. Together with the proposal for providing PAYE information to Inland Revenue on a pay day basis discussed in previous parts of this discussion document, an employer could have one combined pay day process of paying their staff, paying PAYE deductions and providing the associated PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the same time. This combined pay day process could become part of the business payroll process and make PAYE processes simpler and reduce compliance costs whose annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $500,000 are required to pay PAYE once monthly, by the 20 th of the following month. Large employers whose annual gross PAYE and ESCT is $500,000 or more are required to pay PAYE twice-monthly, on the 20 th of the same month for deductions made during the 1 st to the 15 th of the month, and on the 5 th of the following month for deductions made during the 16 th to the end of the month. All employers have the advantage of interest on the PAYE deductions they hold between the time they pay salaries and wages to their employees and the time they pay the PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue (time value of money). This period is generally between 20 to 50 days for small employers and between 5 to 20 days for large employers. The delayed PAYE payment offsets some of the employer’s costs incurred in complying with their PAYE obligations. However, it also creates an additional compliance process and costs. The PAYE payment must be accompanied by an “employer deductions” form. The form records the total PAYE and the totals for each of the other categories of deductions and contributions. These might include, for example, any KiwiSaver, child support and student loan deductions, KiwiSaver employer contributions or ESCT deductions. making paYe paYments On a paY daY basis If the process of making PAYE payments to Inland Revenue ceased to 61 However, employers who currently choose to keep a separate bank account to set aside PAYE deductions may, under the proposal, be able to save account maintenance costs previously associated with such a separate account. PAYE payment on a pay day basis would also reduce the risk of PAYE payment default. PAYE deductions made by an employer are from money belonging to the employee. They are to discharge the tax liability of the employee to the Crown. PAYE deducted is money that the employer holds in trust until it must be paid to Inland Revenue. Despite this some employers use PAYE deductions as working capital for their business. Sometimes an employer may not be in a position to pay the deducted PAYE to Inland Revenue, in which case penalties and recovery action will follow, with a possible significant effect on the business involved. Failing to pay PAYE is a serious offence and can result in prosecution. PAYE payment on a pay day basis would reduce the risk of payment default and its consequences. If pay day payment was adopted, an unintended consequence may be that cash flow considerations and additional transaction fees influence some employers’ preferences on the frequency with which they pay their staff. Chapter 5 discussed the Government’s proposal that IR56 taxpayers continue to be responsible for submitting their own PAYE information and paying their own PAYE deductions to and risks for employers. For example, if PAYE information and payments are all derived directly from the payroll the step of submitting an employer deduction form may be able to be eliminated. The question arises as to whether the proposal that PAYE deductions should be remitted to Inland Revenue on a pay day basis should only proceed if information is also provided on a pay day basis. The Government is interested in hearing readers’ views on this point. Any move to pay day payment of PAYE would, however, involve a trade-off between these benefits and the current benefit employers have in retaining PAYE and related deductions until it must be paid to Inland Revenue. Some employers may value a reduction in compliance costs and effort rather than the benefit provided by the delayed PAYE payment. However, some employers may rely on the benefit provided by the current PAY E r u l e s . PAYE payment on a pay day basis would increase the frequency of payments to Inland Revenue for most employers. For example, a small employer who pays their staff fortnightly is currently required to pay the withheld PAYE to Inland Revenue once a month. If pay day payment was adopted they would pay PAYE to Inland Revenue each fortnight when they pay their staff. Any increase in PAYE payment frequency may increase employers’ costs associated with payment transactions (for example bank transaction fees). 62 Inland Revenue. It is also suggested that they continue to operate on a monthly PAYE cycle. The Government proposes that for IR56 taxpayers the timing of PAYE information provision and payment to Inland Revenue should continue to be aligned. This means that if IR56 taxpayers continue to be required to file PAYE information monthly, this monthly cycle would also continue to apply to PAYE payments they are required to make to Inland Revenue. If the due date in the following month for providing their PAYE information is earlier, the due date for payment of PAYE deductions could be aligned with this earlier date to retain alignment of information and payment due dates. questiOns fOr readers 6 .1 Should the timing and process of employers’ PAYE payment obligations be aligned with the process of paying salary and wages to employees? 6.2 Do you think this alignment would increase or reduce compliance costs and effort?

It accounts for 32 percent of total tax revenue collected, with 21 percent collected by Inland Revenue and 11 percent by Customs. The Government considers that the current GST rules are working well overall. New Zealand’s GST system is regarded throughout the world as a model consumption tax. It is broad- based – meaning that it applies to a wide range of goods and services with very few exemptions. It is therefore relatively simple and easy to comply with compared with other countries’ systems. This is reflected in the relative simplicity of the GST filing and return processes. In line with the broad-base framework, the Government has recently released a discussion document GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods seeking submissions on proposed new rules that would apply GST to cross-border services and intangibles and is also seeking feedback on the collection of GST on goods. Inland Revenue has also recently published an officials’ issue paper GST – Current Issues on a range of specific technical and remedial GST issues raised mainly by private sector stakeholders. As part of this discussion document on how the way GST information is provided can be simplified, the Government is not proposing to make changes to the legislation on how and when to account for or pay GST. However, despite the relative simplicity of our GST system, there are compliance costs incurred by registered persons accounting for GST and filing GST returns – for example, through performing GST calculations, seeking advice, record-keeping, filing returns and making GST payments. The proposals for GST can improve the processes for how customers provide GST information and how they communicate with Inland Revenue, reducing compliance costs for GST-registered persons as well as administrative costs for the system overall. As such, proposals for GST involve process changes rather than changes to the GST rules. This chapter presents a proposal on how to create an easier, cheaper and more effective system for customers to comply with their GST information and payment obligations by: • simplifying the process of chapTer 7 gsT – Modernising how inforMaTion is provided 64 GST-registered persons must file a GST return for each taxable period. A person’s taxable period is one, two or six months, depending on the amount of taxable supplies made in a 12-month period, or in some cases, on the election of the GST-registered person. Generally, a taxable period ends on the last day of a month. However, a registered person can apply to use a different end-date to their taxable period up to seven days before or after the end of the month. This provides some flexibility to allow registered persons to adopt a taxable period which is consistent with their accounting procedures or tax balance date. GST returns must be filed along with any payment by the 28 th of the month following the end of the taxable period (with two exceptions for November and March). current gst infOrmatiOn cOllectiOn channels and prOcesses GST was introduced in 1986 using paper-based return filing. Since then, the way New Zealanders run their businesses has changed significantly. This is reflected in the channels currently made available by Inland Revenue to file GST returns. Today GST returns can be filed electronically for example, via myIR (also referred to as e-GST), mobile application and E-File (data transmitted from a tax agent’s computer system), as well as through paper-based returns. providing GST information to Inland Revenue by integrating it with processes and systems used to run the business; and • as a consequence improving the quality of GST information provided to Inland Revenue by businesses and individuals. It also describes how new integrated services could contribute to faster processing of GST refunds. gst sYstem and ObligatiOns GST is a consumption tax on most goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Taxpayers that are GST- registered with Inland Revenue collect GST from their customers on behalf of the Government by charging GST on their sales (known as output tax) and claiming back a tax credit on their purchases and expenses (known as input tax). GST-registered “persons”, can be businesses, non-profit bodies or individuals. They calculate the difference between the GST they charge on their sales and the GST they pay on their expenses to work out if they have to make a GST payment or receive a refund from Inland Revenue. GST is based on a system of self- assessment. It is the responsibility of registered persons to calculate the amount of GST output tax they are required to pay and any input tax deductions they are eligible to receive, and provide this information to Inland Revenue by way of a GST return. 65 The calculation of GST can also add to compliance costs. Manual calculations can result in errors, leaving registered persons exposed to the risk of penalties. It also affects efficiency and results in additional costs to registered persons as well as Inland Revenue in fixing these errors. Furthermore, the time and effort involved in communicating with Inland Revenue imposes costs on registered persons. Some seek confirmation from Inland Revenue that their return has been received and others seek advice or progress reporting on the payment of refunds. From 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015, over 2.8 million GST returns were filed. More than 64 percent of registered persons filed their returns electronically during this period of time, compared with more than 53 percent for the 2013–14 financial year. However, a significant number of GST returns (35.3 percent) are still filed on paper. Creating and filing a GST return and paying GST involves time and effort. The majority of registered persons have to transcribe GST information from their accounts (paper-based or digital) to their preferred GST filing channels; information cannot be transferred automatically and must be re-entered manually. gst returns filed august 2014 tO julY 2015 35.3% (934,350) PAPER 10.6% (290,143) E-FILE 13.8% (376,872) WEB 4 0. 3% (1,093, 275) myIR INCLUDING MOBILE APP 64.7% elecTronic reTurns (1,760, 290) 66 using integrated accOunting sOftware tO prOvide gst infOrmatiOn The central proposal for simplifying the way GST information is provided is to create a new channel that allows direct interaction between the accounting software people use to run their business or organisation, and Inland Revenue’s systems. The proposed new channel would offer opportunities to simplify the way GST information is provided. Early consultation suggests that the new digital services would particularly appeal to small and medium-sized customers, as some large GST- registered businesses have indicated that they do not use their accounting software to calculate their GST obligations. Reducing time, effort and costs The proposal would allow registered persons to provide GST information to Inland Revenue directly from their integrated accounting software used as part of their business processes rather than producing and filing a GST return as a separate manual process. This would remove the need to duplicate or transcribe information from business systems to the current GST return and reduce the GST compliance burden for registered persons by eliminating or automating some activities and processes. It would also mitigate the costs and risks associated with manual intervention. Once the GST information has been received by Inland Revenue systems, a confirmation of acceptance could be sent to the customer through their integrated accounting software. This should provide greater certainty and confidence to customers and would eliminate the need some customers feel to contact Inland Revenue for confirmation. The diagram on the next page shows how the proposal would work. Providing GST information to Inland Revenue will not be an automated process, but will involve a “submit information now” step. Registered persons will continue to be required to self-assess (determine the amount of GST payable by or refundable to them for the taxable period) and provide a return setting out the amount of GST payable by them. The submission of a GST return is creating an assessment and should be a deliberate step, where the registered person is still in control of the submission of their GST information. A significant number of GST-registered persons use third parties, such as tax agents, tax advisors, accountants or bookkeepers, to help them with meeting their GST obligations. About a third of GST returns filed with Inland Revenue are filed by tax agents. The professional services that tax agents and other third parties provide to their clients make a significant contribution to the quality of returns and hence compliance. Generally, the proposed new digital services are expected to provide the same benefits to third parties submitting GST information on behalf of their clients as they will for GST-registered persons themselves. rOb - small business Owner Rob runs a plumbing business.

The digital services effectively give me a GST return, but there is no button marked "submit to IRD" or "submit and pay." Improving the quality of GST information Under current systems GST returns often require manual intervention and “rework” before GST information can be processed and used by Inland Revenue. This is because the GST return is often incomplete, contains errors or is unreadable. Time and effort is involved, both for registered persons and Inland Revenue, in identifying and fixing these errors. The proposal to enable direct interaction between a business’s integrated accounting system and Inland Revenue’s systems presents an opportunity to eliminate or reduce some of the current error sources. It also allows for improvements to the quality of GST information provided by taxpayers and collected by Inland Revenue. GST information will be more accurate and reliable, because errors that occur under the current processes are reduced. An improvement in the quality of GST information would reduce the compliance effort and cost for taxpayers, as well as the administration costs of the tax system. More reliable GST information would improve the effective use of available information for both customers and Inland Revenue.

Are there additional issues that need to be considered when thinking about how the proposed new digital services would work for third parties, such as tax agents, tax advisors, accountants and bookkeepers, in relation to the provision of GST information? proposes to achieve this through more integrated and streamlined information flows and enabling better use of information. This also involves consideration of the information needed to ensure the tax administration system operates effectively and to explore whether the information currently collected is sufficient for a modernised tax administration. For GST the return is the key source of information provided to Inland Revenue. A GST return contains the registered person’s self-assessment of the amount of GST payable or refundable for the taxable period. The information collection framework for GST has not significantly changed since the introduction of GST in 1986. At this point Government is not suggesting any changes to the information required through a GST return although it may in the future consider this. It is, however, envisaged that under the new digital services a registered person will be able to attach accompanying documents or correspondence to a GST return if they wish. They will, for example, have the opportunity to attach documentation on an unusually large input tax claim to support the GST return. This could have an impact on the speed of processing the return and may result in the input tax claim being released faster. However, attaching additional documentation to a GST return will be on a voluntary basis. The GST filing option through myIR currently includes a feature that helps 69 customers with their GST adjustments calculation. This information is then submitted through myIR as part of the GST return process. It is proposed that the new service include a similar feature for the calculation of GST adjustments. Payment of GST The payment of GST is currently aligned with the due date for GST information (the GST return). It is not proposed to make any changes to GST payment frequencies. The proposal for enabling direct interaction between a business’s integrated accounting system and Inland Revenue’s system does, however, provide new opportunities for simplifying the making of GST payments and for streamlining the receipt of input tax. It is envisaged that accounting software offering the new digital services will have enhanced payment solutions that make it faster and easier for registered persons to make a GST payment. This may include a link from the GST information submission process to a payment routine that will allow payment of the GST amount due. This would also allow faster acknowledgement of payment. Implementing the change It is intended that new GST services will be able to run on a wide variety of platforms, including through a desktop, in the “cloud”, accessed through a browser, a mobile application or on new platforms that may emerge in the future. The Better digital services discussion document identified the importance of ensuring that taxpayers who cannot use new digital services can still use other channels to comply with their tax obligations. It is proposed that paper filing will remain available as a way to submit a GST return for the foreseeable future. Simple solutions will be available for very small GST- registered persons, for whom the cost of entry level accounting software may be a barrier for example, in the form of an improved portal for the online submission of their GST returns. To ensure a diverse range of products that support the proposed new digital services, Inland Revenue has started work with software providers so that they can design software which will support the new digital services. An “early release” of services allowing direct submission of GST information from some integrated accounting software to Inland Revenue systems is envisaged for December 2015. Functionality, such as attaching documents to GST returns, would likely be added in subsequent releases. Small and medium GST-registered persons are likely to be the main group of early adopters. Early feedback from some large enterprises has indicated that they do not expect material benefit from the proposed changes. This is because their GST return processes are often largely manual and managed through different accounting systems. This is especially so for financial institutions whose core business is generally exempt from GST. 70 A GST-registered person’s decision whether to adopt the new digital services to submit their GST information does not have a direct effect on third parties or the delivery of social policy. In addition, the Government is committed to the objective that a change to the way GST information is provided should minimise compliance costs. It is therefore proposed that the decision to adopt the new digital services for providing GST information should be, for the foreseeable future at least, voluntary. This creates incentives for Inland Revenue and software providers to make the new GST services easy, cost-effective and beneficial to GST-registered persons. direct crediting Of gst refunds As part of modernising the administration of GST, the Government proposes that GST refunds are only to be made by direct credit into customers’ nominated bank accounts in New Zealand, unless it would cause undue hardship to a customer or is not practicable. This proposal could speed up the GST refund process, reduce compliance costs for business and decrease administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Current refund process Currently Inland Revenue makes most GST refunds through direct crediting into a registered person’s bank account in New Zealand and through issuing cheques. The majority of Inland Revenue’s customers prefer direct crediting as a safe, secure and questiOns fOr readers 7. 3 Do you support the proposal that adopting the new digital services should be voluntary for GST information? 7. 4 Would you take up the new GST services? If your answer is “it depends”, what does it depend on? convenient way of receiving refunds. Currently Inland Revenue makes about two-thirds of all GST refunds through direct crediting and one-third through cheques. For a refund by cheque it takes on average 10 working days from the time a GST refund is released to the time the funds are available to the customer. A GST refund that is released for payment and is direct credited into the customer’s bank account is generally available to the customer in two days. Eighty percent of all GST refunds made by cheques are for clients of tax agents. Inland Revenue has recently contacted agents who receive a large number of cheques on behalf of their clients. A significant majority of these agents indicated that they would agree to change to receiving refunds by direct credit into bank accounts of their clients. The Tax Administration Act 1994²² provides for the progressive implementation of compulsory direct crediting of tax refunds for the various types of tax administered by Inland Revenue by Order in Council. This provision was enacted with effect from 1 April 2000 as part of a major tax simplification package. It was intended that it would eventually apply to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue. The measure benefits customers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system, time taken to clear funds between banks, and by eliminating costs relating to the banking of cheques. There is also a benefit to Inland Revenue in terms of reduced administration 71 costs. Compulsory direct crediting has already been implemented for donations tax credits. Proposed change The Government proposes to extend compulsory direct crediting to GST refunds. Receiving refunds straight into bank accounts could mean money will reach customers faster, customers do not need to bank the cheque and there is no waiting for the cheque to clear. Nevertheless, it may sometimes be necessary to make a GST refund by cheque or other means, so an exemption to this rule would be available if a customer experiences undue hardship or direct crediting is not practicable. Making GST refunds by other means, such as cheques, would be considered on a case-by- case basis. electrOnic submissiOn Of gst infOrmatiOn fOr sOme registered persOns Effective, timely and accurate GST administration can best be achieved through the electronic transfer of information. To minimise compliance and administrative costs Inland Revenue has and will continue to encourage electronic methods for communicating with and providing information to Inland Revenue. Every year more GST registered persons choose to provide their GST information to Inland Revenue via electronic channels. As outlined earlier, the electronic filing rate for GST returns is relatively high, but a questiOns fOr readers 7. 5 Do you support the proposal that GST refunds should only be made by direct credit into a customer’s nominated bank account unless it would cause undue hardship to a customer or is not practicable? 7. 6 Do you think GST-registered persons over a certain threshold should be required to submit their GST information to Inland Revenue in an electronic format? 7. 7 At what level do you think such a threshold should be set? large number of GST returns are still filed on paper (over 35 percent of GST returns filed from August 2014 to July 2015). GST information submitted through electronic channels, rather than on paper, is faster and cheaper to process. While this discussion document does not propose compulsory adoption of the new digital services, the Government is interested in feedback on whether some GST-registered persons should be required to provide GST information in electronic format. Customers would comply with an electronic filing requirement if they submit their GST information through any electronic channel, new or existing. An electronic filing requirement could apply to registered persons over a certain threshold (for example, dependent on the total amount of taxable supplies made by the person in a 12-month period) so that these registered persons would be required to provide all GST information to Inland Revenue electronically. ²² Sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 72
The Government wants to make it easier for people to manage their tax obligations by using modern digital technology to provide faster, more accurate and convenient interactions with Inland Revenue. This discussion document continues the Government’s focus on finding out what New Zealanders want to see in our future modernised tax system. Specifically, this paper consults on proposals to design digital services for PAYE and GST that will, as much as possible, integrate tax requirements into the tasks that people would already be doing as part of running their business or organisation. There are approximately 190,000 employers who make PAYE payments to Inland Revenue on behalf of their employees, and 630,000 GST-registered persons and businesses. Meeting these obligations is a significant task for many, whether running a small business, a non- profit organisation or a larger company. I believe that the time that employers and those who are GST-registered take to meet their obligations is time they would prefer to use to advance their business – or spend with their family. Integrating PAYE and GST filing into business software could eliminate some processes and simplify others. While the proposals in this discussion document focus on how this might be done, it is recognised that some customers either cannot access digital services or do not use payroll or accounting software. Our starting point for the discussion is to minimise customers’ costs in providing PAYE and GST information, Inland Revenue’s costs to process the information, and in the case of PAYE, improve the timeliness, quality and usefulness of the information for everyone involved. More timely and better quality PAYE information would allow Inland Revenue to improve the accuracy of PAYE deductions. This, in turn, would improve individuals’ access to social policy entitlements. Better information would also provide an opportunity for the Government to make future improvement to the design and operation of social policies for New Zealanders. We are also consulting on a number of options for changing some of the PAYE rules that employers have told us are confusing or complex. This discussion document is your opportunity to tell the Government how you would like PAYE and GST to operate in the future. Please consider the proposals set out in in this paper and take some time to tell us what you think. The way you do your PAYE and GST could soon be a lot better as a result. Hon Todd McClay MINISTER OF REVENUE makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz BETTER ADMINISTRATION OF PAYE AND GST MAKING TAX SIMPLER Erin and Mike run a motel in a popular holiday destination. Erin does the books and the weekly payroll and supervises the staff. Two years ago they invested in a basic payroll package to calculate the wages but Erin still finds filing PAYE information a pain. Before the 20th of the following month, on a completely different cycle from her payroll, she files the previous month’s PAYE information from her payroll system, goes into myIR and uses ir-File to attach the information and then send it to Inland Revenue. What if Erin’s payroll package alerted her with a message when the payroll was finalised – “submit details to Inland Revenue?” and presented her with the information to be submitted? Erin could meet her PAYE information obligations there and then. PAYE – ERIN: Small business Sefa is a payroll officer for a construction firm. Turnover is relatively high amongst their labourers. When they first start Sefa spends a lot of time sorting out their tax codes and deductions. Some labourers have left before Sefa sorts their details and Inland Revenue keeps sending information about them after they have left. What if Sefa could use the payroll system to send the details of new employees to Inland Revenue and get an automatic response with their KiwiSaver status, and any required deductions - all before the business starts to pay them? This ensures he gets the new employee set up correctly right from the start. He could also use the payroll system to send a message to Inland Revenue when he takes an employee, who has left, off the payroll. This would stop Inland Revenue sending him further information about an ex-employee. PAYE – SEFA: Medium business THE PROPOSALS PAYE Better administration • Change PAYE to streamline some processes and eliminate others. • Employers could provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurs (for example, information about PAYE and deductions would be provided when the pay is calculated). Three alternative options to implement this change are proposed. • The PAYE electronic filing threshold for PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax would be lowered from $100,000 to $50,000 a year of PAYE and employers superannuation contribution tax, to reflect the increased use of electronic services by small and medium-sized employers. • Consider whether employers should send PAYE and related deductions to Inland Revenue at the same time they pay their employees. Modernising some PAYE rules We are also consulting on options to modernise rules for: • tax deducted from an extra pay • the tax treatment of holiday pay • withholding tax in years in which an extra pay day will occur • better accommodating a legislated rate-change across tax types CONSULTATION TIMELINE Rob runs a plumbing business and is GST- registered. He does all the admin and books himself, using accounting software. Rob enters all the information he needs to file his GST return into his accounting software. He files his GST return online through Inland Revenue’s myIR service. However, Rob is frustrated that every time he files a GST return he has to manually copy the information from his accounting software to the GST return form in myIR, needing to switch back and forth between screens. What if Rob’s accounting software would automatically pre-populate the GST information needed for his GST return and, after checking that all the information is there and correct, Rob could file his return with Inland Revenue directly from his accounting software? GST – ROB: Small business Better administration for GST • GST-registered persons could submit GST returns to Inland Revenue directly from their accounting software, rather than filing a GST return as a separate process. • Make GST refunds only by direct credit to a customer’s bank account unless it would cause undue hardship or is not practicable. • Consider whether some GST- registered persons over a certain threshold should be required to submit their GST returns electronically (through existing or new services). HAVE YOUR SAY Go to makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz to find out more about these proposals and to have your say. Some of these proposals would require changes to the law. If the proposals are passed by Parliament, Inland Revenue will communicate the changes to businesses well in advance of the changes coming into effect.

The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS Article 3 General Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term �person� includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (b) the term �company� means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (c) the term �enterprise� applies to the carrying on of any business; (d) the terms �enterprise of a Contracting State� and �enterprise of the other Contracting State� mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (e) the term �international traffic� means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (f) the term �competent authority� means: (i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; and (ii) in the case of Samoa, the CEO of the Ministry for Revenue or an authorised representative; (g) the term �national�, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; (h) the term �business� includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character; (i) the terms �a Contracting State� and �the other Contracting State� mean New Zealand or Samoa as the context requires; and (j) (i) the term �New Zealand� means the territory of New�Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; and (ii) the term �Samoa� means the Independent State of Samoa and its territorial waters. 2. For the purposes of Articles 10, 11 and 12, dividends, interest or royalties arising in a Contracting State and derived by or through a trust shall be deemed to be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State where: (a) such income is subject to tax in that other State in the hands of the trustee of that trust; (b) with reference to dividends, the income would be subject to tax in the hands of the trustee of that trust but for an exemption that applies to those dividends under the laws of that other State. 3. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. Article 4 Resident 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �resident of a Contracting State� means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of their domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows: (a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual�s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; (c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; (d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Article 5 Permanent Establishment 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �permanent establishment� means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term �permanent establishment� includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop, and (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if for more than 183 days in any twelve month period: (a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State: (a) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and where the services performed in that other State through that individual are professional services or other activities of an independent nature, or (b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make the fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with and are identical or substantially similar to the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term �permanent establishment� shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person � other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies � is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME Article 6 Income from Immovable Property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term �immovable property� shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise. 5. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. Article 7 Business Profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment, or sales in that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 5. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident�s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. Article 8 Ship and Air Transport 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. Article 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and (b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares and other income treated as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company�s undistributed profits to a tax on the company�s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. The term �interest� as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor�s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term �royalties� as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; (b) the use of, or the right to use: (i) motion picture films, (ii) films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio, internet or other broadcasting; (c) the use of, or the right to use any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; (d) knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or (b), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (c) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (d); (f) any forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 13 Alienation of Property 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. Article 14 Income from Employment 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the income year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and (c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. Article 15 Directors� Fees Directors� fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person�s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Article 16 Entertainers and Sportspersons 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person�s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person�s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. Article 17 Pensions 1. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. Article 18 Government Service 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such payments shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 or 16 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Government referred to in paragraph 1. Article 19 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. Article 20 Other Income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. Article 21 Entitlement to Benefits Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a benefit under this Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Agreement. CHAPTER IV ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Article 22 Elimination of Double Taxation 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Samoa tax paid under the laws of Samoa and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Samoa (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Samoa from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Samoa tax of tax paid in a country outside Samoa (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), New Zealand tax paid under the laws of New Zealand and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of Samoa from sources in New Zealand shall be allowed as a credit against Samoa tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, Samoa tax paid shall include an amount equivalent to the amount of any Samoa tax forgone. 4. In paragraph 3, the term "Samoa tax forgone" means an amount which, under the law of Samoa relating to Samoa tax and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Samoa tax on income but for an exemption from, or a reduction of, Samoa tax on that income resulting from the operation of those provisions of the laws of Samoa which the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa agree from time to time in letters exchanged for this purpose to be provisions to which this paragraph applies; and subject to its terms, such an agreement on applicable provisions shall be valid for as long as those provisions are not modified after the date of that agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character. 5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply only in relation to those years of income that may be agreed by the Government of Samoa and the Government of New Zealand in letters exchanged for this purpose. 6. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, a New Zealand resident deriving income from Samoa, being income referred to in those paragraphs, shall not be deemed to have paid Samoa tax in respect of such income where: (a)� the New Zealand resident is a financial institution or is associated with a financial institution; (b)� the competent authority of New Zealand considers, after consultation with the competent authority of Samoa, that it is inappropriate to do so having regard to: (i)� whether any prearrangements have been entered into by any person for the purpose of taking advantage of paragraph 3 for the benefit of that person or any other person; (ii)� whether any benefit accrues or may accrue to a person who is neither a New Zealand resident nor a Samoa resident; (iii)� the prevention of fraud or the avoidance of the taxes to which this Agreement applies; (iv)� any other matter which either competent authority considers relevant in the particular circumstances of the case, including any submissions from the New Zealand resident concerned. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall only apply for a period of 10 years commencing on the date in which the Agreement enters into force. CHAPTER V SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 23 Mutual Agreement Procedure 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Article 24 Exchange of Information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. Article 25 Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 26 Entry into Force 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (b) In Samoa: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of any other Samoa tax, in relation to income of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January next following that in which the Agreement enters into force. 2. The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa for the Allocation of Taxing Rights with respect to Certain Income of Individuals and to Establish a Mutual Agreement Procedure in respect of Transfer Pricing Adjustments signed at Apia on 24 August 2010 shall terminate and cease to have effect from the date upon which this Agreement has effect in respect of the taxes to which this Agreement applies in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article. 3. The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa on the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes signed at Apia on 24 August 2010 shall terminate and cease to have effect from the date upon which Article 24 of this Agreement has effect in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article. Notwithstanding the termination of the Tax Information Exchange Agreement, the Contracting States shall remain bound by the provisions of Article 8 of that Agreement with respect to any information obtained under that Agreement. Article 27 Termination This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (b) in Samoa: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of any other Samoa tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given.  IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, duly authorised by their respective Governments, have signed this Agreement.

The Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa,

Desiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their cooperation in tax matters,

Intending to conclude an Agreement for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Agreement for the indirect benefit of residents of third States)

Have agreed as follows:

**CHAPTER I**

**SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT**

**Article 1**

This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

**Article 2**

**Taxes Covered**

1\. The taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are:

(a) In New Zealand:

the income tax (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”);

(b) In Samoa:

the income tax (hereinafter referred to as “Samoa tax”).

2\. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the taxes listed in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws.

3\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State.

**CHAPTER II**

**DEFINITIONS**

**Article 3**

**General Definitions**

1\. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires:

(a) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons;

(b) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes;

(c) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business;

(d) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State;

(e) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State;

(f) the term “competent authority” means:

(i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; and

(ii) in the case of Samoa, the CEO of the Ministry for Revenue or an authorised representative;

(g) the term “national”, in relation to a Contracting State, means:

(i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and

(ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State;

(h) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character;

(i) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean New Zealand or Samoa as the context requires; and

(j) (i) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; and

2\. For the purposes of Articles 10, 11 and 12, dividends, interest or royalties arising in a Contracting State and derived by or through a trust shall be deemed to be beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State where:

(a) such income is subject to tax in that other State in the hands of the trustee of that trust;

(b) with reference to dividends, the income would be subject to tax in the hands of the trustee of that trust but for an exemption that applies to those dividends under the laws of that other State.

3\. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State.

**Article 4**

**Resident**

1\. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of their domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State.

2\. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then their status shall be determined as follows:

(a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual’s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);

(b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode;

(c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national;

(d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement.

3\. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States.

**Article 5**

**Permanent Establishment**

1\. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on.

2\. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially:

(a) a place of management;

(b) a branch;

(c) an office;

(d) a factory;

(e) a workshop, and

(f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources.

3\. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months.

4\. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if for more than 183 days in any twelve month period:

(a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or

(b) it operates substantial equipment in that State.

5\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State:

(a) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and where the services performed in that other State through that individual are professional services or other activities of an independent nature, or

(b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State

the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make the fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual.

6\. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with and are identical or substantially similar to the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons.

7\. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include:

(a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise;

(b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery;

(c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise;

(d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise;

(e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character;

(f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character.

8\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and:

(a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or

(b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise,

that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph.

9\. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business.

10\. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other.

**CHAPTER III**

**TAXATION OF INCOME**

**Article 6**

**Income from Immovable Property**

1\. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2\. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property.

3\. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property.

4\. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise.

5\. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place.

**Article 7**

**Business Profits**

1\. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment, or sales in that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State.

2\. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.

3\. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere.

4\. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

5\. Where:

(a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and

(b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State,

then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident’s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.

6\. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.

7\. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance.

**Article 8**

**Ship and Air Transport**

1\. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State.

2\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State.

3\. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.

**Article 9**

**Associated Enterprises**

1\. Where

(a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or

(b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,

and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.

2\. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

**Article 10**

**Dividends**

1\. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2\. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:

(a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and

(b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.

3\. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares and other income treated as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.

4\. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5\. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.

**Article 11**

**Interest**

1\. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2\. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest.

3\. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10.

4\. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5\. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6\. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

**Article 12**

**Royalties**

1\. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2\. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3\. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for:

(a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right;

(b) the use of, or the right to use:

(i) motion picture films,

(ii) films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio, internet or other broadcasting;

(c) the use of, or the right to use any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment;

(d) knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience;

(e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or (b), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (c) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (d);

(f) any forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph.

4\. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5\. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6\. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

**Article 13**

**Alienation of Property**

1\. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2\. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State.

3\. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State.

4\. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

5\. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply.

**Article 14**

**Income from Employment**

1\. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State.

2\. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if:

(a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the income year concerned, and

(b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and

(c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State.

1\. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State.

2\. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.

1\. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State.

(i) is a national of that State; or

(ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services.

2\. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 or 16 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Government referred to in paragraph 1.

**Article 19**

**Students**

Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State.

**Article 20**

1\. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State.

2\. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

**CHAPTER IV**

**ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION**

**Article 22**

**Elimination of Double Taxation**

1\. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Samoa tax paid under the laws of Samoa and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Samoa (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income.

2\. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Samoa from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Samoa tax of tax paid in a country outside Samoa (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), New Zealand tax paid under the laws of New Zealand and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of Samoa from sources in New Zealand shall be allowed as a credit against Samoa tax payable in respect of that income.

3\. For the purpose of paragraph 1, Samoa tax paid shall include an amount equivalent to the amount of any Samoa tax forgone.

4\. In paragraph 3, the term "Samoa tax forgone" means an amount which, under the law of Samoa relating to Samoa tax and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Samoa tax on income but for an exemption from, or a reduction of, Samoa tax on that income resulting from the operation of those provisions of the laws of Samoa which the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa agree from time to time in letters exchanged for this purpose to be provisions to which this paragraph applies; and subject to its terms, such an agreement on applicable provisions shall be valid for as long as those provisions are not modified after the date of that agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character.

5\. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply only in relation to those years of income that may be agreed by the Government of Samoa and the Government of New Zealand in letters exchanged for this purpose.

6\. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, a New Zealand resident deriving income from Samoa, being income referred to in those paragraphs, shall not be deemed to have paid Samoa tax in respect of such income where:

(a)  the New Zealand resident is a financial institution or is associated with a financial institution;

(b)  the competent authority of New Zealand considers, after consultation with the competent authority of Samoa, that it is inappropriate to do so having regard to:

(i)  whether any prearrangements have been entered into by any person for the purpose of taking advantage of paragraph 3 for the benefit of that person or any other person;

(ii)  whether any benefit accrues or may accrue to a person who is neither a New Zealand resident nor a Samoa resident;

(iii)  the prevention of fraud or the avoidance of the taxes to which this Agreement applies;

(iv)  any other matter which either competent authority considers relevant in the particular circumstances of the case, including any submissions from the New Zealand resident concerned.

7\. The provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall only apply for a period of 10 years commencing on the date in which the Agreement enters into force.

**CHAPTER V**

**SPECIAL PROVISIONS**

**Article 23**

**Mutual Agreement Procedure**

1\. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

2\. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.

3\. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement.

4\. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.

**Article 24**

**Exchange of Information**

1\. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.

2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.

3\. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:

(a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;

(b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;

(c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).

4\. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.

5\. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.

**Article 25**

**Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts**

Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements.

**CHAPTER VI**

The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the taxes listed in paragraph 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes that have been made in their taxation laws. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. 3 CHAPTER II DEFINITIONS Article 3 General Definitions 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; (b) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (c) the term “enterprise” applies to the carrying on of any business; (d) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (e) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (f) the term “competent authority” means: (i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; and (ii) in the case of Samoa, the CEO of the Ministry for Revenue or an authorised representative; (g) the term “national”, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of that Contracting State; and 4 (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in that Contracting State; (h) the term “business” includes the performance of professional services and of other activities of an independent character; (i) the terms “a Contracting State” and “the other Contracting State” mean New Zealand or Samoa as the context requires; and (j) (i) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; and (ii) the term “Samoa” means the Independent State of Samoa and its territorial waters. 2.

The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop, and (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. A building site, or a construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection with that building site or construction, installation or assembly project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 6 months. 4. An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State and to carry on business through that permanent establishment if for more than 183 days in any twelve month period: (a) it carries on activities in that State which consist of, or which are connected with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that State; or (b) it operates substantial equipment in that State. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State performs services in the other Contracting State: (a) through an individual who is present in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any 9 twelve month period, and where the services performed in that other State through that individual are professional services or other activities of an independent nature, or (b) for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period, and these services are performed for the same project or for connected projects through one or more individuals who are present and performing such services in that other State the activities carried on in that other State in performing these services shall be deemed to be carried on through a permanent establishment of the enterprise situated in that other State, unless these services are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if performed through a fixed place of business, would not make the fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, services performed by an individual on behalf of one enterprise shall not be considered to be performed by another enterprise through that individual unless that other enterprise supervises, directs or controls the manner in which these services are performed by the individual. 6. For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with and are identical or substantially similar to the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 7. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: 10 (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character; (f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in subparagraphs (a) to (e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 8. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person – other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 9 applies – is acting on behalf of an enterprise and: (a) has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise; or (b) manufactures or processes in a Contracting State for the enterprise goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 7 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 11 9. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. 10. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. 12 CHAPTER III TAXATION OF INCOME Article 6 Income from Immovable Property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting immovable property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise. 5. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. 13 Article 7 Business Profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment, or sales in that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through that permanent establishment. It is understood that the profits of an enterprise shall include profits attributable to sales of goods and merchandise referred to in this subparagraph only when the competent authority of the Contracting State in which a permanent establishment of the enterprise is situated considers that the enterprise has entered into an arrangement in relation to the sales of those goods or merchandise to avoid taxation of those profits in that Contracting State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 14 4. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 5. Where: (a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and (b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident’s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 6. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 7. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 15 Article 8 Ship and Air Transport 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 and Article 7, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. 16 Article 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first- mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. 17 Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: (a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends; and (b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares and other income treated as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in 18 respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 19 Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt- claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent 20 establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 21 Article 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: (a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark or other like property or right; (b) the use of, or the right to use: (i) motion picture films, (ii) films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio, internet or other broadcasting; (c) the use of, or the right to use any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; (d) knowledge or information concerning technical, industrial, commercial or scientific experience; (e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a) or (b), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (c) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (d); (f) any forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 22 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the profits attributable to such permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 23 Article 13 Alienation of Property 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 5. Nothing in this Agreement affects the application of the laws of a Contracting State relating to the taxation of gains of a capital nature derived from the alienation of any property other than that to which any of the preceding paragraphs of this Article apply. 24 Article 14 Income from Employment 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: (a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the income year concerned, and (b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and (c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 25 Article 15 Directors’ Fees Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 26 Article 16 Entertainers and Sportspersons 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 27 Article 17 Pensions 1. Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State. 28 Article 18 Government Service 1. (a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration (other than pensions) paid by the Government of a Contracting State to an individual in respect of services rendered to that Government shall be taxable only in that State. (b) However, such payments shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. The provisions of Articles 14, 15 or 16 shall apply to payments in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Government referred to in paragraph 1. 29 Article 19 Students Payments which a student or business apprentice who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of their education or training receives for the purpose of their maintenance, education or training shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. 30 Article 20 Other Income 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in that other State. 31 Article 21 Entitlement to Benefits Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a benefit under this Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Agreement. 32 CHAPTER IV ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Article 22 Elimination of Double Taxation 1. Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Samoa tax paid under the laws of Samoa and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Samoa (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. 2. Subject to the provisions of the laws of Samoa from time to time in force which relate to the allowance of a credit against Samoa tax of tax paid in a country outside Samoa (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), New Zealand tax paid under the laws of New Zealand and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of Samoa from sources in New Zealand shall be allowed as a credit against Samoa tax payable in respect of that income. 3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, Samoa tax paid shall include an amount equivalent to the amount of any Samoa tax forgone. 4. In paragraph 3, the term "Samoa tax forgone" means an amount which, under the law of Samoa relating to Samoa tax and in accordance with this Agreement, would have been payable as Samoa tax on income but for an exemption from, or a reduction of, Samoa tax on that income resulting from the operation of those provisions of the laws of Samoa which the Government of New Zealand and the Government of Samoa agree from time to time in letters exchanged for this purpose to be provisions to which this paragraph applies; and subject to its terms, such an agreement on applicable provisions 33 shall be valid for as long as those provisions are not modified after the date of that agreement or have been modified only in minor respects so as not to affect their general character. 5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply only in relation to those years of income that may be agreed by the Government of Samoa and the Government of New Zealand in letters exchanged for this purpose. 6. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, a New Zealand resident deriving income from Samoa, being income referred to in those paragraphs, shall not be deemed to have paid Samoa tax in respect of such income where: (a) the New Zealand resident is a financial institution or is associated with a financial institution; (b) the competent authority of New Zealand considers, after consultation with the competent authority of Samoa, that it is inappropriate to do so having regard to: (i) whether any prearrangements have been entered into by any person for the purpose of taking advantage of paragraph 3 for the benefit of that person or any other person; (ii) whether any benefit accrues or may accrue to a person who is neither a New Zealand resident nor a Samoa resident; (iii) the prevention of fraud or the avoidance of the taxes to which this Agreement applies; (iv) any other matter which either competent authority considers relevant in the particular circumstances of the case, including any submissions from the New Zealand resident concerned. 7. The provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall only apply for a period of 10 years commencing on the date in which the Agreement enters into force. 34 CHAPTER V SPECIAL PROVISIONS Article 23 Mutual Agreement Procedure 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. 35 Article 24 Exchange of Information 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: (a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; (b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; 36 (c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. 37 Article 25 Members of Diplomatic Missions and Consular Posts Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. 38 CHAPTER VI FINAL PROVISIONS Article 26 Entry into Force 1. Each of the Contracting States shall notify the other through diplomatic channels of the completion of the procedures required by its law for the bringing into force of this Agreement. The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the later of these notifications and its provisions shall have effect: (a) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non-resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (b) In Samoa: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income that is derived by a non-resident, in relation to income derived on or after the first day of the second month next following the date on which the Agreement enters into force; (ii) in respect of any other Samoa tax, in relation to income of any year of income beginning on or after 1 January next following that in which the Agreement enters into force. 2.

Notwithstanding the termination of the Tax Information Exchange Agreement, the Contracting States shall remain bound by the provisions of Article 8 of that Agreement with respect to any information obtained under that Agreement. 40 Article 27 Termination This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination at least six months before the end of any calendar year after the year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force.

Such companies comprise a significant proportion of the approximately 400,000 companies 1 in New Zealand. Many of these companies use the general company tax rules to govern their interface with their shareholders. However, there are specific tax rules available for certain types of closely held companies. 1.2 Since the early 1990s very closely held companies had been able to pass capital gains and company losses through to shareholders by electing to become a qualifying company (QC) or a loss-attributing qualifying company (LAQC). In 2010 the Government announced major changes to those specific tax rules, essentially removing LAQCs, closing off the QC rules for new entities and providing a replacement option that enabled a closely held company to be treated as if it were a partnership. Under this new approach, a company’s income and expenditure would be directly attributed to its owners in proportion to their interests, via the new look-through company (LTC) rules. 1.3 Transitional arrangements were provided to help QCs become LTCs. The government also undertook to review the dividend rules with a view to simplifying them for closely held companies more generally. 1.4 Since then, a range of concerns have been raised about the workability of the LTC rules, particularly for small businesses. This may be deterring companies from becoming LTCs as well as imposing additional compliance costs on those that become LTCs. At the end of the 2014 income year, although there were around 50,000 LTCs, there were also still nearly 70,000 QCs. While there are a range of reasons for a company continuing to be a QC, it should not be because the LTC rules are hard to comply with. 1.5 Accordingly, this issues paper reviews the LTC rules and suggests a range of changes to make the rules more workable. It also considers changes to the dividend rules applying to closely held companies that are neither LTCs nor QCs. Again this work is consistent with the Government’s objective of simplifying tax requirements and reducing compliance costs for small and medium businesses. 1.6 The focus, however, has not been purely on simplification. Consideration has also been given to the fundamental policy approach to ensure that any changes that are recommended are consistent with wider tax policy frameworks and support the integrity of the tax system. The policy approach is outlined in Chapter 2 and includes consideration of the treatment of capital gains made by closely held companies. 1 Based on companies filing tax returns. 1 1.7 Outside of liquidation, capital gains and other tax preferences 2 are clawed back when distributed by standard companies. In contrast, the LTC regime provides a vehicle for directly flowing through capital gains tax-free throughout the life of a company as LTCs are intended to be a genuine parallel to direct ownership. Extending this approach outside of LTCs raises complex issues that cannot be considered in isolation. It would therefore be premature to contemplate changes in these areas without significant further work, which could be handled through the standard tax work programme process at a future date. In the meantime, we consider it is important to proceed with the specific simplification initiatives proposed in this paper. 1.8 Some significant changes are being suggested. They include changes to the criteria that a company has to meet in order to qualify as a LTC, most notably in relation to trusts, the use of LTCs as a vehicle for conduit investment by non-residents and the requirement that the LTC have only one class of share. The changes would also narrow who would be covered by the restriction that limits an owner’s LTC losses to the amount they have at risk (the deduction limitation rule). The changes are intended to better reflect the intended closely held nature of a LTC. A summary of the suggested changes is provided below. They are discussed in detail in the following chapters. 1.9 Some key statistics are provided in Appendix 1. Summary of suggested changes LTCs Entry criteria • Changes should be made in relation to trusts: – A beneficiary that has received any distribution in the last six years should be a “counted owner”. 3 – A company should not be eligible for LTC status if a trust that is a shareholder makes a distribution to a corporate (non-LTC) beneficiary. – The trustee should continue to be a single counted owner in the event that no distributions are made in the relevant period (last six years). • Charit ies and Māori authorities would be precluded from being shareholders in LTCs or beneficiaries of trusts that own shares in LTCs. This would not impact on standard charitable donations. • More than one class of share should be allowed so as to provide for different voting rights, provided all shares still have uniform entitlements to income and deductions. • As a LTC is not intended as a conduit vehicle, its foreign income would be restricted to the greater of $10,000 or 20 percent of it s gross inco me when more than 50 percent of the LTC’s shares are held by non-residents, if it wishes to retain its LTC status. 2 Tax preferred income is income received by a company where New Zealand company tax is either lightly imposed, or not imposed at all. 3 Counted owners are the owners of the LTC. A LTC can have no more than five counted owners. 2 Deduction limitation rule • The restriction that limits an owner’s LTC deductions to the amount they have at risk should be confined to just situations when there are partnerships of LTCs. • Some technical changes should be made to the formula to clarify its application for those still covered by the rule. • Deductions that have had to be carried forward can be used as an immediate deduction against the shareholders’ other income in the 2017–18 income year. • The anti-avoidance valuation rule (in section GB 50) designed to ensure that partners’ transactions are at market value should be extended to include LTC shareholders. Existing QCs • Existing QCs should be allowed to continue but, to address concerns that they could be sold for a windfall gain, they would lose their QC status upon change of control of the company. Remission income • There should not be remission income for a shareholder when an amount owed to them by the LTC is subsequently remitted because the LTC cannot repay the loan. • There should be a legislative technical fix to ensure that the remission income rules apply as intended when a debt is remitted by a third party, to clarify the value of a loan that is impaired. Entry matters • The income adjustment done at the time of entering into the LTC regime (the untaxed reserves formula), should be changed to ensure that the income adjustment reflects shareholders’ marginal tax rates rather than the company rate of 28%. • A technical change should be made to clarify the values at which a LTC’s assets and liabilities are deemed to be held by LTC owners on the company entering the regime. 3 Initiatives to simplify and reduce the compliance and administration costs associated with closely held companies that are neither LTCs nor QCs • Liberalisation of the restrictions around tainted 4 capital gains to ensure that genuine capital gains made by small businesses do not become taxable on liquidation merely because there is a transaction involving an associated party. Tainting would not apply when the associated person is a non-corporate and we are considering whether there are other cases when it should not apply. • The deduction of RWT from fully imputed dividends between companies would be optional rather than obligatory. This would be of benefit to a wide range of companies. • Optional removal of resident withholding tax (RWT) obligations from small companies in respect of the dividends and interest they pay to their shareholders would be considered as part of the wider work on streamlining business tax processes. • Streamlining RWT obligations when cash and non-cash dividends are paid concurrently so that they can be treated as a single dividend. • Shareholder salaries could be subject to a combination of PAYE and provisional tax provided the company maintains the approach consistently from year to year. Next steps 1.10 Once the consultation period has closed, officials will report to the Government on the feedback and the Government will consider what legislative changes are appropriate. Such changes are intended to be included in the next omnibus taxation bill, with most of the changes applying from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year.

Accordingly, before discussing our suggested changes, we outline the policy framework below. Policy framework for considering company taxation 2.2 A business can be run in a variety of different ways – as a sole trader, a partnership, a trust, or a company. Likewise, the tax treatment can vary in practice depending on the entity used to conduct the business. 2.3 The tax system contains a number of flow-through entities including LTCs, ordinary partnerships and limited partnerships, as well as quasi flow-through entities, such as trusts, grand-parented QCs and portfolio investment entities (PIEs). The entities sometimes parallel commercial law and in other cases have been introduced into the tax law to achieve particular policy purposes. A comparison of the various entity treatments is provided in Table 1. 2.4 Having a variety of treatments can create economic distortions. Accordingly, it is desirable to minimise the areas of difference. 5 However, having a single tax treatment for all business entities is impractical. 6 Therefore, we see a minimum of at least two types of tax treatment: the individual and the standard company tax approaches. Individual taxation approach 2.5 Under this approach, all the net income is attributed to the underlying individuals and is taxed at their marginal tax rates. If certain forms o f income derived by the business are free of tax, the individuals receive the income tax-free. If losses are generated within the business, the losses can be used to reduce tax on the other income of the individuals, or can be carried forward by them. When the individual sells all or part of their interest in the business, it can trigger tax consequences such as claw-back of depreciation. 5 In designing the appropriate tax treatment for entities, and in particular closely held companies, some key issues are:  when to allow tax preferences generated by an entity to flow through to the owners of the entity;  if tax preferences are allowed to flow through, should there be restrictions on the ability to earn offshore income because when an ordinary company earns tax preferred offshore income this preference is clawed back on distribution; and  how to treat losses, and to ensure that only true economic losses are deductible. 6 One tax treatment for all entities would require a fully integrated company tax system whereby company profits are attributed to shareholders and taxed directly in their hands in a similar way to the profits of a partnership being taxed in the hands of the partners. Full integration was rejected as an option in the mid-1980s and we would not recommend revisiting this issue. 7 Table 1: Comparison of entity tax treatments Direct ownership General partnership Limited partnership LTC LAQC (no longer available) 7 QC Trust Company Ownership rules N/A No restrictions No upper limit on number of partners but must have at least one general partner, and one limited partner Five or fewer look- through owners (under review) Was five or fewer shareholders including associates No new QCs allowed Existing QCs must have five or fewer shareholders including associates No restrictions on settlors or beneficiaries No restrictions Different ownership rules / class of shares N/A Partnership agreement could provide for different rights for different partners Partnership agreement could provide for different rights for different partners Only one class of share allowed Multiple classes of shares allowed Multiple classes of shares allowed Trust agreement could provide for different rights for different beneficiaries Multiple classes of shares allowed Owner’s liability Unlimited Unlimited Limited Limited Limited Limited Limited for beneficiaries, unlimited for trustees Limited Tax rate Owner’s tax rate Partners’ tax rates Partners’ tax rates Shareholders’ tax rates Company tax rate on accrual, adjusted to shareholders’ tax rates on distribution Company tax rate on accrual, adjusted to shareholders’ tax rates on distribution Trustee income taxed at equivalent to top personal rate, beneficiary income taxed at beneficiaries’ tax rates Company tax rate on accrual, adjusted to shareholders’ tax rates on distribution Losses Available to owner Available to partners Available to partners subject to loss limitation rules Available to shareholders subject to loss limitation rules (under review) Available to shareholders Quarantined to company Quarantined to trust Quarantined to company Capital gains Never taxed Never taxed Never taxed Never taxed Never taxed Never taxed Never taxed Not taxed on accrual, may be taxed on distribution Ownership changes / restructures Owner taxed on revenue account gains / losses and depreciation adjustments Partners taxed on share of revenue account gains / losses and depreciation adjustments subject to de minimis rules Partners taxed on share of revenue account gains / losses and depreciation adjustments subject to de minimis rules Shareholders taxed on share of revenue account gains / losses and depreciation adjustments subject to de minimis rules Not taxed (unless shareholder holds shares on revenue account) Not taxed (unless shareholder holds shares on revenue account) Not taxed (beneficiaries’ rights could be changed by varying trust agreement) Not taxed (unless shares are held on revenue account) Shareholder continuity requirements apply – if breached, losses and imputation credits are forfeited 7 Loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) were a form of QC that enabled losses to flow through to shareholders. Most QCs (around 95 percent) were LAQCs. As Table 9 in Appendix 1 shows, around half of LAQCs have retained their QC status, around a third have become LTCs while the rest are either carrying on business in another form (for example, as an ordinary company) or have ceased business. 8 2.6 This approach applies not only to individuals but also to partnerships 8 and LTCs as they are closely controlled by individuals. In their case, the income earned and the expenditure incurred by the company are allocated to the partners and shareholders on the basis of their respective ownership. The LTC rules allow the business to still have the commercial benefits of a company, such as limited liability and the ability to contract in its own right. Conceptually, this type of integration is ideal for closely held companies as it meets one of the goals of closely held company taxation, which is to reduce the tax impediments and/or unintended benefits of migration from an unincorporated business to a business carried on in a company. That is, the tax consequences should be similar regardless of the form in which the business is run. However, a number of practical constraints limit its desirability as a tax vehicle for all small to medium sized companies. Standard company taxation approach 2.7 The second main approach is company taxation. The company is taxed on the income it earns. When company profits are distributed as dividends to shareholders, imputation credits can be attached as a credit for the tax paid at the company level, to ensure that there is no double taxation. 2.8 Under this approach, if a company earns lightly taxed or tax-free income, this tax preference is clawed back when dividends are paid because there are no corresponding imputation credits. Two key examples of preferences that are clawed back are controlled foreign company (CFC) dividends which are exempt at the company level, and capital gains made by the company. Under standard company tax treatment, capital gains can only be distributed tax-free to shareholders on the liquidation of the company. This aspect is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 2.9 Also under standard company taxation, losses of a company must be carried forward to be offset against future company income and cannot be used by the shareholders to offset against their other income. When a shareholder sells their shares in the business or new owners are introduced, in many cases it does not trigger tax consequences. 2.10 Examples comparing the individual and company approaches are provided below in Table 2. 8 For tax purposes a partnership includes not only relationships covered by the Partnership Act 1908 but also certain joint ventures and the co-ownership of property. 9 Table 2: Examples comparing individual and company treatment Individual treatment Standard company treatment (simplified to ignore RWT) Taxable income An individual earns $100 of taxable income. This is taxed at their marginal tax rate (33% in this case), which means that the tax is $33. The individual is the sole shareholder in company A. Company A earns $100. This is taxed at the company tax rate of 28%, making the tax $28. The company distributes the balance of $72 as a dividend, with $28 in imputation credits attached, making a gross dividend of $100. The shareholder includes the $100 dividend in their taxable income and a further $5 of tax is payable after allowing for the $28 imputation credits. Overall, there is no double taxation and the tax is based on the individual’s tax rate. Note that if the shareholder is on a marginal tax rate of 17.5%, the tax liability on the $100 dividend is $17.50, so that the balance of the imputation credits ($28 - $17.50) can be used towards meeting the tax on other income. Capital gain An individual earns $100 in capital gains (say on the sale of land). This does not form part of the individual’s income and no tax is payable. If a company earns a capital gain of $100, there is no company tax. If it distributes the $100 as a dividend there would be no imputation credits to attach. The individual shareholder includes the $100 dividend in their taxable income and has $33 tax to pay. This means that under the company treatment, capital gains made at the company level are clawed back on distribution to shareholders (except where the company liquidates). Losses An individual makes a tax loss of $100 on an income earning asset (say a rental property). This loss can be offset against the individual’s other income, or carried forward to offset against future income. A company makes a tax loss of $100. This loss can be offset against the company’s other income (if any) or can be carried forward to offset against future company income. The loss cannot be distributed to shareholders, but it can be offset to other group companies. 10 Mixture of the two approaches 2.11 As Table 1 illustrates, for some types of entity the income tax treatment is a mixture of the above two approaches. For example, under the QC rules profits are taxed at the standard company tax rate with any subsequent distribution of those profits being taxable at the respective shareholders’ tax rates (with imputation credits attached), but with capital gains and any other untaxed amounts being able to be passed through to shareholders tax-free. Previously, LAQC losses could also be passed through to shareholders to offset against any other income they earned. 2.12 When the company and top personal tax rates were aligned, this mixed approach was generally appropriate. However, once the top personal rate became higher than the company rate there was concern that the QC/LAQC regime went beyond the objective of removing the tax disadvantage from incorporation, 9 and in fact provided a tax advantage. 10 2.13 The treatment of trusts is also a hybrid, with the income earned being either taxed as trustee income at equivalent to the top personal rate or, if distributed, taxed at the personal tax rates of the beneficiaries. Losses are quarantined within the trust, to be used against future trustee income. Boundary between the approaches 2.14 Having two different tax treatments will always create some distortions. It raises the question about where the line should best be drawn between them. There is no perfect solution to this question so a degree of pragmatism is required, while trying to minimise likely distortions. Since LTCs (and QCs) sit on this boundary (a LTC being legally a company but with individual flow-through tax treatment) it is important to know the target audience for the LTC rules as this influences the criteria that are applied to LTCs. 2.15 Individual treatment should be applied to company situations when the investment could have genuinely been owned directly by the individual or family trust shareholder(s) but they wish to have the protection of limited liability. This prevents tax being a distorting factor in what would otherwise be a commercial decision to incorporate. 2.16 Allowing the pass-through of losses also raises the possibility of loss trading. 11 As a matter of policy the eligibility criteria are an important way of reducing the possibility of such trading. Focusing on the number of shareholders seems a useful method of reducing this risk. It is also consistent with the approach that LTCs are only intended for investors who have a realistic option of operating as individuals or through a company. 9 This was compared with the treatment as a sole trader or partnership. 10 The non-alignment of the company tax rate and top personal rate provided a potential incentive to defer distributing a QC’s taxable income to shareholders on personal rates above the company rate, whereas losses could be automatically passed through to those shareholders to be offset against their other income. 11 Loss trading occurs when an arrangement is made whereby taxpayer(s) who do not hold an economic interest in an entity, such as a LTC, that has made a tax loss are able to deduct the loss against their other income. The arrangement is invariably tax driven rather than related to any wider commercial return. The government loses revenue as a result of the sheltering of the income of the unrelated taxpayer(s). 11 2.17 A subsequent question is whether this individual treatment approach should apply to companies operating cross-border. In terms of outbound investment, there is a policy case for applying corporate treatment to most, if not all, overseas businesses owned either directly (branches) or indirectly (CFCs) by New Zealand companies, in order to better align the treatment of cross-border investments in different forms. This raises the issue of whether it is consistent to allow outbound investment to receive look-through tax treatment. On the other hand, there is the general point that LTC taxation is intended to be similar to the taxation of direct investment by shareholders. 12 2.18 There is also the general issue with conduit investment and, consequently, the related risks to the tax base and base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) concerns. These international aspects are discussed in Chapter 4. Target audience for the LTC rules 2.19 What does this boundary imply for the target audience for the LTC rules? Our conclusion is that the LTC target audience is any investment that can be done by an individual or small group of individuals. This means the focus is on tight control of the entity by individuals rather than on the size of the entity, even though in practice small unsophisticated businesses are likely to make up the majority of LTCs. As Chart 1 illustrates later in Chapter 5, the majority of LTCs fall into the -$20,000 to +$10,000 annual income range and 90 percent are within the -$50,000 to +$50,000 annual income range. Treatment of capital gains 2.20 We have concentrated our review primarily on streamlining the rules for LTCs. However, a number of issues with the current wider policy settings have been raised by stakeholders, including the extent to which closely held companies should be able to distribute capital gains tax-free. 2.21 There is a case for allowing capital gains to flow through tax-free in certain circumstances when there is a genuine parallel to direct ownership. This is because those gains would be tax-free if earned directly (or through a partnership) by the owner. Similar considerations were behind the Valabh Committee recommending the QC regime in the early 1990s. 13 Like QCs, the LTC regime provides a vehicle for capital gains to be distributed tax-free throughout the life of a company, not just on liquidation. 2.22 Issues such as whether to allow closely held companies outside of LTCs and existing QCs to distribute capital gains tax-free during the course of business are complex and cannot be considered in isolation. It would be premature to contemplate changes in these areas without significant further work, which 12 Although typically individuals do not carry on overseas business through branches and do not very often carry out business through directly owned CFCs. 13 The Valabh Committee favoured the qualifying company approach over directly attributing the income and expenditure of closely held companies to individual shareholders because they considered that it would be simpler and cover a potentially wider group given that some companies would have more than one class of share. 12 could be handled through the standard tax policy work programme process at a future date. 2.23 To illustrate their complexity, we note that the issue of the tax status of capital gain distributions is intricately tied up with the tax treatment of dividends. Dividends can be classified as distributions from revenue reserves and distributions from capital sources. If only certain types of dividend were exempt, such as those paid out of capital profits, there would be pressure to convert company income into the preferred form. Refraining from permitting the pass-through of tax preferences therefore helps to ensure the robustness of the company tax base. 14 Similar considerations apply to limit a company’s ability to return capital to ensure that what is in effect a dividend from retained earnings is not “dressed up” as a return of capital. 2.24 The tax treatment of capital gains on liquidation provides a further complication. In practice, businesses can distribute capital gains tax-free through forming multiple companies to hold specific assets and liquidating those companies as the capital gains on the assets are realised. In doing so, however, they incur additional compliance costs. We acknowledge the compliance cost concerns but arguably the ability to get out capital gains tax- free on liquidation is a distortion, at least for those companies for whom company tax-treatment is appropriate. 14 The taxation of capital gains was suggested even on liquidation in the Government Consultative Document on Full Imputation (December 1987) but was recommended against by the subsequent Consultative Committee (see Full Imputation – Report of the Consultative Committee (April 1988)). 13 14 CHAPTER 3 LTC entry criteria Introduction 3.1 A set of entry criteria apply to limit the type of entity that can be a LTC and to limit the type and number of owners. Given that flow-through treatment includes the flow-through of losses, the entry criteria also help to limit the opportunity for those losses to be traded or otherwise utilised by those not incurring the economic loss. 3.2 A key consideration of the review has been whether these entry criteria sufficiently match the intent of the LTC regime as designed for closely controlled companies. Current entry criteria 3.3 We have reviewed the entry criteria against the “target audience” for the LTC regime, namely, investments that could otherwise be made by an individual or small group of individuals, including through a family trust. Other tax-transparent options are available for more widely held investments and, given their different target audience, we do not see the availability of such options as a reason for widening the eligibility criteria for LTCs. 3.4 For example, given that more widely held vehicles such as limited partnerships open up the possibility for loss retailing, 15 it is appropriate that the tax legislation applies a deduction limitation rule in their case to limit the pass through of deductions to the amounts that owners have at risk. In contrast, this issues paper is recommending (see the next chapter for more detail) that the pass-through of deductions be retained for LTCs and that a deduction limitation rule should not be applied to most LTCs. In these circumstances, it is even more important that widely held investments cannot access LTC treatment. 3.5 Table 3 summarises the current entry criteria for LTCs and QCs. The QC rules are used only as a point of comparison. We are not proposing changing the current eligibility rules for QCs, which is consistent with the grandparenting of those entities. 3.6 In comparison, as noted in Table 1, the tax rules for a partnership contain no comparable entry criteria, and a limited partnership’s main entry restrictions are that it has to have at least one general partner and a limited partner. General partners manage the business and are liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership, whereas limited partners are usually passive investors and are only liable to the extent of their capital contribution. This distinction is akin to directors and shareholders in a company. 15 Loss retailing is a form of loss trading. It occurs when schemes are marketed to portfolio investors which produce significant upfront tax deductions to be applied against the investors’ other income. Those losses typically exceed the amounts at risk. 15 Table 3: Entry criteria LTC QC Company requirements/restrictions:  Has to be “company”  Cannot be flat-owning company  Is tax resident in NZ, including under double tax agreements  One class of share  No restrictions on earning foreign income Shareholder requirements:  Maximum of five look-through counted owners  Shareholders must be natural persons, trustees (natural persons or corporate) or another LTC  Can be non-resident  Natural persons linked to two degrees counted as one  Generally look behind trustees to beneficiaries (provided they have received distributions of beneficiary income in the last three income years – where all the income has not been distributed, the trustees are counted as owners)  Look behind LTC shareholders to the ultimate owners Company requirements/restrictions:  Has to be a “company”  Is tax resident in NZ, including under double tax agreements  Cannot earn more than $10,000 p.a. of non- dividend foreign income  Cannot be part of an arrangement, the purpose of which is to defeat intent and application of rules (section GB 6) Shareholder requirements:  Maximum of five look-through shareholders  Shareholders must be natural persons, trustees (natural persons or corporate) or another QC  Can be non-resident  Natural persons linked to one degree counted as one  Look behind trustees to beneficiaries (counting all beneficiaries who have received dividends from the QC through the trust as beneficiary income since the 1991–92 income year)  Look behind QCs to their ultimate owners Review of company requirements “Company” and tax resident status requirements 3.7 The LTC rules are designed to allow flow-through tax treatment to businesses that have a genuine reason for choosing limited liability corporate structures as an alternative to undertaking their activities as sole traders or as small partnerships. The requirement that the business be a “company” is, therefore, an integral part of the rules. 3.8 Likewise, given that effective look-through treatment is targeted at closely controlled New Zealand businesses, the requirement that the company be New Zealand tax resident is also appropriate. One class of share 3.9 Currently a LTC can only have one class of share. This restriction is an important part of look-through treatment as it makes for ease of calculating relative shareholdings, which provides the basis for allocating a LTC’s income and losses. Shareholding is likely to represent a person’s contribution to a family business or a conscious decision on the part of those with interests in a company to divide the profits of a business in particular proportions. Investors in a LTC can achieve different risk profiles through the use of debt and equity, as appropriate. 16 3.10 We acknowledge that there can be legitimate commercial/generational planning reasons for shares to carry different voting rights and that the current restriction may inhibit some companies from becoming LTCs. A parent, for example, because of their industry expertise, may want to retain control of the decision-making process when children are introduced into the business. 3.11 In these circumstances, we consider that the “one class of share” requirement may be unnecessarily rigid. However, we remain concerned about types of shares that could produce income or deduction streaming opportunities. 3.12 As a result, we are recommending that different classes of shares carrying different voting rights be allowed, provided all other rights are the same. In particular, the shares must carry the same rights to income and losses, including on liquidation. Foreign income and non-resident ownership 3.13 These aspects are discussed separately in Chapter 4. Review of shareholder requirements Maximum of five look-through counted owners 3.14 The purpose of the requirement that a LTC must have five or fewer “look- through counted owners” is to ensure that the company should be “closely controlled” by individuals. This is consistent with the idea that LTCs are a substitute for direct investment. Under the current rules: • owners that are “relatives” are counted together; • LTCs that own shares in other LTCs are effectively ignored, with the owners of the parent LTC being instead counted for the purposes of the five-person test; • ordinary companies cannot directly hold shares in a LTC, but can indirectly have an interest in a LTC through receiving beneficiary income from a trust that owns shares in a LTC (a shareholding trust). In the latter case, the ordinary company’s shareholders (and those that hold market value interests) are counted as look-through owners when they have received beneficiary income in either the current year or one of the last three years; • similarly, natural person beneficiaries of a shareholding trust are only counted if they have received beneficiary income in the current year or one of the last three years; and • a trustee of a shareholding trust is treated as a counted owner if it has not distributed, as beneficiary income, all income attributed from the LTC interest in the current and last three years. 17 Relatives 3.15 To be a “relative”, a person must meet the general “associated persons” test in the tax legislation. Generally speaking, two people are related if they are: • within the second degree of blood relationship with each other; • in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with each other; • in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship with a person within the second degree of blood relationship; • an adopted child of a person and persons within the first degree of relationship of that person; • a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefitted or is eligible to benefit. 3.16 The LTC rules also provide that dissolution of marriage, civil unions or relationships are to be ignored. 3.17 This current test can mean that significant family groups are counted together as a single LTC owner. In the following example 16 (where there is a maximum of two children per couple), if all the people mentioned owned shares in the same LTC they would be counted as one person: 3.18 The current rules, therefore, contemplate situations when up to conceivably five mult i-generational families could all be shareholders in a company and that company would still be eligible for LTC status. By contrast, the QC rules, which only allow one degree of relationship, are in theory more restrictive. In practice, however, there is no evidence that this difference is leading to significantly wider overall shareholdings. Most LTCs have only one or two shareholders/owners. 17 The current test also has the benefit of being well understood given it is based on the definition of “associated person”. 16 See Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 23, No. 1, February 2011. 17 Of the 46,025 LTCs that filed an IR7L for 2013, 30 percent reported having just one ‘owner’ while 92.5 percent reported having either one or two ‘owners’. This seems to be largely in line with data on closely held companies more generally. A 2006 study on closely held companies indicated that of the 431,000 companies registered at the Companies Office, nearly 95 percent had five or fewer shareholders, with 140,000 having only one shareholder (33 percent of all companies) 186,000 having two shareholders (43 percent) and 80,000 having three to five shareholders (18 percent).

John m Olivia Zeb m Esther Benjamin Mary m Jones (stepfather of Curtis) Curtis 18 3.19 Consequently, we are not proposing any changes in this area. Individuals would, therefore, continue to be treated as they are now, in other words a two degree of relationship test would continue to apply. Companies 3.20 At present the only corporate that is permitted to have a direct shareholding in a LTC is another LTC (other than corporate trustees, which are discussed below). We are not recommending any changes in this area. The prohibition on ordinary companies owning LTC shares appears consistent with the idea that LTCs should not be widely held or used as a way to shelter company income from tax, 18 and should be retained. Trusts 3.21 Our starting proposition in looking at trustees as shareholders of LTCs is that the entry criteria tests would have failed if the interposing of a shareholding trust allows for more owners than would have been allowed if those people had held shares directly. In saying this, it is more challenging to determine who has “benefitted” from a LTC in a trust situation. We accept it is difficult to argue that all beneficiaries will always benefit from the fact that trustees own a LTC. 3.22 Nevertheless, we are proposing changes to how trusts are measured as “look- through counted owners” because the current rules seem to be too generous in two key respects. 3.23 The first issue is in relation to the measurement period. The current test that casts back just three preceding years when considering whether a beneficiary of a trust should be counted as a look-through counted owner potentially provides scope for beneficiaries to be ‘rotated’. The rotation of beneficiaries enables the profits of the company to be distributed to a larger beneficiary class while still meeting the requirement of a maximum of five look-through counted owners. 3.24 The second issue is the focus just on distributions of beneficiary income fro m LTC interests. The focus on beneficiary income is a proxy for receiving a benefit. However, there are instances when a person does not receive beneficiary income, but nevertheless benefits from a trust owning LTC shares. A person might, for example, receive a distribution of trustee income. It is not difficult to envisage situations when multiple beneficiaries could receive distributions of trustee income such that the numbers could be skewed. 18 For example, by taking a shareholding in a LTC, a LTC loss could be passed through to the company and used to shelter company income from tax, without the company incurring the underlying economic loss. 19 Example Distributions of income from a LTC interest are made by Family Trust to 10 beneficiaries. The trustee is deciding on whether the trust’s current year income should be made as trustee income or beneficiary income. Depending on the decision, the outcome in terms of the number of look-through counted owners can vary from 1 to 11. 3.25 Furthermore, the focus on income derived just from a LTC interest may cause practical difficulties given the fungibility of money and the potential for streaming distributions to selected beneficiaries. 3.26 We note that a more restrictive test applies to QCs – in their case a trustee must distribute all dividends from the QC as beneficiary income (other than non-cash dividends). Furthermore, all beneficiaries that have derived beneficiary income from dividends since the 1991–92 income year, when QCs were introduced, are treated as counted shareholders. This reference back to 1991–92 has proved to be a compliance problem in some instances, as time has elapsed. The proposal 3.27 We are not suggesting adopting the QC approach but rather to count all distributions made, whether beneficiary or trustee income, corpus or capital. In terms of the time period, a LTC test that tied in with other more general record-keeping period requirements would appear to be justifiable. The proposal is that a beneficiary that has received any distribution from the shareholding trust in the last six years would be a counted owner. 3.28 This six year measurement period acknowledges that any extended period would need to be enforceable in practice and that imposing stricter than usual record-keeping requirements on trustees of relatively unsophisticated trusts would be difficult to justify. Rather than tying the LTC requirement to the record-keeping period required for tax purposes, it seems more appropriate to match the time period with that generally applying to claims under the Limitations Act 2010 as trustees are required to keep records for at least that time in case a beneficiary challenges a distribution decision. 19 3.29 Some entities are likely to lose their LTC status as a result of this proposal. This is an appropriate outcome as it ensures that the LTC ownership rules in relat ion to trusts do not allow more look-through owners than would be the case under direct ownership. When there are no distributions 3.30 Currently, in the event that not all income from an interest in a LTC is distributed as beneficiary income, the trustee is a single counted owner. The only viable alternative to counting trustees in these circumstances would be to count settlors, on the assumption that they are the ones ultimately 19 The purpose of the Limitations Act is to promote greater certainty by preventing claims being brought against a person or business after a period of time (generally six years), but at the same time the business has to keep records for that period so that the relevant information is available should a claim be brought within that time period. 20 benefitting from the existence of the trust. However, a settlor test would likely be complicated, 20 and not a test that domestic trusts would be likely to have to apply commonly in their day-to-day management of their tax affairs. Consequently, our conclusion is that a trustee should continue to be a separate counted owner in the event that not all income is distributed for the relevant period. As with the proposed revised test for measuring the number of beneficiaries, the test for determining whether a trustee is a counted owner should be modified to focus on all income sources rather than just income from interests in LTCs. Corporate beneficiaries 3.31 Corporate beneficiaries are currently permitted. This means that although the structure below on the left is prohibited, the one on the right is permissible. The effect of the two structures appears, however, to be identical: 3.32 It should, however, be noted that if the trust makes a distribution of beneficiary income from LTC interests to the corporate, the corporate is looked through when determining the number of owners. If it is widely held, then LTC status would be revoked. 3.33 In keeping with the exclusion of corporate shareholders, a company should not, in principle, be eligible for LTC status if a trustee shareholder has a corporate (non-LTC) beneficiary. Given, however, that a number of LTCs may already have corporate beneficiaries, we are proposing that the requirement focus on distributions to corporate beneficiaries. The proposal is that LTC status would cease from the beginning of the income year in which a distribution is made to a corporate beneficiary, irrespective of the number of natural person shareholders that it may have. 20 For example, there may not be robust records around all situations when a person might have become a deemed settlor for tax purposes. Company A Trust B Sole beneficiary and recipient of beneficiary income 100% holding 100 % holding LTC Ltd Company A LTC Ltd 21 Example XYZ Trust owns shares in ABC Limited (a LTC) and makes a distribution of 2016–17 year income to Corporate Limited (a beneficiary of the trust that is not a LTC) in the 2017–18 income year. LTC status would cease from the beginning of the 2017–18 income year. 3.34 In the above example, LTC status is lost in the year of the distribution. Ideally, if the distribution is from beneficiary income, then LTC status should be lost in the year that the beneficiary income is earned, which in the above example would be the 2016–17 income year. Because this would involve additional compliance costs in adjusting past tax payments and returns, we prefer to treat all distributions the same and to base the loss of status on the year of the distribution. Other shareholders/beneficiaries 3.35 The above approach of looking through to the ultimate beneficiaries should extend to charities and Māori authorities given they are likely to have a wide set of beneficiaries. Charities 3.36 Although not all charities are trusts, they nevertheless have to be carrying out a charitable purpose. 21 Most also have to meet a public benefit test, which implies that they need to have far more than five beneficiaries. In these circumstances, rather than focusing on whether the charity is a trust, whether and when distributions have been made and whether there are more than five beneficiaries, it seems simpler, from a compliance perspective, to treat all charities the same. The proposal is to exclude charities from being either shareholders in a LTC or beneficiaries of a shareholding trust. This would not preclude charities from operating through other business structures. 3.37 LTCs or shareholding trusts may wish to alternatively make charitable donations. Generally, we do not consider that such charitable donations made in the normal course of business would be a problem. The only concern would be when regular donations were used as a proxy for LTC ownership. Given that we do not want to discourage genuine charitable donations, we consider that there may be merit in having an explicit safe- harbour rule to provide greater certainty. The rule would in effect allow a shareholding trust to donate up to 10 percent of the net income it receives fro m its look-through interest in any given year to charitable entities without bringing into question the status of the LTC. 21 The definition of “charitable purpose” in the Income Tax Act reflects general charities law, which is that the purpose has to be one of the following: the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. These purposes are commonly referred to as the four “heads” of charity. Except in the case of the relief of poverty, the public benefit test must also be satisfied. That test is that those benefiting must be the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. 22 Māori authorities 3.38 Māori authorities similarly have a wide number of beneficiaries and, therefore, should also automatically be precluded from being shareholders in a LTC, either directly or indirectly. An implication would be that a Māori authority’s separate corporate business activity would be taxed at the standard company rate of 28%, as intended, rather than at the Māori authority rate of 17.5%. 3.39 Our understanding is that these proposed restrictions would not have a significant impact on either charities or Māori authorities, but feedback on this point is invited. 23 24 CHAPTER 4 International aspects – foreign income and non-resident ownership Introduction 4.1 Currently there is no restriction on foreign investments by LTCs or on a LTC having non-resident shareholders. A LTC can earn foreign income and, unlike a QC, is not restricted to earning a maximum of $10,000 non-dividend foreign inco me. 4.2 This open approach raises several policy issues: • it allows LTCs to be used to avoid the features of the imputation system that apply to foreign income and allows branch losses to be applied against individual income; and • it provides a relat ively low-cost conduit structure for non-residents to utilise. 4.3 The issue of whether LTCs should be used as a vehicle for cross-border investment has not been closely examined from a policy perspective before. A key aspect to consider is whether the rules for LTCs in respect of cross- border investment are consistent with the general policies underpinning New Zealand’s international tax rules more generally. There are also some concerns that LTCs could be used as part of a conduit arrangement. Policy considerations 4.4 There are three scenarios in the international context: • A non-resident investing in New Zealand assets through a LTC. • A New Zealand resident investing offshore through a LTC. • A LTC owned by a non-resident with only foreign assets (the conduit case). A non-resident investing in New Zealand assets through a LTC 4.5 In respect of the first scenario, flow-through treatment means that the non- resident owner of the LTC will be taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Source taxation may also be reduced or eliminated under New Zealand’s double tax agreements. 4.6 In this context hybrid entity mismatches where an entity is treated as flow- through in one country but not in another, which could be the case wit h LTCs, 22 are under scrutiny by the OECD as part of its work on base erosion 22 For example, a LTC is a look-through vehicle in New Zealand but is treated as a company for tax purposes in Australia. 25 and profit shifting (BEPS). The OECD is developing recommendations for domestic rules intended to neutralise the tax effect of hybrid mismatches and New Zealand is looking at the suitability of implementing these recommendations. A New Zealand resident investing offshore through a LTC 4.7 As discussed earlier, LTCs are designed for investments that would be made by an individual or small group of individuals, including through a family trust, but for the fact that the investors decide on a limited liability structure. This prevents tax being a distorting factor in what would otherwise be a commercial decision to incorporate. This distortion is less obvious when it comes to some forms of outbound investment. In many situations, making a significant outbound active investment, which typically is of a more significant scale, without the protection of a limited liability structure for the offshore investment would not be commercially realistic. 4.8 The QC regime requires that a company cannot earn more than $10,000 a year of non-dividend foreign income. The reason for this requirement was largely because of the concern that some foreign income earned at the QC level could be distributed to shareholders tax-free, as unimputed dividends paid by QCs are tax exempt. At the time the LTC rules were being developed, a similar restriction was considered not to be necessary because the look-through mechanism would ensure that foreign income would be taxed at the appropriate marginal tax rate when attributed to shareholders. However, the availability of foreign tax credits to offset some or all of the New Zealand tax owing adds a further overlay. 4.9 New Zealand’s imputation system means that preferences earned by companies, such as foreign tax credits, are not passed through to shareholders. 23 This has been a cornerstone of New Zealand tax policy since the late 1980s. 24 Arguably, allowing LTCs to earn significant income offshore is not consistent with this policy given that any foreign tax credits flow through to LTC shareholders. On the other hand, the counter argument is that those credits would be available if the individual shareholders invested directly. 4.10 LTCs also allow foreign branch losses to be applied against individual income, which creates a coherence risk. This is because the branch may be converted to a foreign company when it becomes profitable and, therefore, the foreign branch loss is never recaptured by future foreign income – instead it is available to offset domestic income. This possibility can arise wit h company offshore investment generally, although in the case of a LTC there may be an additional risk from being able to flow losses back to shareholders where they can be offset against the shareholder’s non-business income. 4.11 Foreign personal services income, on the other hand, may not raise the same concerns. Also, the concerns around direct outbound investment via LTCs 23 The theory is that this helps to incentivise investors to make foreign investments only when it is in the interests of New Zealand as a whole. 24 This policy position was confirmed during the International Tax Review, and also when New Zealand’s position on mutual recognition of imputation credits was reviewed. 26 may not be an issue in practice as only a very small proportion of LTCs (around 0.5 percent) earn foreign income and the vast bulk of those that do, earn less than $10,000 of foreign income (see Tables 11 and 12 in Appendix 1 for more detail). Table 4: Foreign income/losses and foreign tax credits earned by LTCs Number of LTCs with foreign income Total foreign income Total FTCs Number of LTCs with foreign losses Total foreign losses 2012 184 $217.1m $7.2m 14 -$0.2m 2013 239 $29.8m $6.7m 21 -$1.4m 2014\* 273 $36.2m $6.0m 24 -$3.9m \*almost a complete year Conduit investments 4.12 LTCs were designed as a domestically focussed vehicle, not as a vehicle for conduit investment. There are reputational risks with allowing conduit structures and there is some anecdotal evidence that LTCs have been used to facilitate illegal activity, though they are not the only vehicle to be so used. 4.13 In saying this, however, it is not intended to deny access to the LTC regime when shareholders have a connection to New Zealand and there are no potential reputational concerns, such as if a New Zealand family business has a shareholder that relocates to Australia for personal reasons. 4.14 Apart from reputational risks, there is the question of whether there are revenue risks associated with allowing conduit investments via a LTC. Our conclusion is that although there is some risk, it is not a major issue, for the following reasons: • Unlike ordinary companies, LTCs do not benefit from the interest deduction provision (section DB 7 of the Income Tax Act) that provides that a company’s interest expenses require no nexus with income to be deductible. This means that, on its face, a non-resident shareholder in a LTC could not deduct their share of a LTC’s interest expense incurred to derive foreign income. • Furthermore, an interest expense incurred by a LTC will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules to the extent it is owned by non-residents. The thin capitalisation rules restrict debt deductions based on a person’s assets that are within the New Zealand tax base. As such, a non-resident with shares in a LTC with both foreign and New Zealand assets will not be able to deduct any more interest under the thin capitalisation rules than if the LTC had only New Zealand assets. There is scope however, for LTCs to be geared up to the 60 percent safe harbour – even if that funding is, in substance, being used to fund offshore assets. 27 Proposed approach 4.15 We consider the status quo should be retained for LTCs that are used either for onshore investment into New Zealand or offshore investment out of New Zealand. This is an “on-balance” decision taking all the above factors into account. If, in the future, concerns emerged about the efficacy of the imputation system or about the material erosion of the tax base, we would need to revisit this decision. In doing so, we would want to consider the use of similar vehicles such as limited partnerships and trusts for inbound and outbound investment. 4.16 We do, however, consider it appropriate to restrict the ability for LTCs to earn offshore income in the conduit context. 4.17 One option for this restriction would be to apply the foreign income restriction in the QC rules, where there is effectively a cap on non-dividend foreign income. However, this approach might be viewed as unduly restrictive outside of the conduit situation, such as in cases when there might be a genuine option for an individual to earn foreign income through personal services. 4.18 Therefore, the proposal is to restrict the extent to which a company can derive foreign income and retain LTC status if it is controlled by non- resident shareholders. In order to retain LTC status when more than 50 percent of the shareholding in a LTC is held by non-residents, the LTC’s annual foreign income 25 would have to be restricted to the greater of $10,000 or 20 percent of the LTC’s gross income. This would be made an entry criterion. If this condition is breached during the income year, LTC status would be revoked for that year and any subsequent year that the condition was not met. 4.19 This approach should ameliorate any reputational risks related with conduit investment while providing flexibility for some degree of combined non- resident shareholding and foreign income. It should prevent a domestic family business inadvertently falling outside the rules through an owner emigrating. 4.20 It is important to note that addressing the LTC aspects of conduit investment does not necessarily mean that we are comfortable with conduit investments being made through other structures. Any wider review would, however, need to be undertaken as a separate project. As a general matter, we propose to monitor how different entities are used cross-border, especially in light of BEPS concerns and the broader international tax framework. 25 This would be all foreign income, not just non-dividend foreign income. The current QC restriction of $10,000 “foreign” income excludes passive dividend and interest income from overseas. However, given that the concern is particularly in relation to reputational risk, with some LTCs being used as tax sheltering/laundering vehicles, then including all foreign income in the proposed conduit limitation rule seems appropriate. 28 CHAPTER 5 Deduction limitation rule Introduction 5.1 The income earned and the expenditure incurred by a LTC are allocated for tax purposes to the shareholders on the basis of their respective ownership. The ability of each owner to use their share of the LTC’s expenditure deductions against their other income is determined by the deduction limitation rule. The rule was originally developed for limited partnerships, which generally are likely to be more sophisticated entities. 5.2 The deduction limitation rule is intended to ensure each owner cannot deduct tax expenses in excess of what they have invested in the business, which is referred to as their “owner’s basis”. Excess deductions can be a concern from both a revenue protection and economic efficiency perspective. Deductions in excess of the owner’s basis are required to be carried forward for offsetting against future income subject to having adequate “owner’s basis” at that point. 5.3 The deduction limitation rule applies to all LTCs, with all having to undertake the calculations even though in practice it only limits deductions in around one percent of cases. Consequently, the rule is one of the most heavily criticised features of the LTC rules, being criticised from a compliance cost as well as a technical perspective. The fact that the rule has such limited application is in part because, as Chart 1 illustrates, most LTCs fall into the -$20,000 to +$10,000 annual income range. Chart 1: LTC income – 2013 tax year 29 The current rule 5.4 At its very basic the owner’s basis is the net funds provided by the shareholder, that is, share capital plus loans to the LTC (whether by way o f actual funds or a guarantee by the investor or another party) minus disbursements to the shareholder. This rule is set out in section HB 11 of the Income Tax Act, using the following formula: investments – distributions + income – deductions – disallowed amounts where: investments is the sum of the equity, goods or assets introduced or services provided to the LTC, or any amounts paid by the owner on behalf of the LTC. This includes any loans, including shareholder current account credit balances, made by the owner to the LTC and their share of any LTC debt which they, or their associate, have guaranteed (or provided indemnities for); 26 distributions is anything paid out to the owner by the LTC, including dividends and loans, including shareholder current account debit balances. It does not include any salary or wages received by a working owner; income is the owner’s share of the LTC’s income (including exempt and excluded income) and realised capital gains from the current and any preceding income years (in which the company was an LTC); deductions is the owner’s share of the LTC’s deductions in the preceding income years (in which the company was an LTC) and any realised capital losses for the current or previous income years; disallowed amount is the amount of investments made by an owner within 60 days of the last day of the LTC’s income year if these are distributed or reduced within 60 days after the last day of the income year. This is to prevent the creation of an artificially high basis around the end of the year. To allow for normal operational cash-flow, if the reduction of investments within 60 days of the balance sheet date is less than $10,000, it can be ignored. 26 The rules include various definitions in relation to guarantors, owner’s associates and secured amounts. 30 Example In Table 5, the single owner advances $100,000 of capital. Revenue in each year is $60,000, of which $30,000 is exempt income and, therefore, non-taxable. Cash costs are $30,000 each year. The $30,000 of revenue that is tax exempt is distributed to the owner, so no cash is retained in the company. There are no disallowed amounts. The owner’s basis is calculated for the owner, as follows: Income 30,000 Costs 30,000 Interest 0 Exempt income 30,000 Capital gains 0 Net loss 0 Distribution 30,000 Table 5: No losses created, exempt income is distributed Y e a r Investment Distributions Income Prior year deductions Owner’s basis Current year deductions allowed Restricted deductions Cumulative taxable income 1 100,000 30,000 60,000 0 130,000 30,000 0 0 2 100,000 60,000 120,000 30,000 130,000 30,000 0 0 3 100,000 90,000 180,000 60,000 130,000 30,000 0 0 4 100,000 120,000 240,000 90,000 130,000 30,000 0 0 5 100,000 150,000 300,000 120,000 130,000 30,000 0 0 However, if instead all income were to be distributed, then ultimately deductions would be limited, as follows: Table 6: No losses created, all income is distributed Y e a r Investment Distributions Income Prior year deductions Owner’s basis Current year deductions allowed Restricted deductions Cumulative taxable income 1 100,000 60,000 60,000 0 100,000 30,000 0 0 2 100,000 120,000 120,000 30,000 70,000 30,000 0 0 3 100,000 180,000 180,000 60,000 40,000 30,000 0 0 4 100,000 240,000 240,000 90,000 10,000 10,000 20,000 20,000 5 100,000 300,000 300,000 120,000 -20,000 0 30,000 50,000 31 Problems with the current rule 5.5 There is a general perception that the current rule is overly complex for the target LTC audience, leading to material compliance costs that are unlikely to decrease over time. The calculation applies to every owner even though most will not have their deductions constrained by it because their share of costs is less than their owner’s basis. 27 If costs exceed available funds, the shareholder can provide more equity to fund the shortfall. Nevertheless, each owner needs to make an annual calculation to determine the amount of LTC expenditure that they can deduct. Even for profitable LTCs the calculation is needed, in case the LTC eventually makes a loss, or because some of their owners may have their deductions restricted because the rule limits deductions rather than losses. 5.6 Moreover, it can restrict deductions in some situations where all costs would be deductible if earned directly by the owners; for example, when not all of an owner’s economic interest is recognised such as when there is an unrealised capital gain. 5.7 Additionally, a range of technical issues have arisen in relation to how the rule and its defined terms, such as “secured amount” and “deductions”, work in practice. Some of these issues have led to legislative amendments but further changes seem necessary. Restricting the ability to apply losses against taxable income 5.8 Conceptually business deductions should be able to be offset against income to the extent they reflect economic costs, just as economic income (business profits and other gains that increase the value of the business) should also be taxable. Practically, there are certain restrictions on the deductions that can be claimed, just as there are restrictions on what constitutes income; for example, capital gains, which can be in effect a form of economic income, are taxed in only specific circumstances. 5.9 Given that LTCs are intended to be substitutes for direct ownership of assets in a closely held business, conceptually it seems appropriate to allow deductions when they would be deductible if the assets were owned directly. The exception would be where there are material differences in arrangements arising from incorporation that lead to excess deductions being claimed. 5.10 As an individual, the shareholder is in effect restricted to deductions that represent the economic costs that the individual has incurred. Those losses are able to be offset against an individual’s income from other sources, not just income on the investment or business. 5.11 In contrast, in widely held situations, there is generally a separation of entity and shareholder taxation so that losses cannot be transferred from the company to shareholders. 27 Around one percent of LTCs reported non-allowable deductions carried forward in 2013 – see Appendix 1. 32 5.12 Limited partnerships straddle the dichotomy between partnerships and widely held companies, with no limits on the number of persons who can be members of a limited partnership. In this way, they can be a substitute for a standard company, which means that they should face similar restrictions; hence there are deduction limitation rules for limited partnerships to ensure that deductions are not passed through when they are in excess of what is perceived to be at risk. 28 5.13 Although LTCs share many characteristics with limited partnerships, there are significant differences between the client groups and the purposes of LTCs and limited partnerships. In particular: • the limited partnership rules were introduced, in part, as a response to a perceived problem for in-bound venture capital. LTCs are targeted at closely controlled businesses, primarily with a domestic focus; • LTCs are restricted to five or fewer shareholders. Limited partnerships have no such limitat ion; • LTC shareholders can, and typically will, be active in the day-to-day operation of the business. Limited partners are theoretically restricted to a passive role in the business. 5.14 These differences suggest we can be more relaxed about LTC deductions. Furthermore, LTC shareholders are taxable on debt remission income of the LTC (the remission rules are discussed later in Chapter 8). Thus there is less need for a deduction limitation rule as a base protection mechanism. Robust LTC entry or qualifying criteria will also reduce concerns about removing the rule as they are a useful initial filter for arrangements that could result in the generation of excess losses. In these circumstances, our conclusion is that the deduction limitation rule is needed only in specific instances. When excess deductions arise that might justify restrictions 5.15 A common concern underlying the need for past restrictions on deductions has been when leveraging at the level of the company or partnership has provided significant interest deductions for the investor, without the obligation for the investor to repay the loan in the event that the project became insolvent. A variety of mechanisms were used to ensure the loans did not have to be repaid, ranging from the loan being provided on limited or non-recourse terms, to it being lent to a scheme-specific company and only secured over the assets of, and perhaps the shares in, the company. Other mechanisms included the use of put or call options over scheme assets or the use of “insurance policies”. 29 28 Internationally, limited partnerships pose substantial risks for domestic taxation and out-bound investments, with a number of jurisdictions placing restrictions on them, as a way to counteract mass-marketed tax shelter schemes. In such schemes, tax deductions often greatly exceeded the investments made by the “investors” with profits to investors often being entirely generated by the tax system. Limiting tax deductions to economic losses makes perfect sense in such situations. 29 It needs to be borne in mind, however, that the existence of a non-recourse loan, in a bona fide business arrangement, need not in itself be a problem. The same amount of interest would be deductible whether the loan was to the shareholder, or to the company, with or without a guarantee. In an arm’s length transaction, with no artificial arrangements, a financial institution would presumably only be willing to provide a loan secured against the assets of the company in situations where the probability of default was small and the assets were tangible. 33 5.16 Such ‘non-recourse’ schemes have typically involved: • a high-risk activity with apparently optimistic or unrealistic future sales projections, and property, including intangible and intellectual property, that is difficult to value; • the use of non-residents, tax-exempt organisations or tax loss companies so that any income is effectively exempt from New Zealand income tax; • investors putting relatively small amounts of their own money into the schemes but the promoter arranging instead for the investors to have access to loan money that is used to purchase high-value assets that diminish in value, at least for tax purposes, over time. 5.17 Specific “money-at-risk” rules 30 were enacted in 2003 to address the base erosion impact posed by these schemes, but those rules are very specific and predate LTCs. These rules were targeted at mass marketed schemes that typically, but not always, used LAQCs. The overall response to these schemes, including the use of other anti-avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act, has arguably been effective as mass marketed tax driven schemes since that time have been limited. 5.18 There is the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 that enables the Commissioner to void a tax avoidance arrangement for income tax purposes and to counteract a tax advantage that a person has obtained from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. Furthermore, the anti-avoidance rule in section GB 50 relating to the valuation of partners’ transactions is potentially of relevance, with so me modification. 5.19 In considering changes in relation to the anti-avoidance rules, we have been mindful that any proposals need to avoid replacing one set of compliance costs with another. Ultimately, the vast majority of LTCs and owners are conducting legitimate business activities and any resultant deductions are genuine. Arrangements involving partners 5.20 Section GB 50 replaces consideration paid by a partner with a market value amount when the arrangement has the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the partnership tax rules (in subpart HG). 5.21 This requirement was designed to protect the tax base, with the concern being the transfer of assets in and out of a partnership at under- and over- value, for tax benefits. For example, a controlling partner could introduce valuable assets into a partnership to accelerate their own tax deductions, say on depreciable property. 5.22 The rule is not intended to affect situations where non-market transactions between partners occur legitimately. It is therefore expressed as a specific 30 See sections GB 45 to GB 48 of the Income Tax Act. 34 anti-avoidance rule that essentially deems a transaction to have occurred at market value when the transaction is subject to an arrangement entered into to avoid tax. 5.23 Given that the LTC rules are based on the partnership rules, it seems logical to extend section GB 50 to include LTCs. This would at least address the valuation aspect, which is a likely feature of schemes that involve excessive deductions, irrespective of whether they are mass-marketed. Extending this rule to LTCs may, however, highlight some subtle differences. For example, a nil interest loan from a partner might be squared up through an adjustment to partners’ profit shares. Such a profit adjustment cannot be readily done in the case of LTC shareholders given that allocations are according to shareholdings, although some adjustment to shareholdings may be feasible to achieve a similar outcome. Feedback is sought on this point and the general application of the section GB 50 rule. Partnerships of LTCs 5.24 Partnerships of LTCs are used in certain business ventures. In effect, this is a widely held investment structure and replicates a limited partnership, but with the added advantage of each partner being able to be active in the business in some way. 5.25 From a policy perspective there is little cause for concern over partnerships of LTCs. However, this situation changes if the deduction limitation rule as it applies to LTCs is removed. Such a result has the potential to see limited partnerships being superseded by partnerships of LTCs as a preferred structure for widely held investments. 5.26 Limited partnerships have been designed as a structure to aid widely held investment where flow-through treatment is considered desirable. It therefore seems inconsistent to have an alternative structure that replicates the more favourable aspects of limited partnerships but without the restrictions that apply to them. 5.27 The deduction limitation rule should therefore be retained for partnerships of LTCs. Ideally this would be when there are more than five look-through counted owners in aggregate across the LTCs in the partnership. In other words, there would be more owners than would be allowed if the partnership’s activities were undertaken by a single LTC. Basing the application of the test on the number of combined owners, may, however, cause practical difficulties. This is because it puts the onus on each LTC to know how many owners there are in the other LTCs in the partnership which becomes complicated if there are trusts and family groups to consider. This may mean that, for simplicity, all partnerships of LTCs would need to apply the test. Feedback on this point is invited. 35 Transitional arrangements 5.28 The proposed removal in most cases of the deduction limitation rule raises the issue of what to do with those deductions that are limited up to the removal of the rule and have therefore been carried forward. Such restricted deductions average around $7m a year and are expected to have accumulated to $35m by 2016–17, which translates to a fiscal cost of $12m, spread over two years. Such deductions would become unrestricted from the 2017–18 income year and could, therefore, be offset against owners’ other income from that income year. Technical changes to the deduction limitation rule 5.29 We are proposing some technical changes to the deduction limitation rule to clarify its application for those who would continue to be covered by it. The changes involve: • a balance sheet based starting point for the calculation of “owner’s basis” for companies that enter the LTC regime; • the inclusion of unrealised gains on real property; and • further consideration of the treatment of guarantees, requiring among other things, that the guarantor be a person of substance and not the LTC itself. 5.30 Submissions are welcome on any other aspects of the rule that are causing concern. In the meantime, officials will continue to consider the detail of this rule with the aim of further simplification. Balance sheet based starting point 5.31 At the moment the tax law is unclear how the term “investments” in the formula is to be calculated in respect of an existing company that elects into the LTC regime. For example, the company may have been in existence for many years. A balance sheet based approach, with adjustments (such as reversal of revaluations except in respect of real property), would provide a clean starting point. Inclusion of unrealised capital gains into the current formula 5.32 An owner has money at risk even in relation to gains on capital assets that have not been realised. When the assets are intangible, valuing those gains with confidence can be problematic. However, in the case of real property, revaluations are already provided for in the mixed use assets rules in the Income Tax Act. Consequently, we are proposing that revaluations of real property, calculated in a similar fashion to the mixed use assets rules, be added to “owner’s basis”. 36 Possible alternative rule 5.33 We did consider whether a more fundamental change to the rule was needed, while retaining the principle of denying excessive deductions. Our conclusion was that any rule is inevitably going to be detailed given the variety of assets, liabilities and businesses that might be included in a LTC. The existing rule has been in place for several years in which case LTCs will be familiar with it and a new rule would involve another teething period. Furthermore, the proposed removal in most cases of the deduction limitation rule reduces the benefits from any fundamental rewrite of the rule. It seems preferable, therefore, to instead make some minor adjustments to the existing rule, as outlined above. However, it may be helpful to at least summarise some of our thinking on some possible alternative ways of designing a rule. This is included in Appendix 2. 37 38 CHAPTER 6 Qualifying companies What should be done about those companies that remain as QCs? 6.1 An aim of the review is to make the LTC rules more workable so that more small businesses can use them. If this objective is achieved, will the LTC rules be sufficient to cover all targeted small companies, including QCs? As discussed earlier, it is not desirable to have multiple regimes covering essentially similar types of businesses but with slightly different boundaries. This is particularly the case when those regimes are optional and it is relatively easy to switch from one to the other to minimise tax liabilities. 6.2 Furthermore, allowing existing QCs to continue will provide them with a permanent advantage, 31 leading to their being traded for tax purposes and potential involvement in undesirable tax behaviour. 6.3 While we might anticipate that the numbers of QCs will decline over time, the feedback from some stakeholders has been that the LTC regime is too limited to cover all closely held companies. For example, the requirement that there must be only one class of shares would preclude some QCs from becoming a LTC. As noted earlier, we intend to recommend allowing more than one class of shares, provided the only variation relates to voting rights. 6.4 Another concern is that some QCs may be deterred from transitioning into the LTC regime because under the LTC rules existing shareholders face tax consequences, such as depreciation claw-back and the taxation of any gains made on revenue account property upon exit from the LTC regime. To reduce compliance costs, the tax on the disposal of the underlying property is ignored when the tax adjustment is below certain thresholds. In contrast, under the QC rules the exiting shareholder is treated as selling their shareholding which in most cases would not have a tax consequence. Our conclusion is that although the tax consequence on disposal does create compliance costs, even with (or in some cases because of) the thresholds, it is difficult to find a robust alternative. Hence, recognising disposals seems to be a necessary feature of the LTC rules, as it is for ordinary partnerships. Proposed approach 6.5 On balance, our conclusion is that the existing QCs should be retained, but a QC should lose its QC status upon the sale of the company. The loss of QC status upon sale would discourage trading in QCs where that trading is driven by their tax advantage. 31 A QC can provide a better outcome from the perspective of a shareholder on a 33% personal tax rate as it allows capital gains to flow though to that shareholder while taxable income is taxed at the lower company tax rate until it is distributed. 39 6.6 The sale of the company would be measured by a change in control (that is, a change in shareholding of over 50 percent in aggregate). We envisage that this would involve applying a shareholder continuity type test to measure if control had been retained by the same group of owners, using as the continuity period the period commencing from the date of enactment of the legislation up to the date of sale of an interest in the LTC. 40 CHAPTER 7 Transitioning into the LTC regime Introduction 7.1 There are several issues in relation to the rules that apply on becoming a LTC. Entry formula 7.2 We are proposing to amend the adjustment done at the time of entering into the LTC regime. The adjustment is intended to reflect the fact that retained earnings earned before becoming a LTC would have been taxable in the hands of shareholders if distributed before the company became a LTC. This in effect provides a square-up or clean slate on entry given that any distribution by the LTC will be tax-free. The adjustment amount becomes income for the LTC owners. 7.3 The income adjustment is based on the income that would arise if the company had been liquidated immediately before becoming a LTC, except that unrealised gains are not realised. The formula is: dividends + balances – assessable income – balances – exit exemption tax rate where: dividends is the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if immediately before becoming a LTC the property of the company, other than cash, were disposed of at market value and the company met all its liabilities at market value and it was liquidated and the net cash amount was distributed to shareholders without imputation credits or foreign dividend payment credits attached. In other words a liquidation took place; balances is the sum of the balances in the imputation credit account and foreign dividend payment credit account immediately before becoming a LTC, plus amounts of income tax payable for an earlier income year but not paid before the relevant date, less refunds due for the earlier income year but paid after the relevant date; assessable income is the amount of income that would arise as a result of liquidation less any deductions that the company would have as a result of liquidating. This includes depreciation gains or losses, bad debts and disposals of revenue account property; tax rate is the company tax rate in the income year before the income year in which the company becomes a LTC; exit exemption is the exit dividends that, if the company had previously been a LTC and is now re-entering the LTC rules, would be attributed to 41 any retained reserves from the previous LTC period that have not since been distributed; 7.4 For compliance cost reasons, the adjustment formula uses the company tax rate, currently 28%, but this means that no further tax is paid by LTC shareholders on fully imputed income, which is contrary to the liquidation concept. Example If on liquidation there would be a $72 dividend with $28 imputations credits attached, the formula produces an answer of $0 additional income. In contrast, upon a real liquidation and for a shareholder on a tax rate of 33%, $5 more tax would be payable. 7.5 The question of whether utilising the LTC rules to take advantage of any under-taxation and subsequently liquidating would be considered tax avoidance by Inland Revenue has been raised in a number of fora in recent years. As a result Inland Revenue issued a Question We Have Been Asked (QWBA) on the issue as part of a wider QWBA (No. 14/11) on tax avoidance scenarios. That QWBA indicated that avoidance will be considered to arise if there is an arrangement that involves an election to become a LTC and to subsequently liquidate. 7.6 However, irrespective of whether avoidance is an issue, there is still a tax rate advantage for shareholders on 30% and 33% marginal tax rates. Conversely, if the company has a predominance of shareholders who are on marginal tax rates less than 28%, then overall there is an over-taxation on becoming a LTC. 7.7 To achieve a more equitable outcome, we are proposing that the adjustment formula in section CB 32C(5) should be replaced with a formula that ensures the income that arises is taxed at shareholders’ marginal tax rates, rather than the company rate of 28%. 32 The new formula would treat the retained income and imputation credits that would arise on liquidation of the company as being distributed to the individual LTC shareholders who would include the income and imputation credits in their return of income. This approach would leave it to each individual shareholder to determine what tax rate applies to their share of the income. Allocating out the income and imputation credits would produce a fairer tax outcome but would result in additional compliance costs. Example Taking the earlier example, this would mean the shareholder on a tax rate of 33% would receive a dividend of $72 with $28 imputation credits attached, and a further $5 would be payable. 32 A similar gap on entry into the qualifying company rules was rectified several years ago. 42 QCs transitioning to LTCs 7.8 An associated issue is how to treat transitioning QCs under the adjustment formula. Conceptually, the outcome should be, as above, as if the QC had been liquidated. Under this approach the revised formula would make it clear that consistent with the QC liquidation rules, unimputed amounts would not be taxed. 7.9 Previously, QCs had a two year exemption window, to encourage conversion, which included exemption from the entry formula. This is in fact not a “free” conversion as effectively imputation credits are lost, which is akin to taxing all shareholders at 28% with no subsequent square-up on taxed income. Although this benefits shareholders on 30% and 33% marginal tax rates, it disadvantages those on lesser marginal rates. Whether it results in a more tax advantageous outcome than under allocating out the income and imputation credits to all shareholders, therefore, depends on the composition of shareholders and their marginal tax rates. A QC with a preponderance of low tax-rate shareholders would always have the choice of making a distribution before electing to become a LTC, to avoid any tax disadvantage. 7.10 On balance, we are proposing that the standard liquidation approach should be applied. This means that not only would an entry adjustment be required, modified as suggested above, but also losses that had accumulated in the QC could not be carried over to the LTC. Allowing QC accumulated losses to be carried over would have a significant fiscal cost which would be hard to justify. 7.11 This would not, however, affect entitlements to losses transferred on conversion during the two year exemption window (under section DV 23). Those transferred losses have been able to be used to the extent that there has been LTC income post-conversion and this will continue to be the case. Values at time of entry 7.12 A retrospective technical change should be made to clarify the values at which a LTC’s assets and liabilities are deemed to be held by the LTC owners and in the LTC accounts when an ordinary company or QC converts to a LTC. They should be based on the tax book values of the ordinary company or QC immediately before conversion. 43 44 CHAPTER 8 Debt remission Introduction 8.1 Under current policy settings debt remission generates taxable income for the LTC’s shareholders. This is because of the interaction of the LTC rules with the financial arrangements rules. There is concern that when a shareholder is also the creditor this outcome can be inappropriate because the shareholder will have suffered a non-deductible loss on the same loan. This chapter discusses this issue and how it can be resolved. 8.2 Outside of the above situation, the chapter discusses a legislative clarification to ensure that the debt remission income arises as intended when a LTC either liquidates or elects out of the LTC rules. Related parties debt remission in asymmetric situations 8.3 The February 2015 consultation document Related parties debt remission dealt with situations where the debt, if capitalised, would lead to no change in ownership of the debtor. These aspects are not further discussed in this paper. 8.4 However, for “look through” entities (ordinary partnerships, limited partnerships and LTCs) there is a variation of this situation that also seems to result in an inappropriate outcome. The issue is, therefore, not necessarily confined to LTCs. 8.5 Consider a simple LTC situation with several shareholders, all of whom are unrelated. One of those owners lends a sum of money to the LTC. This loan would be a financial arrangement and therefore subject to the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW of the Income Tax Act. Sometime later the LTC is in financial difficulty and the loan is remitted, giving rise to debt remission income. 8.6 Under current tax law all shareholders would derive debt remission income in proportion to their respective shareholdings. From a policy perspective this outcome is logical for the shareholders that did not advance the loan as they have in effect made a gain. 8.7 However, the creditor shareholder has actually made an economic loss (of the portion that is “attributed” to the other shareholders). Yet that shareholder is taxed on their share of the remission income with no tax deduction for their actual lo ss. 33 This result is not the desired policy outcome. 33 Even though a base price adjustment is required, the base price adjustment formula in effect negates the loss arising from the non-payment by including the amount remitted. 45 Example George and Mario own, respectively, 60 percent and 40 percent of GEL Enterprises Limited (GEL), a look through company. In addition, George has advanced $1 million to GEL. Some years later GEL is effectively insolvent and George chooses to remit the loan. From a taxation perspective, Mario derives taxable debt remission income from GEL’s base price adjustment (the BPA) of $400,000 and there are no policy problems with this. George derives $600,000 of taxable debt remission income but is denied a tax deduction for any of his $1 million loss. Economically George has lost a net $400,000, but he has taxable income of $600,000. Proposed solution 8.8 The proposal is to turn off the creditor shareholder’s share of the debt remission income. Example In the above example, this would mean George would not have the $600,000 debt remission income so that overall he would be $400,000 out of pocket which matches the transfer to Mario, and Mario is taxed on that transfer as debt remission income. 8.9 Submissions on this proposal and on an appropriate application date are welcome. The change could be backdated to the inception of the LTC rules (1 April 2011) but this could result in compliance and administrative costs. We seek feedback on the extent to which shareholders of LTCs who have lent money to the LTC have found themselves in the above situation and have had to pay tax. Loans to partnerships 8.10 Arguably the above approach should also apply to a creditor partner’s share of debt remission income when a partner has made a loan to a partnership and the loan cannot be subsequently repaid. Comments on this aspect and examples of practical situations in which it has been a problem are welcome. Clarifying remission income on exiting the LTC rules 8.11 A concern underlying the removal of LAQCs was their use in the avoidance of remission income. Under standard tax rules a taxpayer can claim a deduction for an expenditure or loss for income tax purposes when it is incurred, even if payment has not taken place. Normally this is not an issue as any unpaid portion of expenditure is subsequently clawed back through the remitted income rules. However, shareholders of LAQCs could avoid this remissio n inco me. 46 8.12 Remission income arises in the year of remission, rather than in the year in which the deduction was originally claimed. 34 If remission income arose in an income year after the company had revoked its LAQC status, the directors and shareholders were not personally liable for the tax liability of the company, as that liability only applied in respect of an income year during which the company was an LAQC. As a result, shareholders could claim LAQC losses and then eliminate personal liability for the tax on the remitted income simply by revoking LAQC status before remission income was derived by the LAQC. The intention was that this outcome could not be achieved through a LTC. 8.13 The Income Tax Act makes it clear that remission income is intended to arise for LTC owners when they either elect to take their company out of the LTC rules or the LTC is liquidated, through their deeming to have disposed of their interests at market value. There has been some debate over whether this is the outcome in practice, although the intention is clear. 8.14 The issue is around the market value of any impaired third party loans at the time of disposal, with some practitioners arguing that the market value of a loan, distressed or not, is the present value of its future cash flows without considering its distressed impairment. This approach ignores the risk associated with the loan. 35 There are suggestions that this argument is being used to avoid remission income from distressed debt when a LTC “elects” out of the LTC regime or liquidates. Proposed solution 8.15 A retrospective amendment is proposed to put an end to the above debate and to ensure that the debt remission income rules apply as intended – in other words remission income does arise for LTC owners when they either liquidate or elect to take their company out of the LTC rules. 34 Remission income includes an amount of debt that has been forgiven to a debtor. 35 That risk should, however, be reflected in the market price that a third party would be prepared to pay for the loan. 47 48 CHAPTER 9 Dividend simplification Introduction 9.1 In addition to changes to the LTC rules, the review has considered whether changes should be made to the rules around distributions/dividends made by close companies that are not LTCs, and not in many cases QCs. The issues that we have been considering in this area are: • ways to ensure that genuine capital gains made by small businesses do not become taxable merely because there is a transaction involving an associated party. There is scope to liberalise the current restrictions in this area; • whether resident withholding tax (RWT) obligations can optionally be removed from small companies, subject to the company or its directors providing guarantees. This would be designed to reduce an area of compliance costs; • likewise, whether the requirement to deduct RWT from fully imputed dividends between companies could be optionally removed; • ways of streamlining RWT obligations when cash and non-cash dividends are paid concurrently. Again this would reduce compliance costs and produce more sensible outcomes; • whether small businesses could be given the option of treating shareholder salaries as subject to a combination of PAYE and provisional tax. This would be aimed at providing businesses with greater flexibility. Tainted capital gains when capital asset sold to non-corporate associated person 9.2 This issue concerns the distribution of capital gains and the associated party rules, particularly where there is a family business reorganisation. The basic issue can be illustrated by the following example: 49 Example Mark is the sole shareholder of C Ltd, which purchases two farms for $100,000 each. Mark has two sons, Henry and James, who each live on one of the farms. When Mark retires, his shares in C Ltd are transferred to his sons equally. Soon after, Henry’s farm is transferred from C Ltd to himself. The transaction is concluded by Henry selling his shares to James for $150,000 (actual market value) and using the proceeds to buy the farm on which he resides also at the market value of $150,000; there is, prima facie, a $50,000 capital gain for C Ltd. When C Ltd eventually liquidates, a $50,000 taxable dividend arises on the distribution of the gain from the sale of Henry’s farm, because it was transferred to an associated person. The $50,000 gain does not qualify as a capital gain of the type that can be distributed tax-free under the company liquidation rules, because of the sale from C Ltd to Henry was to an associated person. Consequently, the gain is referred to as being ‘tainted’. 9.3 The policy rationale for treating a gain from the sale of an asset to an associated person as tainted is to prevent an asset being transferred around a group of companies for the purposes of creating additional amounts of capital reserves that may be distributed tax-free. The restriction dates back to the 1980s. 9.4 The original rationale only holds if the sale is to a company, but in practice the restriction also encompasses genuine transactions where the sale is not to a company. In other words, the restriction seems to extend beyond its intended ambit. Companies can be inadvertently caught by the rule, resulting in their being unable to be subsequently liquidated without a tax impost. Proposed solution 9.5 To reduce the ambit of the restriction, we propose that the tainting rules should not apply when the associated person purchaser is not a corporate. This amendment would be restricted to companies meeting the current definition of “close company”, that is, a company that has five or fewer natural persons the total of whose voting interests in the company is more than 50 percent (treating all natural persons associated at the time as one natural person). Potential related issue 9.6 It is not uncommon for a family-type company to go through a development phase and then either its shares or its assets are sold to a different organisation. When the former owners of the company have no interests in the new organisation this yields a non-tainted result. 9.7 However, when the acquiring organisation is a company in which the former owners end up owning shares as a result of the transaction, they might end up being associated persons. This would result in a tainted capital gain. We are hesitant to make changes in this area given the scope for inflating gains, the rationale behind the limitation. However, we will continue to analyse the issue and invite submissions on it. 50 Tainted capital gains when capital asset owned by more than one company in a group of companies 9.8 A similar concern about a possible over-valuation arises when a capital asset moves around a group of companies. This can be illustrated in the following example: Example A Ltd and B Ltd are 100 percent commonly owned group companies. A Ltd purchases a property for $100. Several years later A Ltd sells the property to B Ltd for $1,000. A Ltd records a gain on sale of $900. Several years later, Person Z, who is not associated with A Ltd and B Ltd, purchases the property from B Ltd for $1,200 and A Ltd and B Ltd are then liquidated. Under current law, a taxable dividend of $900 arises from A Ltd on liquidation because the property was sold to an associated person (B Ltd) and therefore the gain is not recognised as a capital profit. B Ltd can distribute $200 tax-free to its shareholders (being $1,200 less $1,000). Had the property not been transferred between A Ltd and B Ltd, but instead brought by a non- associated person/company for $1,200 shortly before A Ltd’s liquidation, the full $1,100 gain ($1,200- $100) could have been distributed tax-free. Proposed solution 9.9 When there is a group of companies and one of the companies sells an asset to an unrelated third party, the extent to which the capital profit on the sale would qualify for a tax-free distribution on liquidation would be determined with reference to the original cost of the asset, ignoring any tainted gains arising from previous intra-group sales of the asset. 9.10 There would be no limit on the type of companies to which this could apply. RWT compliance issues 9.11 There are several issues with the application of RWT to dividend and interest payments made by closely held companies to their shareholders. Dividends 9.12 Subject to the attachment of imputation credits, the RWT rate on dividends is a flat 33%. The lowering of the company tax rate to 28% means that even fully imputed dividends must have RWT deducted. This creates a compliance burden on companies, and in particular SME companies that pay fully imputed dividends. It also creates over-taxation for corporate shareholders who suffer RWT deductions from fully imputed dividends and for individual shareholders who are not on the top personal tax rate. Any excess RWT then needs to be claimed as a refund when the tax return for the relevant income year is filed, which not only means refund delays but also a 51 compliance burden on those individuals who may not otherwise have had to file a return. 9.13 Two specific compliance issues that have been raised with us in relation to the timing of dividend payments and associated RWT deductions are: • RWT is due the month after the dividend is “paid”, but for many companies the dividend’s quantum is sometimes not determined until after this time. • It is common practice to retrospectively clear a shareholder’s overdrawn account by a year-end credit for dividends. This credit is deemed to arise on the later of the first day of the relevant income year or the date the “loan” (by way of overdrawn account) was made; so that no tax or FBT arises on the “loan”. However this treatment does not apply if tax is deducted from the dividend. Because the company tax rate change means that RWT is now required to be deducted from all dividends, whether fully imputed or not, the ability to backdate a dividend to clear an overdrawn account no longer exists. Interest 9.14 On interest, the RWT varies according to the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. It is common for companies to pay interest to associated persons. Again, if RWT on this interest did not need to be accounted for there would seemingly be compliance savings for the payer. 9.15 These matters were considered in the review. Possible solution 9.16 One possible solution would be to allow a close company to elect to remove RWT on its dividends, and possibly interest payments, to shareholders (and persons associated with shareholders), subject to the directors of the company providing a guarantee that they will pay the tax on any untaxed part of the imputed dividend or interest payment should the shareholders fail to do so. A directors’ guarantee would be considered a necessary backstop even though the shareholders and the company would be likely to be closely linked. 9.17 There would be both compliance cost savings for the paying company and very likely administration cost savings with this approach, especially when returns are manually prepared. However, some of the compliance costs would be switched from the payer to the recipient. Some recipients of the dividends or interest may face increased compliance costs through having to file a tax return when they would not otherwise have to do so and/or through having to pay provisional tax when they are currently under the provisional tax threshold. 9.18 The optional removal of RWT would also give rise to fiscal costs from the deferral of tax. Some of this deferral is transitional, involving the deferral of tax that would have been paid in the first year of the change as RWT to its being paid as a combination of terminal tax and higher provisional tax 52 payments in the following year. This one-off retiming of payments accounts for much of the deferral. However, there is also a permanent deferral for those who would have had RWT deducted in the current year but who instead for all future years pay the tax by way of terminal tax in the following year. Added to this is a higher potential for non-compliance in the absence of a withholding tax. Our best estimates of these various elements in combination is as follows: Table 7: Fiscal costs of possible RWT solutions Optional removal of: Year 1 ($m) Year 2 ($m) Year 3 ($m) Year 4 ($m) Year 5 ($m) RWT on dividends -145 +102 -4 -4 -4 RWT on interest -161 +117 -2 -2 -2 9.19 It is not clear that the possible compliance savings warrant incurring such fiscal costs. In these circumstances, these matters would best be considered in the wider context of the work being undertaken to streamline business tax processes, as discussed in the Government green paper Making Tax Simpler (March 2015). Part of this work involves looking at ways to streamline the methods for paying tax more generally. 9.20 In deriving these estimates, it is assumed that the dividend RWT is received in the fiscal year before it is claimed by the receiving shareholders. However, it has been suggested to us that the recognition of some dividend RWT payments may in fact arise later. We are interested in feedback on what is the current practice in terms of paying the RWT, including in relation to clearing a shareholder’s overdrawn current account. Associated issue – RWT on dividends between companies 9.21 The lowering of the company tax rate to 28% has also meant that even fully imputed dividends between companies are subject to RWT unless they are part of the same wholly owned group or the recipient holds a certificate of exemption. Giving the paying company the option of not withholding RWT in such cases would lower compliance and administration costs in relation to those companies who are able to readily identify their corporate shareholders. This should be of benefit to a wide range of companies. It is expected to have only a transitional fiscal cost ($9m, in the first year of application). Proposed solution 9.22 When a fully imputed dividend is paid to another company, applying RWT to that dividend would be optional. 53 Cash and non-cash (taxable bonus) dividends 9.23 The contemporaneous payment of a cash and non-cash dividend (such as a taxable bonus issue) is regarded as being two separate dividends. Consequentially, the RWT can be higher than it should. 9.24 Sections RE 13 and RE 14 of the Income Tax Act, respectively, deal with the amount of RWT necessary for cash and non-cash (other than taxable bonus issues) dividends, as fo llows: Cash dividends 9.25 The section RE 13 formula is: RWT = (tax rate × (dividend paid + tax paid or credit attached)) – tax paid or credit attached where: tax rate is the basic tax rate applying to dividends, that is 33%; dividend paid is the net amount of the dividend before the addition of credits; tax paid or credit attached is imputation credits and FDP credits (or foreign withholding tax paid or payable on the dividend where the company is not resident in New Zealand). Example A cash dividend of $72 with imputation credits of $28, and no FDP credits: RWT = (0.33 × ($72 + $28)) – $28 = $5 Non-cash dividends other than bonus issues in lieu 9.26 The section RE 14 formula is: RWT = (tax rate × dividend paid / (1 – tax rate)) – tax paid or dividend attached 9.27 The key point is that “dividend paid / (1 – tax rate)” is a gross-up calculation to allow the gross dividend including both imputation credits and RWT to be calculated. 54 Example A non-cash dividend of $72 with imputation credits of $28, and no FDP credits: RWT = (0.33 × $72 /(1 - .33)) - $28 = $7.46 The gross dividend in this case is, therefore, $72 + $28 + $7.46 = $107.46, 36 in other words the dividend has been grossed-up for the RWT amount. This is because RWT cannot be deducted out of a non-cash amount. 9.28 Now take the situation where both a cash dividend and a non-cash dividend are paid out contemporaneously with the objective of using the cash dividend to pay the RWT on both the cash dividend and the non-cash dividend. In such a situation gross-up should be unnecessary. Example A cash dividend of $5 and non-cash dividend of $67, with imputation credits over both dividends of $28. Intuitively, this is equivalent to a gross dividend of $100 with imputation credits of $28, on which RWT would be $5, with no gross-up necessary. However, under the current legislation, a gross-up is required on the non–cash dividend. Proposal 9.29 The proposal is to provide the option of combining cash and non-cash dividend payments as a single cash payment, where the cash dividend alone is sufficient to cover the total RWT. 9.30 A legislative amendment would be required to enable the two dividends to be treated as a single dividend. It would only apply when the cash dividend was sufficient to cover the RWT for both dividends (so RWT would be paid by deduction, rather than gross-up). In such cases, the term “dividends paid” in section RE 13 would include both the cash and non-cash dividends, that is, the formula for determining the amount of RWT would be: tax rate × (cash dividend + non-cash dividend + tax paid or credit attached) – tax paid or credit attached 9.31 There would be no limit on the type of companies to which this could apply, although it is likely to be particularly relevant for closely-held companies that are not LTCs. 36 Tax at 33% on this gross amount of $107.46 equals the sum of the tax credits ($28) and RWT ($7.46), that is $35.46. 55 Shareholder salaries 9.32 Shareholder salaries are theoretically either totally subject to PAYE or not subject to PAYE at all. There have been suggestions that allowing a combination of PAYE and provisional tax would be helpful, in particular when the base amount is subject to PAYE. 9.33 Under section RD 3, a shareholder-employee in a “close company” who either: • does not derive as an employee salary or wages of a regular amount for regular periods of one month or less throughout the income year or that total 66 percent or more of their annual gross income in the corresponding tax year as an employee, or • is not paid an amount as income that may later be allocated to them as an employee for the income year, can choose to treat all amounts paid to them in the income year in their capacity as an employee as not subject to PAYE. This “no PAYE” option is designed to deal with situations where the annual “salary” is not known until after year-end – that is, it is dependent on the year-end results. The employee then includes the income in their tax return and there may be provisio nal tax implicat ions. 9.34 The provision predates imputation and, therefore, focuses on preventing double taxation of “family” type companies by allowing pre-tax profits to be designated as shareholder’s salary in qualifying circumstances. This payment mechanism is still widely accepted and used today. Proposal 9.35 A combination of PAYE on some payments and no PAYE on others should be an option available to shareholder-emplo yees of close co mpanies. This would be available when a base salary is provided to the employee (which would be subject to PAYE) but the overall salary payments would not be known until after year-end because it is dependent on the year-end results. Such an approach, if adopted, should be applied consistently from year to year so that a shareholder-employee should not be allowed to swap in and out of the provisional tax regime. 9.36 This change would also impact on QCs as well as other closely controlled companies given the current definition of “close company” in the Income Tax Act. 56 APPENDIX 1 Statistics Profile of QCs, LAQCs and LTCs Table 8 shows that there were a large number of LAQCs and QCs before the 2010 Budget. The vast majority (95 percent) were LAQCs, suggesting that access to losses at the personal level was a major attraction in the format ion of QCs. Most LAQCs with act ivit y (about 80 percent) attributed losses. However, around 20 percent of LAQCs were tax-paying. These could have been companies in cyclical industries, or they could have represented companies that had start-up losses after they were established, but had now matured and become profitable; or profitable firms that might eventually have losses to attribute. Table 8: Number of QCs and LAQCs in 2009 tax year QCs Number Profit making 4,257 Loss making 1,902 Nil returns 1,457 Total 7,616 LAQCs Profit making 24,377 Loss making 84,624 Nil returns 27,041 Total 136,042 Total (QCs + LAQCs) 143,658 LAQC as % of total 94.7% Since the 2010 reforms, the composition has changed significantly. Companies that were LAQCs have become either QCs or LTCs. However, Table 9 indicates that there are fewer entities overall in these categories, suggesting that some have chosen to wind up or carry out business under another form. Many of these new LTCs are involved in real property. This tallies with earlier data on the distribution of QC/LAQC losses by industry, as shown in Table 10. 57 Table 9: Total numbers of LAQCs, QCs and LTCs since 2010 reforms Tax year 2011 2012 2013 LAQCs 133,617 1,310 0 QCs 6,282 80,346 68,844 LTCs 0 43,826 46,182 Before Budget 2010, half the companies passing through losses were in the property industry. But loss pass-throughs were widely distributed across the other industries. For most industries, around half the firms were passing through losses. Table 10: Distribution of loss pass-throughs by industry for 2011 Percent of total losses passed through Number pass through Percent of firms in industry passing losses through Average loss % Number % $ Agriculture 16 5,289 49 $61,000 Mining 0 43 43 $70,000 Manufacturing 3 1,668 46 $38,000 Utility & waste 0 62 45 $16,000 Construction 3 2,277 36 $29,000 Wholesale trade 2 1,136 47 $28,000 Retail trade 5 3,384 50 $30,000 Food/accommodation 5 2,497 65 $39,000 Transport 2 1,045 48 $33,000 Information/telecom 0 470 58 $19,000 Finance/insurance 3 1,948 62 $27,000 Property 47 41,862 83 $22,000 Professional service 3 3,237 42 $19,000 Admin service 1 506 52 $22,000 Public admin 0 27 38 $0 Education 0 281 50 $21,000 Healthcare/social 1 568 34 $46,000 Arts & recreation 1 598 62 $32,000 Other services 1 1,060 49 $20,000 Not elsewhere included 1 1,263 75 $21,000 Unknown industry 4 3,880 70 $21,000 Total 100 73,101 65 $27,000 58 Distributions of LTC and QC income and losses Charts 2 and 3 show the distribution of reported income and losses for LTCs and QCs in 2013. 80 percent of LTCs fell into the loss/income range -$30,000 to +$10,000 while 80 percent of QCs fell within the -$20,000 to +$20,000 range. Given that LTCs allow loss flow-through, it is not surprising that a higher proportion of LTCs were reporting losses, although the difference is not great.

The number of look-through owners affected was 695. The average value of non-allowable deductions carried forward per owner was $16,547.

These were: “Money at risk” versus “good money” An alternative to the current owner’s money at risk approach would be to focus on the “good” money in the business. Under the “good money” approach deductions could be higher as long as they are genuine. For example, the owners would be allowed more deductions to the extent that the LTC has loans from third parties that are not subject to any security or guarantee provided by its owners. A prime example of such third party financing would be negative pledge financing from a bank – this is genuine business financing but is not money that the owners have at risk. Deductions would be allowed for a standard company but could not be passed through to shareholders to offset against their other income. In most cases, however, lenders would require security on any lending in which case the “at risk” and “good money” approaches should be broadly comparable. Per LTC or per owner The current rule calculates each owner’s “money at risk” and limits their deductions to that amount. The rule could alternatively be calculated on a per LTC basis, which may be simpler. Under the per LTC approach any restrictions on deductions would automatically flow through to owners according to their shareholding, irrespective of the amount that each owner has at risk. A possible drawback to this approach is that it could produce a different allocation than under the current rule when owners have provided differing levels of lending or guarantees. This might lead to negotiations among owners to maintain relativities. The rule would ignore this aspect. A further issue is where there is a change of shareholding in the LTC – the new owner would have a different “owner’s basis” and reconciling this may not be easy. Starting with shareholders’ funds Using shareholders’ funds at year-end, as taken from the annual accounts, as the starting point rather than adding investments and other inflows, less outflows, since inception of the LTC could be simpler in the longer term. Net shareholders’ funds automatically takes realised capital gains into account but there would need to be adjustments to deduct: • any revaluations of assets other than real property; • overdrawn shareholders’ current accounts and any loans to associates of shareholders; • any unrecorded impairment where assets are significantly overvalued; and • intangible assets owned by the LTC. 63 To this would need to be added: • loans from shareholders or associated non-corporate persons; and • loans to the LTC that are not already counted that are unconditionally guaranteed by the shareholders or persons of substance associated with the shareholders. 64
