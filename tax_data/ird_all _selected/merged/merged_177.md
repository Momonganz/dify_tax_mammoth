Section YC 2 provides: YC 2 Voting interests Percentage of shareholder decision-making rights (1) A person’s voting interest in a company equals the percentage of the total shareholder decision-making rights for the company carried by shares or options held by the person. When decision-making rights vary (2) Despite subsection (1), if the percentage of shareholder decision-making rights for a company carried by shares or options held by any person differs as between the types of decision-making listed in the definition of shareholder decision-making right, the person’s voting interest in the company equals the average of those differing percentages. 3. Section YC 3 provides: YC 3 Market value interests Percentage of market value (1) A person’s market value interest in a company equals the percentage of the total market value of shares and options over shares in the company that the market value of shares and options over shares in the company held by the person represents. Adjustments for options (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the market value of any share in a company that is subject to an option is calculated having regard to the terms of the option. 4. A “shareholder decision-making right” is defined in s YA 1 as follows: shareholder decision-making right - means a right, carried by a share issued by a company or an option over a share issued by a company, to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning— (a) a dividend or other distribution to be paid or made by the company, whether on a liquidation of the company or otherwise, excluding decision-making undertaken by directors acting only in their capacity as directors; or (b) the constitution of the company; or (c) a variation in the capital of the company; or (d) the appointment of a director of the company Companies Act 1993 5. Section 2 sets out the definition of “entitled persons” as follows: entitled person, in relation to a company, means— (a) a shareholder; and (b) a person upon whom the constitution confers any of the rights and powers of a shareholder: 6. Section 36 provides: 36 Rights and powers attaching to shares (1) Subject to subsection (2), a share in a company confers on the holder— 20 (a) the right to 1 vote on a poll at a meeting of the company on any resolution, including any resolution to— (i) appoint or remove a director or auditor: (ii) adopt a constitution: (iii) alter the company's constitution, if it has one: (iv) approve a major transaction: (v) approve an amalgamation of the company under section 221: (vi) put the company into liquidation: (b) the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board: (c) the right to an equal share in the distribution of the surplus assets of the company. (2) Subject to section 53, the rights specified in subsection (1) may be negated, altered, or added to by the constitution of the company or in accordance with the terms on which the share is issued under section 41(b) or section 42 or section 44 or section 107(2), as the case may be. 7. Section 107 provides: 107 Unanimous assent to certain types of action (1) Notwithstanding section 52 but subject to section 108, if all entitled persons have agreed or concur,— (a) a dividend may be authorised otherwise than in accordance with section 53: (b) a discount scheme may be approved otherwise than in accordance with section 55: (c) shares in a company may be acquired otherwise than in accordance with sections 59 to 65: (d) shares in a company may be redeemed otherwise than in accordance with sections 69 to 72: (e) financial assistance may be given for the purpose of, or in connection with, the purchase of shares otherwise than in accordance with sections 76 to 80: (f) any of the matters referred to in section 161(1) may be authorised otherwise than in accordance with that section. (2) If all entitled persons have agreed or concur, shares may be issued otherwise than in accordance with section 42 or section 44 or section 45. (3) If all entitled persons have agreed to or concur in a company entering into a transaction in which a director is interested, nothing in sections 140 and 141 shall apply in relation to that transaction. (4) For the purposes of this section, no agreement or concurrence of the entitled persons is valid or enforceable unless the agreement or concurrence is in writing. (5) An agreement or concurrence may be— (a) a separate agreement to, or concurrence in, the particular exercise of the power referred to; or (b) an agreement to, or concurrence in, the exercise of the power generally or from time to time.

(7) Where a power is exercised pursuant to an agreement or concurrence referred to in subsection (5)(b), the board of the company must, within 10 working days of the exercise of the power, send to every entitled person a notice in writing containing details of the exercise of the power. (8) If the board of a company fails to comply with subsection (7), every director of the company commits an offence and is liable on conviction to the penalty set out in section 374(1). 21 8. Section 117 provides: 117 Alteration of shareholder rights (1) A company must not take action that affects the rights attached to shares unless that action has been approved by a special resolution of each interest group. (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the rights attached to a share include— (a) the rights, privileges, limitations, and conditions attached to the share by this Act or the constitution, including voting rights and rights to distributions: (b) pre-emptive rights arising under section 45: (c) the right to have the procedure set out in this section, and any further procedure required by the constitution for the amendment or alteration of rights, observed by the company: (d) the right that a procedure required by the constitution for the amendment or alteration of rights not be amended or altered. (3) For the purposes of subsection (1), the issue of further shares ranking equally with, or in priority to, existing shares, whether as to voting rights or distributions, is deemed to be action affecting the rights attached to the existing shares, unless— (a) the constitution of the company expressly permits the issue of further shares ranking equally with, or in priority to, those shares; or (b) the issue is made in accordance with the pre-emptive rights of shareholders under section 45 or under the constitution of the company.

Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Summary 1. This item deals with the deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure – that is, the transaction costs incurred in connection with obtaining borrowed funds (“borrowing-related expenditure”). This does not include interest, the deductibility of which is dealt with by specific provisions in the Act (in particular, ss DB 6 – DB 10B). 2 2. Borrowing-related expenditure may be deductible under the financial arrangements rules (“the FA rules”), under s DA 1 (the general deductibility provision), or under s DB 5 (which provides for the deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money for use as capital in deriving income). The deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure may need to be determined under subpart DG, if it relates to a mixed-use asset (see further \[57\]). This statement is primarily about how s DB 5 applies (from \[55\]), but it also identifies when borrowing-related expenditure may be deductible under the FA rules or under s DA 1, rather than under s DB 5. It is necessary to consider whether a particular item of expenditure is taken into account under the FA rules before considering deductibility under s DA 1 or s DB 5, because the FA rules generally prevail over any other provision in the Act in relation to the timing and quantifying of income and expenditure under financial arrangements to which the FA rules apply. 3. The types of borrowing-related expenditure that will typically either be deductible under the FA rules or under s DB 5 include legal fees, valuation fees, guarantee fees, lenders mortgage insurance where the cost is directly passed on (ie, as a “recharge”), loan procurement fees, survey fees, mortgage brokers’ commissions, costs of arranging overdrafts, and certain expenses relating to debenture issues. Insurance premiums are not deductible under s DB 5. The financial arrangements rules 4. Where borrowing-related expenditure is consideration that is taken into account in calculating income or expenditure under the FA rules, the amount and timing of the expenditure are determined under those rules. Because expenditure under the FA rules is deemed to be interest, whether a deduction is allowable for such expenditure is determined by s DB 6, s DB 7 or s DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2). 5. If a taxpayer is not a cash basis person (see \[37\]) and the FA rules apply to them or if a taxpayer is a cash basis person who is required to use a spreading method because of an election under s EW 61 (see \[38\]), borrowing-related expenditure that may need to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules includes:  the cost of any lenders mortgage insurance that is passed on to the borrower by being incorporated into the interest rate;  loan application fees – unless they are non-contingent fees (see \[34\]) or non- integral fees (see \[35\]);  loan establishment or draw down fees – unless they are non-contingent fees or non-integral fees;  loan procurement fees or broker’s fees – unless they are non-contingent fees or non-integral fees; and  guarantee fees for a guarantee given as security for borrowed money. 6. Cash basis persons are not required to calculate and spread income or expenditure under the FA rules (s EW 13(3)). Therefore, ss DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2) and DB 5 are the relevant provisions for determining deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money by a cash basis person, except in the year in which a base price adjustment is required (see \[46\]). 7. In the year in which a base price adjustment is required (eg, the year in which a loan is repaid), all consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangement comes into the base price adjustment. This includes any expenditure under a loan that has not already been deducted under s DB 5 or s DA 1. This might include, for example, expenditure under a loan incurred in the year of the base 3 price adjustment, and expenditure paid to the lender to discharge a mortgage or to induce a lender to accept early repayment of a loan. 8. A guarantee given for a fee is also a financial arrangement in itself. Therefore, in the final year of the guarantee, a base price adjustment would be required. 9. Any expenditure that is not taken into account and spread under the FA rules or brought into a base price adjustment is potentially deductible under either s DA 1 or s DB 5. Sections DA 1 and DB 5 10. Where borrowed money is a revenue item (see from \[51\]), expenditure incurred in borrowing the money will generally be deductible under s DA 1. 11. Where borrowed money is an addition to capital, expenditure incurred in borrowing the money will not be deductible under s DA 1, because of the capital limitation (s DA 2(1)). However, it may be deductible under s DB 5, which overrides the capital limitation. This item sets out the requirements for expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5. 12. Section DB 5 allows a person a deduction for expenditure incurred “in borrowing money that is used as capital in deriving their income”. For expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5, the:  expenditure must be incurred by the taxpayer;  expenditure must be incurred in borrowing money; and  the taxpayer must use the borrowed money as capital in the derivation of their income. 13. As noted at \[2\], the deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure may potentially need to be determined under subpart DG, if it relates to a mixed-use asset (see further \[57\]). 14. The fact that s DB 5 requires the taxpayer to use the money borrowed as capital in deriving their income means that the taxpayer must actually borrow money for the borrowing-related expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5. Expenditure incurred in unsuccessfully attempting to borrow money is not deductible under s DB 5 (Case L101 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,533; Case Q61 (1983) 83 ATC 319). 15. To be incurred “in borrowing money” the expenditure must be incurred in establishing or setting up the loan (Ure v FCT, 81 ATC 4,100 (FCA)). 16. The expenditure does not need to be incurred at the time of the borrowing. Expenditure “incurred in borrowing money” could include expenditure that is incurred during the life of the loan. This will be the case only when, at the time of and in the course of establishing the borrowing, the borrower enters into an obligation to incur the expenditure during the life of the loan (Ure). This would not extend to expenditure related to bringing the borrowing to an end. 17. Expenditure on items such as interest and the repayment of principal are not deductible under s DB 5 (Ure). 18. Costs incurred in refinancing or “rolling over” a loan may be incurred in establishing a new loan, but it will be a question of fact in each case. For example, an extension of the term of a loan contract, made under a provision in the contract contemplating such an extension, may be a variation of the contract and not the establishment of a new loan (In re Goldstone’s Mortgage \[1916\] NZLR 489; Nelson Diocesan Trust Board v Hamilton \[1926\] NZLR 342 (CA)). 4 Costs incurred in relation to such an extension would not be deductible under s DB 5 because they are not incurred in establishing a loan. 19. Expenditure incurred in repaying borrowed money is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money, so is not deductible under s DB 5 (Riviera Hotel v MNR \[1972\] CTC 157 (FC); Neonex International Ltd v R, 78 DTC 6,339 (FCA); Case 31, 10 CTBR 92). A payment made to induce a lender to accept early repayment is expenditure incurred in repaying borrowed money rather than expenditure incurred in borrowing money, even if it is necessary to incur such expenditure to satisfy a requirement that the replacement lender be given a first charge (Riviera Hotel and Neonex). However, as noted above, such expenditure may come into the base price adjustment that the FA rules require in respect of the loan that is being brought to an end. 20. Similarly, expenditure incurred in discharging a mortgage is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money, whether or not the discharge of the mortgage is required to give security to a replacement lender. Therefore, expenditure incurred in discharging a mortgage is not deductible under s DB 5 (Riviera Hotel and Neonex). 21. The premium on a life insurance policy required by the lender as security for a loan is not deductible under s DA 1 (by virtue of s DA 2(1)) because it is capital expenditure (Case 64, 10 CTBR 189; Equitable Acceptance Corp Ltd v MNR \[1964\] CTC 74; Côté-Reco Ltd v MNR \[1980\] CTC 2,019; Case Y21, 91 ATC 250). Such a premium is also not deductible under s DB 5 because it is expenditure incurred in acquiring an asset or benefit (ie, the rights under the policy) other than the loan. Therefore, it cannot be characterised as being incurred “in borrowing money”. This is the case regardless of the type of life insurance (ie, whole of life, term, mortgage repayment insurance, or otherwise) (Case 19 (1966) 13 CTBR (NS) 124; Case Y21; Equitable Acceptance; Antoine Guertin Ltée v R \[1988\] 1 CTC 117 (FCA); Elirpa Construction & Materials Ltd v Canada \[1995\] 2 CTC 2,968). 22. The passed on cost of lenders mortgage insurance may be deductible under s DB 5, if it is expenditure the borrower is required to incur to obtain a loan. However, this will not be the case where such costs have to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules or are incorporated into the interest rate. In those cases such costs would be deductible under s DB 6, s DB 7 or, if not under those provisions, potentially under s DA 1. 23. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of expenditure that will be deductible under s DB 5. Whether particular expenditure is deductible under s DB 5 depends on whether the expenditure meets the requirements of the section as set out in this statement, whether the expenditure needs to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules, and whether it is expenditure that relates to a mixed-use asset (in which case the deductibility of the expenditure would be determined under subpart DG). Howev er, expenditure that will typically be deductible under s DB 5 (where not required to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules, and where not required to be considered under subpart DG) includes:  legal fees in connection with establishing a loan;  valuation fees, where the lender requires a valuation;  guarantee fees;  the passed-on cost of lenders mortgage insurance (where the cost is passed on to the borrower as a “recharge”);  loan procurement fees; 5  survey fees, where the lender requires the surveying;  mortgage brokers’ commissions;  costs of arranging bank overdrafts; and  certain expenses relating to debenture issues (such as drafting, advertising and printing prospectuses). Statements this Interpretation Statement replaces 24. This Interpretation Statement replaces the item “Deductibility of mortgage repayment insurance taken out to obtain a business loan” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 9 (February 1995). The 1995 item incorrectly states the law in concluding that mortgage repayment insurance would be deductible under the predecessor to s DB 5. 25. It is also noted that there is a PIB item entitled “Life and accident insurance policies” Public Information Bulletin No 106 (July 1980) that is still under consideration as part of Inland Revenue’s review of PIBs. PIB items still under consideration should be referenced with some care, and should not necessarily be taken as the Commissioner’s current view of the law or operational practice. The item “Life and accident insurance policies” considers the deductibility of life and accident insurance premiums in an employment context. The PIB item could potentially be interpreted more generally in relation to the deductibility of insurance premiums. To the extent that interpreting it that way would make it inconsistent with this Interpretation Statement, the PIB item is overtaken by this item. Introduction 26. Borrowing-related expenditure may be deductible under the FA rules, under s DA 1 (the general deductibility provision), or under s DB 5 (which provides for the deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money for use as capital in deriving income). This Interpretation Statement is primarily about the application of s DB 5, but it also identifies when borrowing-related expenditure could be deductible under the FA rules or under s DA 1, rather than under s DB 5. This statement does not consider the application of the FA rules to borrowing-related expenditure that would not otherwise potentially be deductible under s DB 5. 27. This statement considers the deductibility of premiums for insurance required by a lender as security for a borrowing, because there is conflicting case law on this issue. Also, the Commissioner understands that some taxpayers may have treated term life insurance premiums as deductible under s DB 5. The discussion of the deductibility of premiums for insurance required by a lender as security for a borrowing starts from \[122\]. This statement does not consider the deductibility of premiums for insurance that is not required by a lender as security for a borrowing. Analysis 28. The following flowchart illustrates the approach set out in this Interpretation Statement to determining the deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure: 6 Deduct the  expenditure  under s DA 1.  Take the  expenditure  into account  under the FA  rules.  No No Yes  Yes  Yes  Does the expenditure need to be taken into account under the FA rules? If a taxpayer must use a spreading method under the FA rules, borrowing‐related costs would need to be  taken into account and spread, if the costs are consideration paid or payable for or under a financial  arrangement, unless they are:   non‐contingent fees (unless the relevant spreading method is the IF RS financial reporting method  in s EW 15D); or   non‐integral fees (unless the relevant spreading method is the IFRS financial reporting method in  s EW 15D or the modified fair value method in s EW 15G).  Whether or not a taxpayer must use a spreading method, some borrowing‐related expenditure may need  to be brought into the base price adjustment calculation (eg, when the loan comes to an end).  This might  include, for example, expenditure under the loan incurred in the year of the base price adjustment,  exp enditure paid to the lender to discharge a mortgage, and early repayment fees.  Is the expenditure deductible under s DA 1? If borrowed money is a revenue item (ie, it is borrowed to acquire trading stock or for on‐lending in the  ordinary course of the business), expenditure related to the borrowing might be deductible under s DA 1.   It would need to:   meet the general permission (nexus with income); and   no t be denied deductibility by any of the general limitations.  Is the expenditure deductible under s DB 5?  For expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5, it must:   meet the general permission (nexus with income);   not be denied deductibility by any of the general limitations, aside from the capital limitation,  which s DB 5 overrides;   be “incurred” by the taxpayer;   be incurred “in borrowing mone y”, which requires that:   ◦ money must be borrowed;  ◦ the expenditure must be incurred in relation to establishing the borrowing     (In relation to this requirement, the expenditure could be expenditure that is incurred during the  life of the loan.  This will be the case only when, at the time of and in th e course of establishing  the borrowing, the borrower enters into an obligation to incur the expenditure during the life of  the loan.  However, this would not extend to expenditure related to bringing the borrowing to an  end);  ◦ the expenditure must have sufficient nexus with the borrowing, including by:   - be ing required by the lender in order for the borrower to obtain the borrowing;  - being relevant to and related to the borrowing; and  - not resulting in the acquisition of more than minor assets or benefits other than the  borrowing;   be incurred in borrowing money that the taxpayer use s as capital in the derivation of their income;  and   not be expenditure to which subpart DG (which relates to mixed‐use assets) applies.  Deduct the  expenditure  under s DB 5.  7 Deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure under the financial arrangements rules 29. The FA rules override any other provision relating to the timing or quantification of income or expenditure under a financial arrangement, unless the other provision expressly or by necessary implication requires otherwise (s EW 2). Therefore, in considering the deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure it is necessary to first consider whether the FA rules apply. 30. Neither s DA 1 nor s DB 5 expressly exclude the application of the FA rules, and those provisions do not deal explicitly with the quantification or timing of expenditure incurred in borrowing money. Therefore, ss DA 1 and DB 5 do not by necessary implication exclude the application of the FA rules. 31. Accordingly, where borrowing-related expenditure is consideration taken into account in calculating income or expenditure under the FA rules, the amount and timing of the recognition of any such income or expenditure is determined by the FA rules. Because expenditure under the FA rules is interest as defined, whether a deduction is allowable for such expenditure is determined by s DB 6, s DB 7, or s DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2). 32. Where a person is required to use a spreading method under the FA rules, s EW 15(1) provides that the calculation and allocation of income and expenditure under the financial arrangement must include:  all consideration paid or payable for or under the financial arrangement except for: - non-contingent fees (unless the relevant spreading method is the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D); and - non-integral fees (unless the relevant spreading method is the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D or the modified fair value method in s EW 15G); and  amounts that have been or will be remitted by the person under the financial arrangement; and  amounts that would have been payable to the person under the financial arrangement if those amounts had not been remitted by law. 33. Some borrowing-related expenditure that is “for or under” a financial arrangement may be non-contingent or non-integral fees, and therefore not come under the FA rules. 34. A non-contingent fee (defined in s YA 1) is a fee for services provided for a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement, and is payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds. 35. A non-integral fee (defined in s YA 1) is a fee or transaction cost that is not an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial arrangement for the purposes of financial reporting under IFRS. 36. As non-contingent fees and non-integral fees paid or payable for or under a financial arrangement are not taken into account in calculating income or expenditure under the FA rules, whether such fees are deductible is to be determined under s DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2) or s DB 5. Non cash basis persons and cash basis persons applying a spreading method 37. A person will be a cash basis person for an income year if the value of financial arrangements to which they are a party does not exceed the prescribed thresholds in s EW 57(1)–(3) (s EW 54). If those thresholds are exceeded, the 8 person will not be a cash basis person. If the FA rules apply to them (s EW 9), they must calculate and spread income or expenditure under the FA rules for any financial arrangement they are a party to. 38. A cash basis person is not required to apply any of the spreading methods under the FA rules to their financial arrangements, but may choose to do so under s EW 61 (ss EW 13(3) and EW 55(1)). If a cash basis person elects to use a spreading method, they must use a spreading method for all financial arrangements they are a party to at the time of making the election, and all financial arrangements they enter into after the income year in which they make the election, until any revocation of their election is effective (s EW 61). 39. A loan is a financial arrangement (s EW 3). Therefore, if a taxpayer is not a cash basis person and the FA rules apply to them, or if they are a cash basis person who has elected to use a spreading method, any consideration for or under the loan would be taken into account and spread under the FA rules. This might include, for example:  the cost of any lenders mortgage insurance that the lender passes on to the borrower;  loan application fees (unless they are non-contingent fees or non-integral fees);  loan establishment or draw down fees (unless they are non-contingent fees or non-integral fees, though they are probably unlikely to be so);  Loan procurement fees or broker’s fees (unless they are non-contingent or non-integral fees, though they are probably unlikely to be so). 40. An extension of the term or amount of a loan contract or an alteration to the interest rate that is made under a provision in the contract contemplating such an extension or alteration may amount to a variation of the contract and not the establishment of a new loan. In this situation, if the taxpayer is required to use a spreading method, Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement may need to be applied. If this is the case, any loan variation fees would be included in the adjustment made under that determination in the year of the variation. 41. Other borrowing-related expenditure that would need to be calculated and spread under the FA rules would include any fees for a guarantee that is provided as security for borrowed money. This is because a guarantee given for a fee is a financial arrangement. 42. If the lender requires the borrower to take out insurance as security for the loan, it is unlikely that the loan and insurance contracts would be considered to be together part of a wider or composite financial arrangement. Where the insurance contract is not part of a wider financial arrangement, the premiums payable are not taken into account under the FA rules, because the insurance contract is an excepted financial arrangement (s EW 5(8)). 43. However, there may be circumstances where an insurance contract is part of a wider financial arrangement. Where this is the case, the premium would fall outside the FA rules to the extent that it was solely attributable to the insurance contract (which typically it would be in its entirety). 44. It is unlikely that there would be any other expenditure incurred in borrowing money that would be incurred for or under the loan or for or under another financial arrangement. However, if other expenditure were incurred for or under a financial arrangement, it would need to be taken into account under the FA rules. The deductibility of all other expenditure incurred in borrowing money 9 would be determined under s DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2) or s DB 5 (which requires that the general permission be satisfied, but overrides the capital limitation). Cash basis persons not applying a spreading method 45. Cash basis persons (see \[37\]) are not required to calculate and spread income or expenditure under the FA rules (s EW 13(3)). Therefore, ss DA 1 (in conjunction with the limitations in s DA 2) and DB 5 are the relevant provisions for determining deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money by a cash basis person, except in the year in which a base price adjustment is required (ss EW 28 – EW 31). 46. A base price adjustment is a wash-up calculation that a party to a financial arrangement must perform in the year that any of the events specified in s EW 29 occur (unless s EW 30 applies). For example, a base price adjustment is required on the maturity or disposal of a financial arrangement, on the absolute assignment of the party’s rights or legal defeasance of the party’s obligations under the financial arrangement, or on a party to a financial arrangement ceasing to be a New Zealand resident. 47. In the year in which a base price adjustment is required, all consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangement would be included in the base price adjustment. This would include any consideration for or under the loan that has not already been deductible expenditure under s DA 1 or s DB 5, for example, expenditure incurred under the loan in the year of the base price adjustment, and “break fees” payable on early repayment of the loan if those fees are payable under a financial arrangement. Deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure under section DA 1 48. Borrowing-related expenditure may be deductible under the general deductibility provision, s DA 1(1). Section DA 1(1) and (2) provide that: DA 1 General permission Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. 49. Provided that none of the general limitations in s DA 2 apply, a deduction is allowed under s DA 1 for an amount of expenditure or loss incurred in the course of deriving assessable income, excluded income or a combination of assessable income and excluded income, or in the course of carrying on a business for such purposes. One of the limitations in s DA 2 that overrides s DA 1 is the capital 10 limitation (s DA 2(1)). The capital limitation ensures that no deduction is allowable under s DA 1 for expenditure of a capital nature. 50. Generally, borrowed money is regarded as an addition to capital (Caltex Ltd v FCT (1960) 106 CLR 205; Davies v The Shell Company of China Ltd (1950–1952) 32 TC 133 (CA); Public Trustee v Commissioner of Taxes \[1938\] NZLR 436). Expenditure incurred to obtain borrowed money that is an addition to capital is capital expenditure (Texas Land & Mortgage Co v Holtam (1894) 3 TC 255). 51. However, in some circumstances borrowed money is a revenue item (Scottish North American Trust Ltd v Farm (1903–1911) 5 TC 693; Texas Co (Australasia) Ltd v FCT (1940) 63 CLR 382; Canada Permanent Mortgage Corp v MNR \[1971\] CTC 694; AVCO Financial Services Ltd v FCT, 82 ATC 4,246 (HCA); Coles Myer Finance Ltd v FCT, 93 ATC 4,214 (HCA)). 52. Whether borrowed money is capital or revenue depends on the purpose for which the money is borrowed. If money is borrowed to acquire trading stock or is borrowed for on-lending in the ordinary course of the business (ie, by a taxpayer who is in the business of lending money), the borrowed money is revenue in nature. 53. Where borrowed money is a revenue item, borrowing-related expenditure may be deductible under s DA 1. Where borrowed money is an addition to capital, borrowing-related expenditure will generally not be deductible under s DA 1, because of the capital limitation (s DA 2(1)). 54. If loan variation fees do not need to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules, they may be deductible under s DA 1. This would be the case, for example, if the fee is payable in order for the borrower to get out of a fixed interest rate early, and so save on interest that would itself have been deductible if incurred. Deductibility of borrowing-related expenditure under section DB 5 55. Capital expenditure incurred in borrowing money may be deductible under s DB 5, which states: DB 5 Transaction costs: borrowing money for use as capital Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in borrowing money that is used as capital in deriving their income. Relationship with subpart DG (1B) Subpart DG (Expenditure related to use of certain assets) overrides this section for expenditure to which that subpart relates. Link with subpart DA (2) This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 56. Section DB 5(2) states that s DB 5 overrides the capital limitation. Therefore, a deduction for expenditure associated with borrowing money that would not otherwise have been allowable because it is capital expenditure may be permitted under s DB 5. However, for a deduction to be allowable under s DB 5, the test in s DA 1 must still be satisfied (ie, a relationship must exist between the borrowing- related expenditure and the income-earning process) (s DB 5(2)). Therefore, s DB 5 modifies the general deductibility rule by permitting a deduction for expenditure incurred in borrowing money that is expenditure of a capital nature, but does not override s DA 1. 11 57. Where expenditure relates to borrowing used to purchase a mixed-use asset, the deductibility of that expenditure may need to be determined under subpart DG, which overrides s DB 5 for expenditure to which that subpart relates (s DB 5(1B)). Subpart DG sets out the rules for the deductibility and apportionment of expenditure incurred for an income year in relation to an asset when the asset is used partly for income-earning purposes and partly for private purposes, and for a time during the income year, the asset is not in use (s DG 1). 58. For expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5:  the expenditure must be “incurred” by the taxpayer (see \[59\]–\[60\]);  the expenditure must be incurred “in borrowing money” (see \[69\]–\[171\]); and  the borrowed money must be used by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of their income (see \[172\]–\[177\]). Expenditure must be “incurred” by the taxpayer 59. Section DB 5 requires that the expenditure be incurred by the taxpayer in borrowing money. 60. The meaning of “incurred” has been considered in the context of an Australian provision equivalent to s DB 5 (in Ure), and in the context of the predecessors to s DB 5 (in Felt and Textiles v CIR \[1969\] NZLR 493 and King v CIR \[1974\] 2 NZLR 190). 61. In Felt, the objector issued debentures to the public at a discount of 1%. The objector claimed that the discount was deductible under s 121 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (a predecessor to s DB 5) as expenditure incurred in the borrowing of money used by the objector as capital in the production of assessable income. 62. The Supreme Court held that the issuing of debentures at a 1% discount (and therefore the obligation incurred to pay an additional £1 per debenture at maturity, after 15 years) did not involve an expenditure in borrowing money. McGregor J considered there was no expenditure because nothing was actually disbursed, saying at 499: I cannot appreciate how the agreement to pay the additional sum on the maturity of the debenture can be regarded as an expenditure incurred by the taxpayer. The words of Kekewich J. in Re Bristol \[1893\] 3 Ch. 161 are somewhat apt: “ ‘Expenditure’: What do you expend? You expend that which you have. In common parlance you say that a man has spent more than his income. That is common parlance, but that is not language which you would suppose the Legislature to use. A man cannot spend what he has not got; he can mortgage or pledge, but he cannot actually spend”. 63. The reasoning of the court in Felt was considered in King. In King, the Supreme Court considered whether contributions that mortgagors borrowing from the State Advances Corporation were required to make to the General Reserve Fund were deductible when the loan money was used in the production of assessable income. 64. The Commissioner, following the approach taken by McGregor J in Felt, denied that these contributions were expenditure incurred by the taxpayers, since the taxpayers had never had the money (the taxpayers elected to have the amount of the contributions added to the loan and secured by the mortgage). However, Wild CJ felt that “expenditure” could not be construed so narrowly, commenting at 195: “Expenditure” is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as “the amount expended from time to time”, and the meaning of “expend” is given as “to pay away, lay out, spend”. In the New Zealand section the word “expenditure” is linked with the word “incurred”, as is the phrase 12 “losses or outgoings” in the Australian legislation. For that reason, notwithstanding the citation made by McGregor J. from Kekewich J., I think the reasoning of the High Court should be applied to the construction of sec. 121. Accordingly I think that a deduction may be allowed under that section in respect of “expenditure incurred” although there has been no actual disbursement if, in the relevant income year, the taxpayer is definitively committed to that expenditure. In this case the objectors were so committed. 65. The court held that a deduction may be allowed under s 121 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 in respect of “expenditure incurred” although there has been no actual disbursement, if in the relevant income year (here the year of borrowing) the taxpayer is definitively committed to the expenditure. As support for this proposition the court referred to New Zealand Flax Investments Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 179 and FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd (1953) 88 CLR 492. 66. The Court of Appeal in CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA) approved the approach of the court in King. The court in Banks considered the issue of when expenditure is incurred in the context of s 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (a predecessor to s DA 1). The court cited King and James Flood as authority for the proposition that expenditure is incurred when the taxpayer is definitively committed to the expenditure for which the deduction is sought. 67. In Ure, the majority of the Australian Federal Court took a similar view of the meaning of “incurred” in the context of s 67 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1976 (Cth), stating at 4,113: In our view, it is unlikely that it was the legislative intent that the deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing should be governed by reference to whether actual payment was made or due at the time of the loan. It seems to us to be preferable to interpret the reference to expenditure incurred in borrowing as including payment to be made during the life of the loan pursuant to a contractual obligation which was incurred at the time of borrowing as an incident of establishing the loan. 68. The most significant New Zealand authority on the meaning of the term “incurred” is the Privy Council decision of CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351. None of the decisions discussed above are inconsistent with Mitsubishi. Expenditure must be incurred “in borrowing money” 69. To be deductible under s DB 5, the expenditure must be incurred “in borrowing money”. 70. For expenditure to be incurred “in borrowing money” for the purposes of s DB 5:  money must be borrowed (see \[71\] – \[75\]);  the expenditure must be incurred in relation to establishing the borrowing (see \[76\] – \[117\]) \[In relation to this requirement, the expenditure could be expenditure that is incurred during the life of the loan. This will be the case only when, at the time of and in the course of establishing the borrowing, the borrower enters into an obligation to incur the expenditure during the life of the loan (eg, the guarantee fees in Ure). However this would not extend to expenditure related to bringing the borrowing to an end\]; and  the expenditure must have sufficient nexus with the borrowing (see \[118\] – \[171\]), including by: - being required by the lender in order for the borrower to obtain the borrowing; - being relevant to and related to the borrowing; and - not resulting in the acquisition of more than minor assets or benefits other than the borrowing. 13 Money must be borrowed 71. Section DB 5 requires the taxpayer to use the money borrowed as capital in deriving their income. It is clear from this requirement that the taxpayer must actually borrow money before the borrowing-related expenditure can be deductible under s DB 5. A taxpayer cannot use borrowed money as capital in deriving income unless the taxpayer actually borrows the money. 72. If expenses are incurred in attempting to borrow money, and the borrowing does not proceed, no deduction is allowed. Case L101 supports this view. In that case, the taxpayer claimed a deduction for travel expenses incurred in travelling to Australia to put in an offer on a commercial property that had been found on a previous trip and to arrange finance for the purchase. The finance was arranged through a finance company, which borrowed money offshore. The offer to purchase the property was unsuccessful. 73. The taxpayer claimed that the expenses of the trip were deductible under s 136 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (a predecessor to s DB 5). One reason for the Taxation Review Authority’s finding in Case L101 that the expenditure was not deductible was that s 136 did not apply because no money was borrowed. 74. The decision in Case L101 is consistent with the decision in Case Q61, in respect of an equivalent Australian legislative provision. 75. The money received must also be “borrowed” money. For example, a company that incurs expenditure in issuing shares to the public will receive money. However, because that money is not “borrowed”, the expenditure is not deductible under s DB 5. Money subscribed for shares is not borrowed money. The amount represented by the shares does not represent money lent by the shareholders to the company. Such shares are capital of the company, not a debt between the shareholder and the company (Case 40 (1958) 8 CTBR (NS) 196). Expenditure must be incurred in establishing the borrowing 76. The scope of the phrase “in borrowing money” is open to different interpretations. However, in light of the apparent purpose of s DB 5, the Commissioner considers that “in borrowing money” means that the expenditure in question must be incurred in establishing or setting up the loan in order for the expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5. Section 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 77. Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 provides that the meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose (see also Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36; \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767). Therefore, it is necessary to determine the ordinary meaning or meanings of the words “in borrowing money”, and then to cross- check the meaning or meanings against the purpose of s DB 5. 78. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) defines the word “in” (relevantly) as: In prep. 1 expressing the situation of being enclosed or surrounded by something. 2 expressing motion that results in being within or surrounded by something. 3 expressing a period of time during which an event happens or a situation remains the case. 4 expressing the length of time before a future event is expected to happen. 5 expressing a state, condition, or quality. 6 expressing inclusion or involvement. ... \[Emphasis added\] 14 79. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the word “borrow” (relevantly) as: borrow v. 1 take and use (something belonging to someone else) with the intention of returning it. ● take and use (money) from a person or bank under agreement to pay it back later. ... 80. The text in s DB 5 could be given two different interpretations in terms of the meaning of the phrase “in borrowing money”, because “borrowing” has two potential meanings. 81. The first possible interpretation is that because the ordinary meaning of “in” can express a period of time during which a situation remains the case, and the ordinary meaning of “borrow” being to take and use money under agreement to pay it back later, the phrase “in borrowing money” can encompass the entire on- going process or transaction of borrowing money. That is, that the phrase can refer to expenditure incurred in the course of the borrowing of the money, rather than just in the course of establishing the borrowing. 82. The second possible interpretation is that because the ordinary meaning of “in” can express a period of time during which an event happens, the phrase “in borrowing money” could refer only to the process of getting or obtaining the loan (ie, establishing the borrowing). 83. As noted above, s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes it necessary to cross- check the meaning of the legislative text against its purpose (see also Fonterra). 84. The history of s DB 5 provides some insight into the intended scope of the provision. The provision was originally enacted as s 15 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1939 (which was deemed part of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923), which read: 15. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section eighty of the principal Act, the Commissioner may, in calculating the assessable income of any taxpayer, allow such deduction as he thinks fit in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during the income year for the preparation, stamping, and registration of any lease of property used in the production of his assessable income, or of any renewal of any such lease, or in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the production of assessable income. 85. During the second reading of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill 1939, the Minister of Finance, the Hon. Mr Nash, explained the purpose of the provision as follows (see NZPD Vol 256, 537): Clause 15 gives a taxpayer the right to deduct from assessable income in arriving at his taxable income the legal expenses associated with a mortgage. There has been quite a lot of injustice through the lack of a provision of this nature. A taxpayer might incur in the renewal of a mortgage on property used in the production of the income an expense of from £20 to £30, and yet under the existing law has no right to deduct that expense from the assessable income. 86. These comments arguably suggest that the provision was aimed at providing deductions for expenses in raising money on mortgage (though in relation to borrowing costs it was not limited to the specific establishment costs listed in the provision in relation to leases). 87. The wording of the original provision is slightly different to the current wording of s DB 5. The original provision referred to expenditure incurred “in the borrowing of money”, whereas s DB 5 refers to expenditure incurred “in borrowing money”. It could be suggested that the “the” indicates that the provision was meant to apply in respect of expenditure incurred at any point in the course of the borrowing. However, the Commissioner considers that it is more strongly arguable that the word “the” indicates that the provision was meant to apply in respect of expenditure incurred in the course of the establishment of the borrowing. 15 88. The provision remained in essentially its original form until the Income Tax Act 2004, when the reference to the preparation, stamping, registration and renewal of leases of property was separated out into a new provision (now s DB 18), and the provision took on its current form. 89. Although the deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money was not restricted to specific items of expenditure (as it was for expenditure relating to leases of property), the Commissioner considers that the scheme of the provision suggests that the intended scope was expenditure associated with the establishment of a lease or borrowing. 90. It is acknowledged that very little can be drawn from the pre-legislative material as to the intended purpose of what is now s DB 5. However the Commissioner considers that the provision appears to have been primarily aimed at allowing for the deductibility of expenses associated with obtaining borrowed money, rather than for the deductibility of any borrowing-related expenses. 91. On the basis of the above, the text in s DB 5 could be given two different interpretations in terms of the meaning of the phrase “in borrowing money”. Those words could be interpreted as referring to the entire on-going process of borrowing money or as referring only to the process of obtaining a borrowing. When those words are considered in light of what appears to have been the purpose of s DB 5, the Commissioner considers that the words “in borrowing money” in s DB 5 refer to expenditure related to the process of obtaining the borrowing (ie, in establishing the loan). Case law 92. There is little New Zealand case law on s DB 5 or its predecessors. The only New Zealand case that touched on the provision (when it was s 136 of the Income Tax Act 1976) is Case G50 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,212. In Case G50 Judge Barber considered that the fees and disbursements in question would fall within either the general deductibility provision or alternatively the equivalent of s DB 5. However, the Commissioner considers that Case G50 does not provide any guidance on the meaning of the words “in borrowing money” or the provision more generally 1 (see further from \[112\]). 93. The Australian Federal Court decision of Ure is considered the leading case on a similar provision, namely s 67(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1976 (Cth), which provided that: Subject to this section, so much of the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in borrowing money used by him for the purpose of producing assessable income as bears to the whole of that expenditure the same proportion as the part of the period for which the money was borrowed that is in the year of income bears to the whole of that period shall be an allowable deduction. 94. Section 67(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1976 (Cth) was not identical to s DB 5, as it expressly provided for apportionment. However, the court still had to consider the meaning of the phrase “in borrowing money”, and the Commissioner considers that Ure is relevant authority as to the meaning of that phrase in s DB 5. 95. In Ure, the Federal Court of Australia drew a distinction between what it called the cost of borrowing money and the cost of the money. The court held that the 1 Case G50 is discussed from \[112\]. As noted at \[113\], in Case G50, the Commissioner conceded that the fees and disbursements were revenue expenditure. It is unclear why this concession was made, and the Commissioner considers that the finding in Case G50 (at least in respect of the general deductibility provision) appears to be based on this concession. Judge Barber’s comments on s 136 of the Income Tax Act 1976 were obiter, and there is no reasoning in the case to support them. For these reasons, the Commissioner does not consider Case G50 to be good authority for the deductibility of mortgage discharge fees under s DB 5. 16 taxpayer was entitled to a deduction under s 67(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1976 (Cth) for an appropriate proportion of valuation fees and legal costs associated with the borrowing. The majority of the court (Deane and Sheppard JJ) said at 4,112: The words “expenditure incurred ... in borrowing money” in the context of sec. 67(1) of the Act, refer in our view, to the “cost” of the borrowing as distinct from the “cost” of the money. The expenditure on account of legal expenses and valuation fees was plainly a “cost” of the borrowing: it was incurred in relation to the actual establishment of the relevant loan. On the other hand, interest payable to the lender represented a “cost” of the money: it was the price payable to the lender for the use of the money lent. The legal expenses and valuation fees were, and the interest was not, “expenditure incurred ... in borrowing money” for the purposes of sec. 67(1). 96. The court considered that the legislative provision in question (equivalent to s DB 5) allowed a deduction only for expenditure incurred in establishing or setting up the loan (which was the cost of the borrowing), not expenditure arising from the borrowed money itself (which was the cost of the money). 97. Expenditure on items such as interest and the repayment of principal are not deductible under s DB 5. Although the repayment of money is linked to the borrowing of money (borrowing necessarily implies repayment at some time), the expenditure relates to the loan itself, not to the establishment or setting up of the loan. 98. The Commissioner considers that Ure is authority for expenditure incurred “in borrowing money” being expenditure incurred in establishing or setting up the loan. However, the expenditure does not need to be incurred at the time of the borrowing. Expenditure “incurred in borrowing money” could include expenditure incurred during the life of the loan. This will be the case only when at the time of and in the course of establishing the borrowing the borrower enters into an obligation to incur the expenditure during the life of the loan. For example, in Ure it was held that guarantee fees payable on an annual basis over the term of the loan were deductible, because the contractual obligation to pay them arose at the time of, and as an incident of, establishing the loan. That said, loan-related expenditure that is incurred during the life of the loan under a contractual obligation arising at the time of the establishment of the loan would not be incurred “in borrowing money” if it relates to bringing the borrowing to an end (see from \[107\]). It is not sufficient that the expenditure arises under the original loan contract; the character of the expenditure must also be considered. Costs incurred in refinancing or rolling over an existing loan contract 99. Section DB 5 permits deductions for expenditure incurred in establishing a borrowing. Therefore, it may be necessary to consider whether variations or extensions to existing borrowings result in the rescission of the original loan contract and the establishment of a new one or whether they operate simply as variations. If there is a rescission of the original loan and the establishment of a new one, associated expenditure will potentially be deductible under s DB 5. But if there is simply a variation of the existing loan, associated expenditure will not be deductible under s DB 5 as it will not relate to the establishment of the loan. 100. Costs incurred in refinancing or rolling over a loan may, effectively, be incurred in establishing a new loan. As a matter of contract law, a variation of a loan may or may not create a new contract. The Court of Appeal discussed this principle in Goldstone at 502: It may be here observed that to call any such transaction as we have described a variation of the original mortgage would in popular language be correct, but in law and in truth the alteration made by the new instrument is a new contract compounded of the terms of the old and the new instrument. 17 101. The Court of Appeal applied Goldstone in Nelson in which the term of a mortgage had been extended by the execution of a memorandum. However, in Robt Jones Investments Ltd v Instrument Supplies Ltd (1991) NZ ConvC 190,746 at 190,752, the High Court considered Nelson was not relevant where: The variation of Lease was to give effect to the rent fixing provisions in the Lease during the term of the Lease and nothing was being done to vary the Lease outside the terms contemplated by the Lease. 102. In Robt Jones the court cited Baker v Merckell \[1960\] 1 All ER 668 (CA), one of several English cases concerning leases of land. In Baker, a lease had been granted for a term of seven years from 1 November 1946. In 1949, a deed was endorsed on the lease witnessing the parties’ agreement that the term should be extended for a further term of four years at the option of the tenant. Pearce LJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, applied the dictum of Maugham J in In re Savile Settled Estates \[1931\] 2 Ch 210 at 217: An alteration of an existing lease, so that it will operate for a term extending beyond the original term, can operate in law only as a surrender of the old lease and a grant of a new one. 103. Pearce LJ said at 672: Although the implication of surrender and fresh grant is a fiction based on estoppel, and, as Clauson J said ... it is not to be encouraged or extended, it is not easy on the authorities to avoid the implication of a surrender and fresh grant where such a change is made in the term, viz., a variation of a term of seven years to a term of seven years with an option for a further four years. 104. It follows from this Court of Appeal authority (Goldstone and Nelson) that a new loan contract comes into existence on the refinancing or rolling over of an old loan. Therefore, the costs incurred in the refinancing or rolling over of a loan may be incurred “in borrowing money”. This will be the case where the costs relate to the establishment of the new borrowing, but not where the costs relate to bringing the old borrowing to an end (ie, break fees). 105. However, another line of cases may lead to a contrary result. These cases began with Morris v Baron & Co \[1918\] AC 1 (HL). In Morris, the House of Lords decided that whether a contract is discharged depends on the extent to which the parties intended to alter their existing contractual relations. The intention may be merely to vary or modify the terms of the prior contract without altering them in substance, or it may be to extinguish the former contract and substitute a new one. The intention to extinguish and substitute may be inferred from the second agreement being inconsistent with the first to an extent that goes to the very root of it. 106. It seems likely that refinancing or rolling over a loan will evidence an intention to extinguish the old contract and substitute a new one, as an extension of the term of a contract goes to the root of the contract (Baker). This would mean that expenditure incurred in relation to the refinancing or rollover may be deductible under s DB 5. However, it will be a question of fact in each case. For example, an extension of the term of a loan contract, made pursuant to a provision in the contract contemplating such an extension, is a variation of the contract and is not the establishment of a new loan. Expenditure incurred in relation to a variation would not be deductible under s DB 5. Expenditure relating to bringing borrowing to an end is not incurred “in borrowing money” 107. Several cases support the view that expenditure incurred in bringing a borrowing to an end is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money (Riviera Hotel; Neonex; Case 31). 18 108. Riviera Hotel concerned a company that was required to discharge an existing first mortgage to borrow additional capital. As the existing mortgage did not allow prepayment, the company was required to pay six months’ bonus interest under the existing mortgage to secure the discharge of the mortgage. The Canadian Federal Court considered that the bonus interest was not paid for the use of money, so it was not interest. The court held that the bonus interest was an inducement to the existing lender to forego its right to hold the mortgage to maturity and to accept repayment. The bonus interest was an expense incurred in the course of repaying money to the first lender rather than an expense incurred in the course of borrowing money from the second lender. Therefore, the bonus interest was not deductible under the Canadian legislative provision (equivalent to s DB 5(1)). Cattanach J stated at 161: Reverting to the facts in this appeal it is significant to recall that there were two different and distinct borrowings. The appellant sought to obtain further funds from the first lender. Under the mortgage held by the first lender principal and interest remained unpaid and the mortgage contained no provision for prepayment to the first lender. The appellant, having made the commercial decision to expand its hotel facilities by which it expected to earn still further money from its business, was compelled to seek the further necessary funds from another source. This the appellant succeeded in doing but subject to the second lender having a first charge on the appellant’s premises. To meet this condition required by the second lender the appellant was compelled to pay all arrears of principal and interest and in addition was obliged to pay to the first lender the sum of $13,108.27 as a bonus, computed by the yardstick of the equivalent of interest for six months, for the privilege of discharging the mortgage before maturity. ... The payment of $13,108.27 by the appellant to the first lender was not a payment for the use of the money obtained from the first lender. This payment was made to the first lender as an inducement or bonus for the first lender to forego its right to hold its first mortgage to maturity and to accord to the appellant the privilege of paying the balance of principal and interest under the mortgage, which it was the appellant’s obligation to do ultimately, prior to the due dates. The payment of the sum of $13,108.27 was an expense incurred for this purpose. The payment was not made in the course of borrowing money from the first lender but it was made in the course of repaying that money. This being so it follows that the payment to the first lender cannot be construed as an expense incurred by the appellant in the course of borrowing money from the second lender. \[Emphasis added\] 109. In Neonex, a company paid a prepayment bonus to obtain a lender’s consent to the early repayment of a loan. The repayment of the existing loan was a condition of a replacement loan from another lender. The Canadian Federal Court of Appeal considered that the payment was not deductible because it was an expense incurred to rid itself of the first lender, rather than an expense incurred in borrowing money from the second lender: It seems to me that the facts of this case more closely resemble the factual situation in the Riviera case than those in the Yonge-Eglinton case. The reasoning of Cattanach J. appears to me to be clearly right on the facts as he found them which facts are, as observed, closely similar to those in this case. In my view, the payment of $105,000 paid by the Appellant, while in a sense necessary for the fulfillment of a condition imposed in respect of a second borrowing is more properly characterized as a bonus paid to induce the first lender, Prudential Insurance Company of America, to forego its right to hold its first mortgage to maturity by permitting the mortgagor, the Appellant herein, to prepay it. Thus, it cannot be construed as an expense incurred by the Appellant in the course of borrowing money from Marine-Midland, the second lender. It was an expense incurred to rid itself of the first lender. 110. However, early repayment fees or “break fees” may come into the base price adjustment calculation required under the FA rules. See Deductibility of Break Fee Paid by a Landlord to Exit Early from a Fixed Interest Rate Loan (BR Pub 12/01) and Deductibility of Break Fee Paid by a Landlord to Exit Early from a Fixed Interest Rate Loan on Sale of Rental Property (BR Pub 12/03). 111. In Case 31, the Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review considered that a payment made to obtain a mortgagee’s agreement to the early repayment 19 of the mortgage was not deductible under s 67 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1941 (Cth) (equivalent to s DB 5). This was because s 67 did not apply to expenditure incurred in the repayment of borrowed money. 112. In Case G50 the Commissioner conceded that legal fees and disbursements relating to the discharge of mortgages were revenue expenditure. Judge Barber considered that the fees and disbursements were deductible under ss 104 and 136 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (predecessors to s DA 1 and s DB 5(1) respectively). Judge Barber said at 1,215: ... The relevant portion of sec 136 gives a discretion to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred by the taxpayer during the income year in question “in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the production of assessable income” ... I understood Mr McGuire to concede that the said $197, fees and disbursements on the discharge of mortgages to achieve the sale, is deductible as a revenue expense. In any case I find the $197 to be deductible as coming within the words I have quoted from sec 136 of the Act and as generally coming within sec 104. The mortgage loan had provided O with a capital asset, the stud farm, on which to carry out its breeding business. The $197 fee could not come within sec 106(1)(h)(i) because it does not comprise interest. 113. It is unclear why it was conceded that fees and disbursements on the discharge of the mortgages were revenue expenditure, and the Commissioner considers that the finding in Case G50 (at least in respect of the general deductibility provision) appears to be based on this concession. Judge Barber’s comments that the fees and disbursements would be deductible under s 136 were obiter, there is no reasoning in the case to support this view, and Case G50 is inconsistent with the case law outlined above. The Commissioner does not consider Case G50 to be correct in this regard, and for the above reasons does not regard it as good authority for the deductibility of mortgage discharge fees under s DB 5. 114. Expenditure incurred in discharging a mortgage is not a cost of obtaining a loan, and is unlikely to be expenditure incurred under a definitive contractual obligation entered into in connection with the establishment of a loan. In any event, even if mortgage discharge costs were incurred under a definitive contractual obligation entered into in connection with the establishment of a loan, having a mortgage discharged is so intrinsically related to bringing a borrowing to an end that the Commissioner considers those costs cannot rightly be characterised as incurred “in borrowing money”. Expenditure incurred in discharging a mortgage is incurred to terminate the interest of the mortgagee in the land over which the mortgage is secured. Laws of New Zealand Mortgages (online ed, accessed 5 August 2013) at \[295\] and \[296\] states: A mortgage consists of two parts: the contract and the charge. Strictly speaking, the term “release” refers to the termination of the contract, while “discharge” refers to the termination of the charge. The terms are not synonymous. A debt may be released or repaid but a registered charge still remain on the land, at least until action is taken to remove it; and the charge may be discharged, without the debt being released, in which case the debt becomes unsecured. ... A registered mortgage is discharged, wholly or partly, by a mortgage discharge instrument executed by the mortgagee, discharging the whole or part of the land or estate or interest from payment of the whole or part of the principal sum. Before it is registered, a mortgage discharge instrument in paper form operates as a deed inter partes; but it does not affect the legal title until registered. The form must be modified if it is desired to retain the personal covenant. It is not effective to discharge the security until it is registered. If it is not registered, the security remains for the benefit of the person entitled. The discharge and release of a mortgage, whether registered or unregistered, operates as if it were a deed, and transfers or releases to the current mortgagor the interest of the mortgagee in the mortgaged property to the extent specified in the instrument. 115. A possible argument is that if a discharge of a mortgage is required to enable the taxpayer to provide security for a replacement loan, expenditure in connection with the discharge of a mortgage is incurred in borrowing under the replacement loan. However, in Riviera Hotel and Neonex, although it was necessary to incur 20 expenditure in repaying an existing lender to satisfy a requirement that the replacement lender be given a first charge, the courts did not accept that the expenditure was incurred in borrowing money from the replacement lender. 116. In the Commissioner’s view, expenditure incurred for the discharge of a mortgage is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money, whether or not the discharge of mortgage is required to give security to a replacement lender. Such expenditure is incurred in terminating the interest of the existing mortgagee over the land subject to the mortgage. 117. On the basis of these cases, the Commissioner considers that:  Section DB 5 is not limited to expenditure on the preparation and registration of mortgages or other security documents. Expenditure incurred in borrowing money means costs that are incurred to obtain borrowed money. Interest, which is the price paid for the use of money, is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money.  Expenditure does not need to be paid out at the time of the borrowing to be incurred in borrowing money. Expenditure “incurred in borrowing money” includes expenditure the borrower is contractually obliged to pay during the life of the loan (even if the expenditure has not been incurred at the time of the borrowing), but only where a definitive contractual obligation to make the payment was incurred at the time of the borrowing (and as an incident of establishing the loan). However, expenditure that relates to bringing a borrowing to an end is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money.  A payment made to induce a lender to accept early repayment is expenditure incurred in repaying borrowed money rather than expenditure incurred in borrowing money, even if it is necessary to incur the expenditure to satisfy a requirement that the replacement lender be given a first charge. (However, such expenditure may potentially be brought into the base price adjustment required under the FA rules, see \[29\]–\[47\].)  Expenditure incurred for the discharge of a mortgage is not expenditure incurred in borrowing money. Such expenditure is related to bringing a borrowing to an end, because it is incurred in terminating the interest of the existing mortgagee over the land subject to the mortgage. This is the case whether or not it is necessary to incur costs in discharging an existing mortgage to give security for a new loan. Nexus between the expenditure and the borrowing of money 118. Section DB 5 does not permit a deduction for all expenditure incurred as part of the process of obtaining a loan. A sufficient connection must exist between the expenditure and the borrowing of money for the expenditure to be “incurred in borrowing money”. 119. Provided that none of the general limitations in s DA 2 apply, an amount of expenditure is deductible under s DA 1 to the extent to which the taxpayer incurs it:  in deriving their assessable income, excluded income or a combination of the two; or  in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving their assessable income, excluded income or a combination of the two. The courts have held that a sufficient connection must exist between the expenditure and the deriving of the taxpayer’s assessable income (ie, the expenditure must be incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s assessable income). 21 120. The Commissioner considers that generally, expenditure will have sufficient nexus with a borrowing if it is required by the lender in order for the borrower to obtain the borrowing, is relevant to and related to the borrowing, and does not result in the acquisition of more than minor assets or benefits other than the borrowing. Typically, expenditure such as legal expenses, valuation fees, guarantee fees (unless the taxpayer is required to use a spreading method under the FA rules) and other similar expenditure that relates to a loan transaction itself will have a sufficient nexus with the borrowing of the money to be deductible under s DB 5. Expenditure resulting in the acquisition of assets or benefits other than the borrowing 121. A connection between expenditure being incurred and a borrowing being obtained will not necessarily be enough for the expenditure to be correctly characterised as incurred “in borrowing money”. As noted, a sufficient nexus must exist between the expenditure and the borrowing, and the Commissioner considers that this will not be the case if the expenditure results in the acquisition of more than minor assets or benefits other than the borrowing. Insurance premiums 122. The issue of whether expenditure has a sufficient nexus with a borrowing to be characterised as being incurred “in borrowing money” has arisen in the context of life insurance required by a lender as security for a borrowing. The deductibility of life insurance premiums is specifically considered in this Interpretation Statement because there is conflicting case law on this issue. Also, the Commissioner understands that some taxpayers may have treated term life insurance premiums as deductible under s DB 5 on the basis of the conclusion in the item “Deductibility of mortgage repayment insurance taken out to obtain a business loan” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 9 (February 1995). That item stated that mortgage repayment insurance would be deductible under the predecessor to s DB 5. The Commissioner understands that mortgage repayment insurance is no longer used in a business context. However, in any event, as noted at \[24\], this Interpretation Statement replaces that item. 123. A financial institution may require life insurance (eg, over the lives of the directors of a company) as security for a loan. The following description of various types of life insurance policy is set out in New Zealand Business Law Guide (looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, 1985, updated to 28 August 2013) at \[80- 060\]: Whole of life The sum assured is payable in full on the death of the life assured. However, it is common for the payment of premiums to be required for only a limited term, which may be until age 60 or 65. Such a policy is almost invariably a “participating” policy, which means that the insurer adds a portion of its profits to the amount payable in the form of annual bonuses so that the longer the life assured lives the greater will be the sum payable on death. If the policy is surrendered after it has been in force for a minimum number of years, it has a cash value which is payable to the insured by the insurer. Term or temporary insurance The sum assured will be payable only if the life assured dies during a specified period, and if death does not occur during that time then nothing is payable. These are commonly converted to a whole of life policy or renewed for a further term. Endowment insurance This provides for the payment of a lump sum if the life assured survives until the end of the term of the policy or if the life assured dies during that period. These are generally participating policies which means that annual bonuses are added to the sum payable. They usually have a surrender value. 22 Investment insurance or insurance bonds This type of insurance provides a comparatively nominal death cover of whatever amount the policyholder requires. Its most important aspect is that the premiums paid, apart from the amount needed to purchase whatever death cover is required, are invested by the insurer and returns paid to the insured. Generally, a specified minimum sum must be paid for the first few years after the policy is taken out, but after that the payments become optional. Returns are based on the amount paid. The manner in which the returns are to be paid is also flexible, in that it may be by lump sum or by instalments. To some extent the insurer is acting as an investment broker for the insured, rather than only as an insurer. Annuities These provide for the payment of a lump sum by way of premium, in return for which the insurer agrees to pay specified amounts, either annually, quarterly or monthly, until the annuitant dies or for a fixed term. These are rare in New Zealand, except as part of a superannuation fund. Mortgage repayment insurance This form of life insurance is common in New Zealand and is frequently required by lending institutions. It is a single premium policy for an amount which is sufficient to repay whatever is owing on a mortgage. It is payable on the death of the life assured, who is the mortgagor. This means that it is for a restricted term and also for a decreasing amount, assuming that the liability under the mortgage is decreasing. 124. The following analysis looks at whether premiums on life insurance required by a lender as security for a loan are deductible under s DA 1 or s DB 5. The analysis is set out under the headings:  (i) Deductibility of life insurance premiums for policies required by a lender as security for a loan – section DA 1: discussed from \[125\].  (ii) Deductibility of life insurance premiums for policies required by a lender as security for a loan – section DB 5: discussed from \[131\]. - Case law on whether premiums on life insurance policies required as security are expenditure incurred in borrowing money: discussed from \[135\]. - Assignment of life insurance policies: discussed from \[163\].  (iii) Lenders mortgage insurance: discussed from \[165\]. (i) Deductibility of life insurance premiums for policies required by a lender as security for a loan – section DA 1 125. There are no relevant New Zealand cases on whether premiums for life insurance required by a lender as security for a loan are deductible under the general deductibility provision (s DA 1). However, the deductibility of such premiums under general deductibility provisions has been considered in Australia and Canada in Case 64, Equitable Acceptance, Côté-Reco and Case Y21. In each of these cases, it was considered that the premium on a life insurance policy was capital expenditure, and so not deductible under the relevant general deductibility provision. In Equitable Acceptance and Côté-Reco the Exchequer Court of Canada and the Canadian Tax Review Board, respectively, considered that any payments for the purpose of obtaining capital (ie, the loans) would be capital outlays, and so not deductible under the general provision. In Case 64 and Case Y21 the Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review and Administrative Appeals Tribunal, respectively, considered that the insurance policies in those cases were capital assets, and so the premiums were not deductible under the general provision. 126. In Case 64 a company borrowed money to purchase a business. A condition of the loan was that the managing director of the company would insure his life and assign the policy to the lender as collateral security. The Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review considered that the premiums brought into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the company’s business, and were 23 effective to build up a substantial asset under the insurance policy. The board concluded that the premiums were capital expenditure, being consideration for a capital asset (the policy), saying at 191: In this case the premium payments are bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s business. They are, as we have already said, building up a substantial asset under an insurance policy which, if it matures by the death of the Managing Director at any time before the debt of £3,250 is fully discharged, will provide the taxpayer with more than sufficient funds for that purpose. The Mortgagee insisted upon taking out this policy and evidently looks upon it as valuable collateral security. The capital character of the premiums appears in the fact that they are paid as consideration for – in substance they are the purchase price of – a capital asset, the hypothecation of which provided the funds for the purchase of the business by the taxpayer. 127. In Equitable Acceptance, Cattanach J considered that the premiums were incurred for the purpose of obtaining additional capital, so they were capital expenditure. That being the case, a deduction was allowable only if the premiums fell within the Canadian equivalent of s DB 5 (s 11(1)(cb)(ii) of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952). The court considered at \[23\]–\[25\] that: 23 The evidence clearly established that the money borrowed by the appellant from Triarch was forthwith deposited in the appellant's bank account and was used in the operation of the appellant's business. The loan was not comparable to mere temporary accommodation from the appellant's bankers, but was rather an addition to the capital of the appellant. 24 Any payments for the purpose of obtaining capital are outlays of capital within the meaning of Section 12(1)(b) \[of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952\]. 25 Therefore, it is quite clear the payment of premiums on the life insurance policies is not deductible unless it falls within the express terms of Section 11(1)(cb)(ii) of the Act \[the Canadian equivalent of s DB 5\] and the issue for determination is whether the said payment of the life insurance premiums constituted an expense incurred in the year in the course of borrowing money. 128. In Côté-Reco, the Tax Review Board considered that the premium on a life insurance policy was capital expenditure, being a payment made to obtain additional capital. Therefore, a deduction was not allowable under s 18(1)(a) of the Canadian Income Tax Act RSC 1952 (the equivalent of s DA 1). A deduction was precluded by s 18(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952, which prohibited the deduction of capital expenditure. The board noted at \[21\] and \[22\] that: 21 The evidence showed that the increase in the line of credit was necessary primarily to construct a building and purchase a computer. The increased line of credit used for these purposes constituted an increase in the capital of the company. Any payment made in order to obtain capital is covered by paragraph 18(1)(b) \[of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952\], not paragraph 18(1)(a) \[of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952\]. 22 Consequently, the expenditure made to pay an insurance premium guaranteeing the increase in the said line of credit cannot be deducted under paragraph 18(1)(a). 129. In Case Y21, the taxpayer had purchased a rental property using money provided by a family trust. The taxpayer then took out an endowment life insurance policy that was used as security for a loan from a finance company. The taxpayer claimed that the purpose of the loan was to repay the family trust. However, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not accept that there was a loan between the trust and the taxpayer. Therefore, the tribunal did not consider that the finance company loan was borrowed to repay a loan obtained to acquire the rental property. On that basis, the tribunal considered that the premiums were not deductible under the equivalent of s DA 1. The tribunal considered that even if the loan from the finance company had been borrowed to refinance a loan from the family trust to purchase the rental property, the premiums would not have been deductible. This was because the premiums were expenditure of a capital nature as they brought into existence an asset (the insurance policy) that was an enduring benefit. The tribunal noted at \[24\] that: 24 24. In the circumstances of these references, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the enduring benefit test, which takes its origin from the judgment of Viscount Cave L.C., in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited v Atherton (1926) AC 205, is relevant. His Lordship's opinion as to the characteristics of capital expenditure was expressed in the following terms: “But when an expenditure is made not only once and for all, with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefits of a trade, I think that there is very good reason (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital.” In the Tribunal's view the paying of premiums on a yearly basis rather than once and for all is, in the circumstances, of no consequence and does not alter the finding that the payment under consideration brought into existence an asset which was bound to come home in due course, subject only to continued payment of premiums during the life of the policy. The conclusion is inescapable that the transaction is an affair of capital. 130. The above cases confirm that a premium on a life insurance policy required by a lender as security for a loan is capital expenditure, either on the basis that it is incurred to obtain additional capital or on the basis that it is incurred to obtain a capital asset in the form of the policy. (ii) Deductibility of life insurance premiums for policies required by a lender as security for a loan – section DB 5 131. The Commissioner considers that to be deductible under s DB 5, the expenditure in question must be able to be characterised as being about establishing the loan, and must not be consideration for valuable benefits other than the loan. 132. It is a question of fact and judgement whether a particular expense is expenditure incurred in borrowing money or whether it is expenditure for something else. The necessary enquiry involves consideration of what the borrower acquires by making the payment. The acquisition of minor assets or benefits will not indicate a lack of sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the loan. For example, receipt of a valuation report would not mean that valuation fees were not expenditure incurred in borrowing money. However, where the assets or benefits acquired are more than minor, there will be an insufficient nexus between the expenditure and the loan. No precise lines can be drawn here – it is a matter of fact and judgement to determine whether the real nature of the transaction is that the borrower has incurred expenditure in order to obtain borrowed money (rather than to acquire some other asset or benefit) and so whether there is a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the borrowing of money for the expenditure to be regarded as incurred “in borrowing money”. 133. The Commissioner considers that the benefit obtained in relation to expenditure on life insurance premiums colours the character of the expenditure such that the required nexus between the expenditure and the borrowing of money is not met. Therefore, it is considered that expenditure on insurance premiums cannot be regarded as incurred “in borrowing money”, even if the lender requires the insurance as security for the loan. 134. There is no New Zealand case law on this issue. However, a body of Australian and Canadian case law supports the above view. Case law on whether premiums on life insurance policies required as security are expenditure incurred in borrowing money 135. In Case 19 (1966) 13 CTBR (NS) 124, the taxpayer was one of a group of trusts that had borrowed money to purchase an income-producing property. The lender required two life insurance policies over the life of the trustee. One of these policies was in existence at the time the money was borrowed and the other was taken out specifically to provide the required security. Annual bonuses were paid 25 under the policies, and the policies had a surrender value. The trusts paid the premium in respect of the second policy. The taxpayer claimed a deduction for its share of the premiums. 136. The Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review held that the premiums were not expenditure incurred in borrowing money. The premiums were expenditure on insurance, which was an asset that was separate and distinct from the loan itself, and the premiums were paid for valuable benefits (insurance over the life of the trustee, annual bonuses and a surrender value). The board noted at \[4\] that: 4. For several reasons, the expenditure with which we are concerned seems to fall outside the provisions of s. 67 \[of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936–1963 (Cth)\]. The outgoing had the character of expenditure on insurance, rather than expenditure in borrowing. The premiums under the policy, of the first of which the deduction claimed was part, are payable as consideration for valuable benefits, namely a continuing insurance on the life of the trustee, annual bonuses and a surrender value in the event of the policy being cashed before maturity. They lack entirely the character of a cost of borrowing and, though they are outgoings, are not expenses in the nature of costs at all. They are outgoings which will, in due course, result in a payment under the policy which may well be far in excess of the amount paid. Yet s. 67 speaks of expenditure rather than outgoings. .... In our opinion, therefore, the subject expenditure, rather than having the character of “expenditure incurred ... in borrowing”, was an outgoing incurred on insurance, which, though it qualified the trustee to obtain the loan and provided collateral security for the repayment thereof, was, nevertheless, a thing distinct from, and independent of, the loan itself. 137. In Case Y21, the tribunal adopted the reasoning in Case 19 and held that the premium on an endowment policy was not expenditure incurred in borrowing money. This was because the expenditure brought into existence an asset (the policy) from which the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s family stood to gain, either on death or at maturity of the policy. The tribunal noted at \[23\] and \[26\] that: 23. Court decisions over the years demonstrate that in a determination of this kind, there is no one test capable of universal application. What does become clear, is that the character of the outgoing must be considered in the context of all the circumstances. There is no doubt that the payment of the premium brought into existence an asset of some significance i.e. the policy of assurance, and that at some time in the future, either upon death or at maturity, the applicant and/or members of his family stood to gain financially. In simple terms, the policy is an investment and the premiums paid represent its cost. That the policy was used as security alters nothing, in fact it supports such a conclusion. 26. ... the Tribunal is of the view that it would be wrong to describe the payment of a premium on a policy of life assurance, as an expense incurred in borrowing money. The same view was expressed by the Taxation Board of Review No 2 in 13 CTBR (NS) 124 Case 19. ... 138. In Equitable Acceptance the court held that premiums on whole of life insurance policies were not an expense incurred in the course of borrowing money. The court considered that although the purchase (and assignment) of the policies was a condition of the loan, the true nature of the transaction was that in return for the payment of the premiums the borrower obtained an asset that could be used as security for the borrowing of money. The court noted at \[27\] that: 27 ... the cost of the purchase of the two life insurance policies and the maintenance in force thereof by the payment of premiums is not an expense incurred in the year in the course of borrowing money used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business. While it is true that the purchase of these life insurance policies and their assignment to Triarch \[Triarch Corporation Limited\] was a condition imposed by Triarch before making the loan to the appellant, nevertheless the true nature of the transaction was that the appellant acquired an asset which could be used, and was in fact used, as a collateral security necessary to borrow money to be used in its business. In short, the appellant, by the purchase of the two insurance policies, merely enhanced its position as a reliable lending risk. \[Emphasis added\] 139. The court also noted that if the insured had died during the term of the loan while the policies were in force, the taxpayer’s net position would have improved 26 because the loan would have been repaid in full without any corresponding debit entry. Further, if the proceeds of the policy had exceeded the amount required to repay the loan, the taxpayer would have been entitled to receive the excess. Also, once the loan was repaid, the policy was available to provide security for another loan: 28 If the insured, Emil E. Schlesinger, had died while the policies were in force and before the repayment of the loan, the appellant would then be in the position of the loan being fully paid from the proceeds of the insurance policies and the amount of the loan received by the appellant would become part of the appellant’s assets without any corresponding debit entry. Again if the proceeds were in excess of the amount required to repay the loan, then any such excess would have accrued to the appellant’s assets. Further when the loan was repaid, as it was, there was nothing to prevent the appellant from securing another loan from the same or a different source on the strength of the security of the two life insurance policies, if the necessity arose. 140. Obiter comments in Irwin v MNR \[1978\] CTC 3,247 also confirm that premiums on a life insurance policy used as security for a loan are not deductible. In Irwin, the taxpayer had purchased his father’s shares in a company. A condition of the purchase agreement was that the taxpayer was to purchase term life insurance on his father’s life and pay the premiums on the policy. If the father died, the proceeds of the policy would be applied to the balance owing on the purchase of the shares. The Canadian Tax Review Board considered that the relationship between the taxpayer and his father was a debtor–creditor relationship rather than a borrower–lender relationship. On that basis, the premiums were not deductible. However, even if there had been a borrower–lender relationship, the board considered that, on the authority of Equitable Acceptance, the premiums would not be deductible: 30 The facts however in the Equitable Acceptance case are distinguishable from those in the instant appeal in that the appellant actually borrowed and received monies which were used in the operation of its business. The purchase of the insurance policies which was also a condition of the loan was only collateral security for the loan and it was held that the premiums paid thereon had nothing to do with expenses incurred in the borrowing of money used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income. 32 In the instant appeal, although the purchase of a $50,000 life insurance policy was a condition of the purchase of share agreement, the subject transaction was basically the purchase and sale of a capital asset giving rise to a debtor-creditor relationship in which part of the appellant’s debt was secured by a life insurance on his father’s life and payable on his death to his father’s estate, if the balance of the selling price had not been paid. No evidence was produced, not even a promissory note as in the McCool case (supra), which might be interpreted as the appellant having borrowed money from his father and even less that the borrowed monies had been used by the appellant for the purpose of earning income from the business. 33 If the facts in the Equitable Acceptance case (supra) led the Court to conclude that the life insurance premiums paid by the appellant did not constitute an expense in the course of borrowing money then a fortiori do the facts in the instant appeal justify the same conclusion. \[Emphasis added\] 141. In the 1988 case of Guertin, the company had borrowed to purchase land and construct buildings to expand its operations. Whole of life insurance policies on the life of the president of the company were transferred to the lender as security for the loan. The company claimed a deduction of an amount equal to the premiums that would have been payable had it purchased term policies on the president’s life, instead of whole of life policies. Marceau J in the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal noted that as the court must deal with what the taxpayer actually did, not what the taxpayer could have done, it was not strictly necessary to determine whether there was a distinction between permanent and temporary insurance. Therefore, even if there were a distinction, because the company had obtained permanent insurance, the premiums were not deductible. However, the court considered whether such a distinction existed, because it was the focus of the parties’ submissions. 27 142. The court considered that the basis of the decision in Equitable Acceptance was that the true nature of the transaction was that the taxpayer had acquired an asset. The right of an insured under a term life insurance policy was considered to be as much an asset as a whole of life policy, and could be used as security in the same way. Therefore, the court considered that the reasoning in Equitable Acceptance was equally applicable to term life policies, whether or not the term of the insurance policy correlated with the term of the loan. The court considered that to be expenditure incurred in the course of a loan, the expenditure must result in a diminution of the borrower’s property. As the right under a term life policy was of equivalent value to the premium, the court considered that payment of the premium under a term life policy did not result in diminution of the borrower’s property. The court stated at \[5\]–\[7\] that: 5. I should say first that I have some difficulty understanding how the scope of the judgment in Equitable Acceptance Corporation can be limited to cases in which the life insurance obtained and transferred is whole life insurance. In my opinion, Cattanach J.’s reasoning is entirely contained in this paragraph from his reasons: In my view the cost of the purchase of the two life insurance policies and the maintenance in force thereof by the payment of premiums is not an expense incurred in the year in the course of borrowing money used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business. While it is true that the purchase of these life insurance policies and their assignment to Triarch was a condition imposed by Triarch before making the loan to the appellant, nevertheless the true nature of the transaction was that the appellant acquired an asset which could be used, and was in fact used, as a collateral security necessary to borrow money to be used in its business. In short, the appellant, by the purchase of the two insurance policies, merely enhanced its position as a reliable lending risk. 6. It seems to me that this reasoning applies just as much to the case of temporary insurance as to that of whole life insurance. The right of the insured under a temporary life insurance contract is an “asset” in the sense in which the word is used by Cattanach, J., that is, a usable security from which a benefit can be obtained, or valuable property, in the same way as the right conferred on an insured by a “permanent” life insurance contract, even though the asset is of a lower value and its transformation into cash is of course only a contingency. Cattanach J.’s judgment has often been treated as based simply on an interpretation of the phrase “in the course of” contained in the wording of the applicable provision, the judge being of the view that the expense was prior to the loan and not “in the course of borrowing” (cf Côté-Reco Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue, \[1980\] CTC 2019, 80 DTC 1012). On the contrary, the reasoning appears to me to go much further than that. I understand it to mean that, in order to speak strictly and accurately of an expense incurred in the course of a loan, the expenditure must as such have had no consideration other than the loan, or in other words, it must be an expenditure resulting in a diminution of the borrower’s property. The property right represented by temporary insurance is the premium paid in another form with an equivalent value, and no diminution could possibly result in the property of the insured. 7 It is true that, in his reasons, Cattanach, J. went on to say, in a paragraph subsequent to the one just cited, the following: If the insured, Emil E. Schlesinger, had died while the policies were in force and before the repayment of the loan, the appellant would then be in the position of the loan being fully paid from the proceeds of the insurance policies and the amount of the loan received by the appellant would become part of the appellant's assets without any corresponding debit entry. Again if the proceeds were in excess of the amount required to repay the loan, then any such excess would have accrued to the appellant’s assets. Further when the loan was repaid, as it was, there was nothing to prevent the appellant from securing another loan from the same or a different source on the strength of the security of the two life insurance policies, if the necessity arose. In my view, however, in so doing the judge added nothing to his reasoning and merely elucidated the various aspects of the “asset” represented by the policies at issue in the case before him .... In my view the reasoning underlying Equitable Acceptance Corporation applies just as much to temporary insurance for the duration of the loan as to insurance which will continue beyond it, and it is a reasoning which appears to me to be unimpeachable. \[Emphases added\] 28 143. In Elirpa Construction & Materials Ltd v Canada \[1995\] 2 CTC 2,968, which concerned a whole of life policy, the taxpayer argued that there was a distinction between whole of life insurance and term life insurance, and that the only issue was the amount of the deduction. The Tax Court of Canada considered that on the authority of Guertin, no deduction was allowable. However, a different approach had been taken in the earlier cases of Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers Ltd v MNR \[1984\] CTC 2,210, which concerned term life policies. As noted at \[150\], in Guertin the court considered that in Côté-Reco the board had misunderstood the decision in Equitable Acceptance. The court in Elirpa cited that aspect of the judgment in Guertin with approval. 144. In the 1980 case of Côté-Reco, the company was required to assign term life or temporary life insurance policies as security for the extension of a line of credit. The Tax Review Board of Canada disagreed with the reasoning in Equitable Acceptance, and considered that it was not bound to follow that case given the conclusion in MNR v Yonge-Eglinton Building Ltd \[1974\] CTC 209. In Yonge- Eglinton, it was held that to be deductible as an expense incurred in the course of borrowing money, expenditure must be incurred “in connection with”, “incidental to” or “arising from” the process of borrowing money. In Côté-Reco, the board considered that the company had purchased the policies “in the course of borrowing money” (ie, “in connection with”, “incidental to” or “arising from” the process of borrowing money), stating at \[41\]–\[44\]: 41 In the Board’s opinion, the payment of insurance policy premiums complies word for word with the condition specified by subparagraph 20(1)(e)(ii), namely that the expense was incurred “dans l’année à l’occasion d’un emprunt contracté par le contribuable et utilisé en vue de tirer un revenu d’une entreprise ou de bien ...” 42 It is worth citing the English wording: (e) an expense incurred in the year, (ii) in the course of borrowing money used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning income from a business or property ... 43 The phrase “in the course of” may appear at first sight to have a more limited meaning than “à l’occasion de”. In 1974, however, ten years after the Equitable Acceptance Corp Ltd judgment \[supra\], in Yonge-Eglinton Building Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, \[1974\] CTC 209, 74 DTC 6180, the Federal Court of Appeal, per Thurlow, J, explained the meaning of “in the course of”, and appeared to give it a rather broad meaning, at least as broad as “à l’occasion de”: It may not always be easy to decide whether an expense has so arisen but it seems to me that the words “in the course of” in section 11(1)(cb) are not a reference to the time when the expenses are incurred but are used in the sense of “in connection with” or “incidental to” or “arising from” and refer to the process of carrying out or the things which must be undertaken to carry out the issuing or selling or borrowing for or in connection with which the expenses are incurred. 44 Although the Court made this comment in a discussion of time, the broad meaning given to the phrase “in the course of”, is still valid. When the appellant purchased its two insurance policies to guarantee the loan (a condition required by the lender), it did so "in the course of borrowing money" although, as Cattanach, J observed, in doing so the appellant “merely enhanced its position as a reliable lending risk”. 145. The board considered that this conclusion was not altered by the fact that the company, by taking out life insurance, had enhanced its position as a reliable lending risk. The board also considered the possibility that the insured could have died while the loan was outstanding and the proceeds of the insurance may have exceeded the amount required to repay the loan. The board considered that it was irrelevant that in this scenario the company would have had a sum of money left over from the proceeds after repaying the loan. The board stated at \[45\] that: 45 The Board considers that even if the insured died and the appellant, after receiving the indemnity and paying the balance owed the lender, still had a substantial amount in its bank account, that does not alter the fact that the payment of the premiums, at least in 29 the earlier years, was made “in the course of borrowing money”. It appears to the Board that once the situation falls word for word within the Act, particularly in an exempting section, there is no need to look for hypothetical consequences which might be more favourable to the taxpayer, and then if any are found, disallow the exemption. The phrases “à l’occasion de” or “in the course of”, in the broad meaning given them by the Federal Court of Appeal, do not allow of such a restrictive interpretation. 146. In the 1984 case of Economy Carriers, the taxpayer’s bank had granted a line of credit for operating capital, the purchase of equipment, and the purchase of a terminal and land. Term insurance policies on the lives of key employees of the taxpayer were assigned to the bank as a condition of the provision of the loan. The Tax Court of Canada considered that if the insurance policies had been whole of life policies, the premiums would not have been deductible. The court applied Côté-Reco and held that the premiums were deductible, because the payment of the premiums was necessary to obtain the loan, under which the taxpayer obtained a lower rate of interest on borrowing for the purpose of gaining or producing income. The court stated at \[8-11\] that: 8. ... Trucking companies, basically their equipment, are under conditional sales contracts, the terms of which are rather onerous considering the interest charged by the truck manufacturers. It was certainly open to the Company to obtain a line of credit for operating capital, the purchase of equipment, the purchase of a terminal in Edmonton and land. This was a reasonable and viable approach by the company to effect the purpose of gaining or producing income from its business or property. The insurance was term insurance. Otherwise, if it had been permanent insurance, it would readily be disallowed. See Antoine Guertin Ltée v The Queen, \[1981\] C.T.C. 351, 81 D.T.C. 5268. With respect to the respondent’s allegations that the insurance premiums were not expenses incurred in the year in the course of borrowing money, I would refer to the case of MNR v Yonge-Eglinton Building Ltd, \[1974\] C.T.C. 209, 74 D.T.C. 6180, a decision of Thurlow, J of the Federal Court of Appeal, and in particular I refer to what he says at 214 and 6183 respectively: It would be untenable if it meant that the expense must be incurred in the taxation year of the issuing or selling or borrowing and since it is impossible to know what is included in “around the time” it seems to me to be untenable on that basis as well. What appears to me to be the test is whether the expense, in whatever taxation year it occurs, arose from the issuing or selling or borrowing. It may not always be easy to decide whether an expense has so arisen but it seems to me that the words “in the course of” in section 11(1)(cb) \[of the Income Tax Act RSC 1952\] are not a reference to the time when the expenses are incurred but are used in the sense of “in connection with” or “incidental to” or “arising from” and refer to the process of carrying out or the things which must be undertaken to carry out the issuing or selling or borrowing for or in connection with which the expenses are incurred. In my opinion therefore since the amounts here in question arose from and were incidental to the borrowing of money required to finance the construction of the respondent’s building they fall within section 11(1)(cb)(ii) as expenses incurred in the year in the course of borrowing money etc ... This case clearly illustrates the deductibility of premiums on insurance during the course of the operations of the taxpayer’s business. 9 I particularly rely on the decision of my learned colleague Tremblay, J in the case of Côté- Reco Inc v Minister of National Revenue, \[1980\] C.T.C. 2019, 80 D.T.C. 1012, at 2024 and 1016 respectively: The phrase “in the course of” may appear at first sight to have a more limited meaning than “à l'occasion de”. In 1974, however, ten years after the Equitable Acceptance Corp Ltd, judgment, in Yonge-Eglinton Building Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, \[1974\] CTC 209, 74 DTC 6180, the Federal Court of Appeal, per Thurlow, J, explained the meaning of “in the course of”, and appeared to give it a rather broad meaning as \[sic\] least as broad as “à l'occasion de”: “It may not always be easy to decide whether an expense has so arisen but it seems to me that the words ‘in the course of’ in section 11(1)(cb) are not a reference to the time when the expenses are incurred but are used in the sense of ‘in connection with’ or ‘incidental to’ or ‘arising from’ and refer to the process of carrying out or the things which must be undertaken to carry out the issuing or selling or borrowing for or in connection with which the expenses are incurred.” 30 10 Being acutely aware of the vicissitudes of the “trucking business”, and the very high cost of commercial financing for the purchase of trucking equipment, the course of action of the appellant was completely reasonable and prudent having regard to the demands of the company’s bank. The appellant did what it had to do to increase its business and its outlays for insurance premiums were a condition prerequisite for the purpose of gaining or producing income from its business or property. 11 I therefore find that the premiums paid on term insurance as collateral for a line of credit with the Royal Bank of Canada were properly deductible in the course of the appellant’s business and the said premiums were outlays for the purpose of gaining or producing income. \[Emphasis added\] 147. In Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers, the Tax Review Board and Tax Court considered that, because the taking out of the policies was a condition of the loans, the premiums were an expense incurred “in the course of” borrowing money. Therefore, premiums on term life insurance policies were held to be deductible. The courts considered that their approach was supported by Yonge- Eglinton, which was decided after Equitable Acceptance. However, Yonge- Eglinton considered a timing issue, rather than the nature of the expenditure. This is apparent from the judgment of Thurlow J at \[9\] and \[10\]: 9 This provision has been considered in a number of cases \[see footnote (FN) 4 below\] and has received in general a strict and in one case what might be regarded as a narrow construction. In none of them, however, has a point comparable to the present arisen. 10 The Minister’s position, as I understand it, is not that the amounts were not expenses of borrowing money but that in order to qualify for deduction the expense must be one that is incurred at or around the time the borrowing takes place and that here the liability to pay the amounts was not incurred in the course of the borrowing but in years after the borrowing took place upon profits being earned from the operation of the building. Counsel for the Minister further contended that the amounts were bonuses within the meaning of subparagraph (iii). FN4 Equitable Acceptance Corporation Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, \[1964\] C.T.C. 74, 64 D.T.C. 5045; The Consumers’ Gas Company v Minister of National Revenue, \[1965\] C.T.C. 225, 65 D.T.C. 5138; Sherritt Gordon Mines, Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, \[1968\] C.T.C. 262 at 290, 68 D.T.C. 5180 at 5196-7; Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation v Minister of National Revenue, \[1971\] C.T.C. 694, 71 D.T.C. 5409; Riviera Hotel Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue, \[1972\] C.T.C. 157, 72 D.T.C. 6142. 148. In Equitable Acceptance, the issue for consideration was the nature of life insurance premiums (ie, what the premiums were paid for). The court considered that the true nature of the transaction was that the taxpayer acquired an asset that could be used as security for borrowing money. The fact the purchase (and assignment) of the policies was a condition of the loan did not alter the nature of the transaction. Similar views were expressed in Case 19 and Case Y21. Obiter comments made by the court in Guertin indicate that that reasoning is equally applicable to term life policies. 149. With the exception of Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers, premiums on life insurance policies have been regarded as expenditure to acquire an “asset” (the right to be paid under the policy) able to be used as security for the borrowing of money rather than expenditure incurred in borrowing money. 150. In Côté-Reco, the court expressed doubt as to the correctness of the reasoning in Equitable Acceptance. The implication is that the board considered that whole of life insurance was not distinguishable from term life insurance, and that premiums on both whole of life and term insurance policies were deductible under the equivalent of s DB 5. However, in Guertin the court considered that in Côté- Reco the board had misunderstood the decision in Equitable Acceptance. 151. The Commissioner acknowledges that the discussion of Equitable Acceptance in Guertin is obiter. However, the Guertin decision came after Côté-Reco, and is a Canadian Federal Court of Appeal decision, which is of higher authority to both Côté-Reco (Canadian Tax Review Board) and Economy Carriers (Tax Court of 31 Canada). It is also noted that Guertin was applied in a subsequent Tax Court of Canada case, Elirpa. The court in Elirpa stated at \[4\]: in order to speak strictly and accurately of an expense incurred in the course of a loan, the expenditure must as such have had no consideration other than the loan, or in other words, it must be an expenditure resulting in a diminution of the borrower’s property. 152. Although in Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers deductions were allowed for premiums on term life policies, the Commissioner considers that subsequent higher level authority should be preferred. Further, the Commissioner considers that the reasoning in Guertin is more persuasive than that in Côté-Reco or Economy Carriers. 153. To determine the character of expenditure, it is necessary to consider the legal arrangements entered into and carried out under which expenditure is incurred (Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271). In Marac Life Assurance Co Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086, the Court of Appeal adopted the definition of life insurance in Bunyon on the Law of Life Assurance (5th ed, C & E Layton, London, 1914 at 1): The contract of insurance has been defined by Tindal CJ to be that in which a sum of money “as a premium is paid in consideration of the insurer’s incurring the risk of paying a larger sum upon a given contingency”. ... The contract of life insurance may be further defined to be that in which one party agrees to pay a given sum upon the happening of a particular event contingent upon the duration of human life, in consideration of the immediate payment of a smaller sum or certain equivalent periodical payments by another. This consideration in money is termed the premium or premiums, and is paid either in one sum, when it is termed a single premium, or by a succession of periodical instalments. ... 154. The essence of any life insurance contract is that in consideration for the payment of the premium or premiums, the policy holder acquires the right to be paid a specific sum upon the death of the person insured. In The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd v FCT (1959) 102 CLR 29 (HCA), Windeyer J considered that this description applied to all forms of life insurance. Therefore, under any life insurance contract (regardless of the type of policy), the advantages obtained from the payment of premiums include the right to a specific sum under the policy upon the happening of the insured event (the death of the person insured). 155. Although the right to payment of the sum insured is contingent on the happening of the insured event, the contractual rights held by the owner of the policy are themselves an asset or benefit (a chose in action – see, for example Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 at \[212\]). In Marac, Cooke P considered that although the right to be paid under a life insurance policy is contingent, all life insurance can be regarded as an investment, stating at 5,090 that: In the general sense all life insurance is investment. What distinguishes it from other kinds of investment is that the gain or yield, if there is one, depends on the contingencies of human life. 156. In Marac, McMullin J commented at 5,103 that: Most holders of life insurance would look on their policies as investments, even though the benefits of these policies are more likely to be enjoyed by persons other than themselves. 157. As suggested in Case Y21, the fact a life insurance policy is used as security for a loan supports the view that premiums under life insurance policies are paid for an asset. New Zealand Business Law Guide (looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, 1985, updated to 28 August 2013) states at \[80-080\] that: A life insurance policy is a piece of property with some value because the insurer has to pay the sum assured at some time. It is therefore common for life insurance policies to be transferred or to be used as security. 32 If term life insurance were not an asset, it would not be possible to use it as security for a loan. 158. The contingent rights under a life insurance policy are certainly, as Marceau J observed in Guertin, “an “asset” in the sense in which the word is used by Cattanach, J. \[in Equitable Acceptance\], that is, a usable security from which a benefit can be obtained, or valuable property”. 159. In any event, it seems clear from the above cases that the obtaining of a benefit (whether or not it can be described as an asset, or would be recorded as an asset for accounting purposes) will colour the nature of the expenditure such that it cannot accurately be said to be incurred in borrowing money, but rather for the asset or benefit obtained. 160. The Commissioner considers that the weight of authority establishes that premiums on life insurance, including term life insurance, are not deductible under s DB 5(1). In the Commissioner’s view, it is not possible to distinguish between term life insurance and other types of life insurance. Regardless of whether the term and sum insured under the policy correlate with the term and amount of the loan, or whether the policy has a surrender value, the right to payment under a life insurance policy is an asset or a benefit. 161. The Commissioner also considers that it is not possible to distinguish mortgage repayment insurance from other types of life insurance. Mortgage repayment insurance is a type of term life insurance (though it may also cover other contingencies) under which a single premium is paid on the commencement of the policy, the term of the policy coincides with the term of the loan, and the sum insured reduces as the balance of the loan reduces. As with other life insurance policies, the payment of a premium under mortgage repayment insurance is paid for the right to be paid under the policy. (In any event, mortgage repayment insurance is usually obtained in respect of loans for private or domestic purposes. Premiums on such insurance taken out in connection with a loan for private purposes would not be deductible under s DB 5 as the loan would not be capital employed in deriving income.) 162. For the reasons outlined above, it is the Commissioner’s view that the premiums under any life insurance policy are correctly characterised as being for a benefit other than the loan (being the right to be paid the sum insured under the policy). Therefore, the Commissioner considers that it is not possible to distinguish between insurance policies according to whether the term and amount of the policy correlate with that of the loan, whether the policy has a surrender value, or whether bonuses are paid. Assignment of life insurance policies 163. A borrower may be required to give an assignment of a life insurance policy as security for a loan. The assignee of a life insurance policy becomes the legal owner of the policy (s 43(1) of the Life Insurance Act 1908). Alternatively, a borrower could give a mortgage over a life insurance policy in favour of the lender. In Craven v Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1948\] NZLR 550 (where a son had granted a mortgage over a life insurance policy in favour of his father) Blair J considered that until the date of the mortgage the son was the legal and beneficial owner of the policy and that after the mortgage was granted, the father was the legal owner of the policy subject to the son’s equity of redemption. An implied term of every mortgage of a life insurance policy (unless that term is negatived, modified or altered in the mortgage) is that on repayment of the principal and interest secured by the mortgage and on performance of all other obligations under the mortgage, the mortgagee will execute a discharge of the mortgage (s 45 and schedule 14 of the Life Insurance Act 1908). 33 164. In the Commissioner’s view, the fact that during the term of a loan the lender is the legal owner of a life insurance policy given as security for the loan, so that the proceeds of the policy are payable to the lender, is irrelevant. In Equitable Acceptance, no weight was given to the fact that there was such an assignment. The court considered that the true nature of the transaction was that in consideration for the premiums, the borrower obtained an asset that could be used as security for a loan. A borrower could not give an assignment or mortgage of a life insurance policy unless the policy was initially the property of the borrower. Even if the proceeds of the policy were payable to the lender, the proceeds of the policy would be applied to repay the amount owing by the borrower. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that premiums on a life insurance policy given as security for a loan (whether by way of assignment or by way of mortgage or in any other way) should be characterised as expenditure incurred by the borrower to acquire an asset or benefit (the rights under the policy). (iii) Lenders mortgage insurance 165. Lenders mortgage insurance (insurance to protect the lender from loss in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan) is always an asset of the lender, rather than of the borrower. 166. Under lenders mortgage insurance, the lender is the insured. If an insurance company makes a payment to the lender under lenders mortgage insurance, the insurance company is entitled to step into the shoes of the lender. Laws of New Zealand Insurance (online ed, accessed 5 August 2013) at \[441\] states that: Subrogation is where one person is substituted for another so that he or she takes on the rights of the other. As applied to the field of insurance, the insurer’s right of subrogation means the right to be placed in the position of the insured so that the insurer has the benefit of the insured’s rights against third parties. 167. Therefore, a pay-out under a lenders mortgage insurance policy would not release the borrower from liability in connection with the loan. On that basis, lenders mortgage insurance is distinguishable from life insurance. The passed on cost of lenders mortgage insurance may be deductible under s DB 5, if it is expenditure that the borrower is required to incur to obtain a loan. This may be the case if the cost of such premiums is passed on to the borrower by way of a “recharge”. However such costs would not be deductible under s DB 5 where they have to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules or where they are incorporated into the interest rate. In those circumstances, such costs would be deductible under s DB 6, s DB 7 or, if not under those provisions, potentially under s DA 1. 168. For similar reasons, nothing can be taken from the fact that guarantee fees are deductible (see, for example, Ure). If a guarantor makes a payment to the lender, as between the lender and the borrower, the debt is repaid; but the guarantor is entitled to be indemnified by the borrower (s 85 of the Judicature Act 1908). For that reason, a guarantee cannot be regarded as an asset of the borrower or as providing a benefit to the borrower. As with lenders mortgage insurance, a guarantee is for the benefit of the lender. Summary – deductibility of insurance premiums 169. On the basis of the above discussion, the Commissioner’s view is that:  Premiums on life insurance policies (regardless of the type of life insurance) is expenditure incurred in acquiring an asset or benefit (the right to be paid under the policy) rather than expenditure incurred in borrowing money. It 34 follows that a deduction is not allowable under s DB 5 for premiums on any life insurance policy.  Even if the lender is the legal owner of the life insurance policy that they require as security for the loan, the borrower’s expenditure on the premium is incurred in the obtaining of an asset or benefit (that can be used as security), rather than in borrowing money, so is not deductible under s DB 5.  The passed on cost of lenders mortgage insurance may be deductible under s DB 5, if it is expenditure that the borrower is required to incur to obtain a loan. This may be the case if the cost of such premiums is passed on to the borrower by way of a “recharge”. This is because the lender is the insured, and any payment under the policy would not release the borrower from liability in connection with the loan. (However, this will not be the case where such costs have to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules or are incorporated into the interest rate. In those circumstances, such costs would be deductible under s DB 6, s DB 7 or, if not under those provisions, potentially under s DA 1. Types of expenditure incurred “in borrowing money” 170. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of expenditure deductible under s DB 5. Whether particular expenditure is deductible under s DB 5 depends on whether the expenditure meets the requirements of the section as set out in this statement, whether the expenditure needs to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules, and whether it is expenditure that relates to a mixed-use asset (in which case the deductibility of the expenditure would be determined under subpart DG). However, expenditure that will typically be deductible under s DB 5 (where not required to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules and where not required to be considered under subpart DG) includes:  legal fees in connection with establishing a loan;  valuation fees, where the lender requires the valuation;  guarantee fees;  the passed on cost of lenders mortgage insurance (where the cost is passed on to the borrower as a “recharge”);  loan procurement fees;  survey fees, where the lender requires the surveying;  mortgage brokers’ commissions;  costs of arranging bank overdrafts; and  certain expenses relating to debenture issues (such as drafting, advertising and printing prospectuses). 171. The expenditure listed above is expenditure that taxpayers commonly incur when establishing or setting up a loan. For example, if the taxpayer is obtaining a mortgage, the lending institution will often require a valuation of the property and valuation fees will be incurred. The expenditure listed above will usually relate solely to the loan. As the sole reason for the expenditure is to obtain the loan, it is unlikely that the expenditure will give rise to benefits distinct from and independent of the loan, and the expenditure is likely to have a sufficient nexus with the borrowing of the money. 35 Taxpayer must use borrowed money as capital in the derivation of their income 172. Section DB 5 requires that the money borrowed be “used as capital in deriving \[the taxpayer’s\] income”. 173. As noted at \[50\], generally borrowed money is regarded as an addition to capital (Caltex; The Shell Company of China; Public Trustee). Where this is the case, and where the use of the money meets the nexus with the taxpayer’s income derivation, the requirement in s DB 5 for the borrowed money to be used as capital in deriving income will be satisfied. 174. However, as noted at \[51\], in some circumstances borrowed money is a revenue item (Scottish North American Trust; Texas Co (Australasia); Canada Permanent Mortgage Corp; AVCO Financial Services; Coles Myer Finance). For instance, borrowed money is a revenue item where a taxpayer is in the business of borrowing and lending money and the money is borrowed for on-lending in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business, or where a taxpayer borrows money to purchase trading stock. Expenditure incurred to secure circulating capital is revenue expenditure and may be deductible under s DA 1. 175. The words “used as capital in deriving income” in s DB 5 focus on how the taxpayer who borrowed the money uses that money. If the taxpayer uses the borrowed money as capital in deriving their income, this requirement of the section has been satisfied. 176. This view is supported by the decision in Ure. As discussed above, in Ure the Australian Federal Court considered the meaning of the word “used” in the context of s 67(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1976 (Cth) (equivalent to s DB 5). The court was unanimous in its decision that s 67 does not refer to the use made by persons other than the taxpayer of the money borrowed by the taxpayer. It refers to the use made of that money by the taxpayer. In Ure, the only use the taxpayer had made of the money was to lend it to his wife or the trust at an interest rate of 1%. Therefore, the money was held to be used by the taxpayer for the purpose of earning assessable income. 177. Apportionment of expenditure incurred in borrowing money is not required where there is a capital aspect to the use of the funds as well as an income-earning use (Pacific Rendezvous v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,146). Alternative arguments Preference for following Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers 178. The Commissioner acknowledges there are alternative views on some aspects of this Interpretation Statement. In relation to the cases on the deductibility of insurance premiums (discussed from \[135\] – \[162\]), it has been argued that the Commissioner should follow the ratio in Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers in relation to term life insurance premiums, rather than the obiter comments in Guertin. It has further been argued that the court in Guertin may have been influenced by the substantial nature of the benefits arising under the whole of life policies at issue in that case. 179. Following the ratio in Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers in relation to term life insurance premiums would not alter what the Commissioner considers the test under s DB 5 to be. Rather, it would lead to a conclusion that, at least in some circumstances, term life insurance premiums may be able to be characterised as incurred “in borrowing money”. 36 180. The Commissioner acknowledges that the discussion of Equitable Acceptance in Guertin is obiter. However, as noted at \[151\], the Guertin decision came after Côté-Reco and is a Canadian Federal Court of Appeal decision, which is of higher authority than both Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers. It is also noted that Guertin was applied in a subsequent Tax Court of Canada case, Elirpa. Although in Côté-Reco and Economy Carriers deductions were allowed for premiums on term life policies, the Commissioner considers that subsequent higher level authority should be preferred. Further, the Commissioner considers that the reasoning in Guertin is more persuasive than that in Côté-Reco or Economy Carriers. Relevance of Pacific Rendezvous 181. It could be argued that “mixed purpose” in terms of the expenditure (as opposed to the use to which the borrowed money is put) would not prevent a deduction. That is, it could be suggested that the fact that the taxpayer obtains a benefit other than satisfying the lending criteria (and so being able to establish the borrowing) does not preclude deductibility under s DB 5 because the nexus test can still be met. 182. For the purposes of s DB 5, expenditure a taxpayer incurs in borrowing money will be deductible if the taxpayer uses the money as capital in deriving their income. As noted at \[177\], apportionment of expenditure incurred in borrowing money is not required where there is a capital aspect to the use of the funds as well as an income-earning use (Pacific Rendezvous). 183. However, the insurance cases relied on in support of the Commissioner’s view that insurance premiums are not deductible under s DB 5 concern the character of the expenditure. This was not the issue in Pacific Rendezvous, where the expenditure was clearly interest, and the question was whether it was paid on capital employed in the production of assessable income. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary to determine the true character of the expenditure for s DB 5 purposes to determine whether a sufficient nexus exists between the expenditure and the borrowing of money. This is what the various insurance cases relied on are concerned with. It is not a question of mixed use of the borrowed money, but one of characterisation of the expenditure as either having a sufficient nexus with the borrowing to be regarded as incurred “in borrowing money” or not. Examples 184. The following examples show how the Commissioner considers that the requirements discussed above apply to determine whether expenditure is deductible under s DB 5. These examples are illustrative only and do not cover the wide variety of factual situations that may arise. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The examples proceed on the basis that the deductibility of the expenditure in question does not need to be considered under subpart DG because it is not incurred in relation to a mixed-use asset. Example 1 185. A farmer wishes to buy additional land to expand his farm. He applies for a loan to purchase the land and cover the costs of fencing the land. As a condition of the loan approval, the bank requires the farmer to obtain an independent valuation of the land and to get the land surveyed before fencing starts. The farmer is also required to pay a loan establishment fee. The farmer is not a cash basis person. 37 186. The farmer can deduct the costs of the valuation and the surveying under s DB 5 (those costs would not come under the FA rules, because they are non-contingent fees – being payable whether or not the loan proceeds). The farmer is required to use a spreading method under the FA rules, so must take the loan establishment fee into account and spread it under those rules. This is because it is consideration for a financial arrangement (and is payable only if the loan is actually established, so is not a non-contingent fee). Example 2 187. Company A has arranged for a bank loan to expand its hotel business. However, the bank requires that the funds it advances be secured by a first charge on Company A’s premises. Company A has an existing mortgage over the property, securing a loan that has only a small amount owing. To be able to provide the new bank with the first charge it requires, Company A repays the small amount owing on its current loan, and the original lender discharges the mortgage in its favour. The mortgage agreement provides that a mortgage discharge fee is payable for this. The original loan contract stipulates a fee payable in the event of early repayment of the loan, which fee Company A incurs. 188. Neither the early repayment fee nor the mortgage discharge fee is deductible under s DB 5, because neither is expenditure incurred in borrowing money (either the first borrowing or the new borrowing). These fees are related to bringing the first borrowing to an end, because they are incurred in relation to repaying the loan early and terminating the first lender’s interest in the property subject to the mortgage. Even though it is necessary for Company A to incur the mortgage discharge fee to provide security for the new loan, the expenditure is rightly characterised as being about bringing the first borrowing to an end. 189. If the fees are consideration for or under a financial arrangement they would be taken into account under the FA rules. Example 3 190. Company B wants to expand its business and needs a loan of $150,000. Company B secures the required finance through a mortgage broker. Two of the directors of Company B guarantee the loan, and are paid guarantee fees for providing these guarantees. As a condition of the borrowing, the lender requires Company B to take out a term life insurance policy on the life of the managing director and assign the policy to the lender. The term of the life insurance policy matches the term of the borrowing, and the amount of insurance cover matches the amount outstanding on the loan. The insurance premiums are arm’s length amounts, based on such things as the amount and period of the cover, the contingencies covered, and the risk profile of the insured. Company B uses the borrowed money to purchase new equipment for its plant. Company B is not a cash basis person. 191. Company B seeks to deduct under s DB 5:  legal fees incurred in arranging the loan;  the mortgage broker’s commission;  the guarantee fees paid to the two directors for acting as guarantors; and  the life insurance premiums paid for the life insurance policy taken out on the life of the managing director. 192. The legal fees are deductible under s DB 5. A sufficient nexus exists between this expenditure and establishing the borrowing. 38 193. Company B is not a cash basis person, and is required to use a spreading method under the FA rules. The guarantee fees would be taken into account and spread under the FA rules. This is because a guarantee for a fee is a financial arrangement. The mortgage broker’s commission needs to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules, because it is consideration for a financial arrangement (the loan). This commission is payable only if the loan is actually established, so is not a non-contingent fee. 194. The life insurance premiums Company B paid for the life insurance policy taken out on the life of the managing director are not deductible under s DB 5. There is not sufficient nexus between the expenditure on the insurance policy and the obtaining of the loan. The premiums are consideration for a benefit other than the loan (ie, the rights under the policy, which will ensure the repayment of the loan should the managing director die). Therefore, expenditure on the premiums cannot be considered to be incurred “in borrowing money”. The premiums are not taken into account under the FA rules, being amounts solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. Example 4 195. Company C applies for a bank loan to purchase new machinery. As part of the loan agreement, the bank passes on the cost of its lenders mortgage insurance to Company C as a “recharge”. 196. The passed on cost of the lenders mortgage insurance is deductible to Company C under s DB 5 (unless it has to be taken into account and spread under the FA rules), because it is expenditure incurred in borrowing money used as capital in deriving income. 197.

Negative base price adjustment (4) A base price adjustment, if negative, is expenditure incurred by the person in the income year for which the calculation is made. The person is allowed a deduction for the expenditure under sections DB 6 to DB 8 (which relate to deductions for interest) or, if none of those sections applies, under section DB 11 (Negative base price adjustment).

Absolute value threshold (2) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(a)(ii), this subsection applies if, on every day in the income year, the absolute value of all financial arrangements to which the person is a party added together is $1,000,000 or less. The value of each arrangement is,— (a) for a fixed principal financial arrangement, its face value: (b) for a variable principal debt instrument, the amount owing by or to the person under the financial arrangement: (c) for a financial arrangement to which the old financial arrangements rules apply, the value determined under those rules. Deferral threshold (3) For the purposes of section EW 54(1)(b), this subsection applies if the result of applying the formula in subsection (4) to each financial arrangement to which the person is a party at the end of the income year and adding the outcomes together is $40,000 or less.

Solomon Islands income tax is imposed on “chargeable income”, which is a similar concept to “taxable income” under the New Zealand Act. Income tax for employees is collected under the Solomon Islands PAYE system. Not a penalty. Solomon Islands income tax is not a penalty. Not a service charge or licence fee.

Consolidate d rson e yed ge, el. to e d 37 Intended for a public purpose (although it is irrelevant whether it is tagged for a specific public purpose). A proportion of all NI contributions are used to help fund the NHS. A proportion is also used to fund non-contributory benefits. Use of the NHS and access to non-contributory benefits are available to everyone. There is no eligibility requirement. On this basis, the NI contributions are being used for a public purpose. However, a proportion of NI contributions are also used to fund contributory benefits. This is not a public purpose. In this instance, NI contributions are used to fund a private benefit. The foreign tax must tax “income” as defined under the Act.  Some minor variations will be acceptable. Class 1 employee NI contributions tax employment income. The New Zealand Act also taxes and collects employment income substantially the same way. Class 1 employer NI contributions and Classes 1A and 1B NI contributions do not tax income (of the employer). Class 2 NI contributions are a flat fee and not a tax on income/profits. They are payable regardless of income/profits. Class 3 NI contributions are voluntary and paid at a flat rate unrelated to income. Class 4 NI contributions tax net profits of the self-employed. The “income” that is taxed is the type of income that is taxed under the Act. 38 Calculated as a proportion of income.  The rate of the tax is not important.  Whether the tax is payable at a fixed rate or at graduated rates is not important.  This condition might still be satisfied even if the tax is not payable until a minimum income threshold is reached, or if the applicable income is capped at a certain threshold. Class 1 employee NI contributions are calculated as a proportion of income. Class 1 employer NI contributions are calculated on the basis of the employee’s income and not the employer’s. This means Class 1 employer contributions are not calculated as a proportion of income of the employer. Classes 1A and 1B NI contributions are also not calculated as a proportion of income. They are paid by the employer. Class 2 NI contributions are not calculated as a proportion of income. Class 2 NI contributions are calculated at a flat rate of £2.65 per week. Class 3 NI contributions are voluntary and usually made because the person is not earning any income. They are imposed at a flat rate and therefore not calculated as a proportion of income. Class 4 NI contributions are calculated as a proportion of the self-employed person’s profits. Imposed on taxable or net income.  A taxing formula designed to produce a reasonable approximation of actual net/taxable income may be acceptable.  Where a tax is imposed as a collection mechanism for income tax and is of substantially the same nature as provisional tax, PAYE, RWT or NRWT, then the requirement that the tax be imposed on taxable or net income does not need to be satisfied. Class 1 employee NI contributions are imposed on gross income and deducted from employees’ wages by the employer. In this way, they could be characterised as a collection mechanism for the NI contributions of the same nature as New Zealand PAYE and so would satisfy this requirement. Class 1 employer NI contributions and Classes 1A and 1B are not imposed on the employer’s income. Class 2 NI contributions are imposed as a flat fee. They are payable regardless of profits or losses. Class 3 NI contributions are a voluntary payment paid at a flat rate unrelated to income. Class 4 NI contributions are calculated on net profits. Net profit is broadly the same as “taxable income”. Therefore, Class 4 NI contributions would satisfy this requirement. N f N s t w a Conclus M223. co co in s a PA th Al224. w N I ex no Ca225. co (t t h di o f th th in Not a pena Not a servic fee.

Section BB 1 provides: BB 1 Imposition of income tax Income tax is imposed on taxable income, at the rate or rates of tax fixed by an annual taxing Act, and is payable to the Crown under this Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1. Sections LJ 1-LJ 5 provide: LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1) This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign-sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand; and (b) foreign income tax is not paid in a country or territory listed in schedule 27 (Countries and types of income with unrecognised tax) to the extent to which the foreign income tax is paid on the types of income listed in the schedule. When treated as assessable income (Repealed) (3) Repealed. Source of dividends (4) If a company is not resident in New Zealand, and for the purposes of a law of another territory in relation to which a double tax agreement has been made is resident in that territory, and the law imposes foreign tax, a dividend paid by the company is treated as being derived from a source in that other territory for the purposes of the double tax agreement. Double tax agreements (5) This subpart and sections BH 1 (Double tax agreements) and CD 19(1) (Foreign tax credits and refunds linked to dividends) and section 88 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as far as they are applicable, and modified as necessary, apply for the purposes of section LJ 2, as if that section were a double tax agreement. Relationship with section YD 5 (6) Section YD 5 (Apportionment of income derived partly in New Zealand) applies to determine how an amount is apportioned to sources outside New Zealand. LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. Limitation on amount of credit (2) The amount of the person's credit in subsection (1) must not be more than the amount of New Zealand tax payable by the person in relation to the segment calculated under section LJ 5(2), modified as necessary under section LJ 5(4). Amount adjusted (3) The amount of the person’s credit in subsection (1) may be reduced or increased if either section LJ 6 or LJ 7 applies. When person both resident in New Zealand and another country 42 (4) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) who has, because they are a citizen or resident of, or are domiciled in, a foreign country, paid foreign income tax on their assessable income, has a credit under subsection (1). However, the amount of the credit is limited to the amount of foreign income tax that would have been paid in the foreign country if the person were treated as not a citizen or resident of, or domiciled in, that foreign country. Multi-rate PIEs and their investors (5) For a multi-rate PIE and an investor in a multi-rate PIE, the amount of a tax credit is limited to the extent allowed under subpart HM (Portfolio investment entities). When subsection (7) applies (6) Subsection (7) applies to a person who derives an amount from an attributing interest in a FIF when the amount is treated as not being income under section EX 59(2) (Codes: comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, fair dividend rate method, and cost method). Tax credit (7) The person has a tax credit under this subpart for foreign income tax paid on or withheld in relation to the amount. The calculation of the maximum amount of the tax credit is made under section LJ 5(2), modified so that the item segment in the formula is the amount of FIF income from the attributing interest that the person derives in the period referred to in section EX 59(2). LJ 3 Meaning of foreign income tax For the purposes of this Part, foreign income tax means an amount of income tax of a foreign country. LJ 4 Meaning of segment of foreign-sourced income For the purposes of this Part, a person has a segment of foreign-sourced income equal to an amount of assessable income derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature. LJ 5 Calculation of New Zealand tax What this section does (1) This section provides the rules that a person must use to calculate the amount of New Zealand tax for an income year in relation to each segment of foreign-sourced income of the person that is allocated to the income year. Calculation for single segment (2) If the person has a notional income tax liability of more than zero, the amount of New Zealand tax for the income year relating to the allocated segment is calculated using the following formula, the result of which cannot be less than zero: . (segment – person’s deductions) person’s net income Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula in subsection (2),— (a) segment is the amount of the segment of foreign-sourced income for the income year: (b) person's deductions is the amount of the person's deduction for the tax year corresponding to the income year that is attributable to the segment of foreign-sourced income: (c) person's net income is the person's net income for the tax year corresponding to the income year under section BD 4(1) to (3) (Net income and net loss): (d) notional liability is the person's notional income tax liability for the income year under subsection (5). When subsection (4B) applies (4) Subsection (4B) applies for the income year when the total amount of New Zealand tax for all segments of foreign-sourced income of the person calculated under subsection (2) is more than the notional income tax liability. Modification to results of formula for single segment x notional liability 43 (4B) Each amount of New Zealand tax calculated under subsection (2) in relation to each segment of foreign-sourced income is adjusted by multiplying the amount by the following ratio: Person’s notional income tax liability NZ tax Definition of item in formula (4C) In the formula in subsection (4B), NZ tax is the amount given by adding together the result of the calculation under subsection (2), for each segment of assessable income from all sources, including assessable income sourced in New Zealand. Person’s notional income tax liability (5) For the purposes of this section, a person’s notional income tax liability for a tax year is calculated using the formula— (person’s net income − losses) × tax rate. Definition of items in formula (6) In the formula in subsection (5),— (a) person’s net income is the person’s net income for the tax year: (b) losses— (i) is the amount of the loss balance carried forward to the tax year that the person must subtract from their net income under section IA 4(1)(a) (Using loss balances carried forward to tax year): (ii) must be no more than the amount of the person's net income: (c) tax rate is the basic rate of income tax set out in schedule 1, part A (Basic tax rates: income tax, ESCT, RSCT, RWT, and attributed fringe benefits). 2. Section YA 1 defines “income tax”, “tax” and “taxable income” to mean: income tax means income tax imposed under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax) except to the extent to which it has a different meaning under section YA 2 (Meaning of income tax varied) tax means income tax, but in the provisions in which the term “income tax” has an extended or limited meaning, “tax” has a corresponding meaning taxable income means taxable income for a tax year calculated under section BC 5 (Taxable income) 3. Section YA 2 provides: YA 2 Meaning of income tax varied DTA and time bar provisions: ancillary tax (1) The term income tax includes ancillary tax in— (a) section BB 3(2) (Overriding effect of certain matters): (b) section BH 1 (Double tax agreements): (c) sections 107A to 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. DTA provisions: tax recovery agreements (2) The term income tax includes a tax that is prescribed in a tax recovery agreement made under Part 10A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in— (a) section BB 3(2): (b) section BH 1. General tax avoidance provisions: ancillary tax (3) The term income tax includes ancillary tax, but not excluded ancillary tax, in— (a) section BB 3(1): (b) sections BG 1 (Tax avoidance) and GA 1 (Commissioner’s power to adjust): (c) the definition of tax avoidance. 44 Modified application of section GA 1 (4) When section GA 1 is applied in the case of an ancillary tax,— (a) the words “taxable income” in section GA 1(2) are treated as replaced by the words “liability to the ancillary tax”; and (b) the following paragraph is treated as added to section GA 1(5): “(e) an amount subject to the ancillary tax”. Tax of other countries (5) The term income tax, when specifically used in relation to tax of another country, whether imposed by a central, state, or local government,— (a) means a tax of substantially the same nature as income tax imposed under section BB 1 (Imposition of income tax); and (b) includes a tax, imposed as a collection mechanism for the foreign tax, that is of substantially the same nature as provisional tax, pay-as-you-earn (PAYE), resident withholding tax (RWT), or non-resident withholding tax (NRWT).  UFTC rules (Repealed) (6) (Repealed) FDP, imputation, and BETA rules (7) The term income tax, in relation to tax that has been paid by a person, includes provisional tax in— (a) the FDP rules: (b) the imputation rules: (c) subpart OE (Branch equivalent tax accounts (BETA)).

This statement updates and replaces the item “Consumable aids to manufacture or production — what they are and when to claim as a deduction” published in Public Information Bulletin No 51 (September 1969): 11 and the item “Consumable aids – deductibility of cost” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 4 (October 1995): 13. Both items deal with the income tax treatment of consumable aids. The current relevance of this information was identified during a review of content published in Public Information Bulletins and Tax Information Bulletins before 1996. The Public Information Bulletin review has now been completed, see “Update on Public Information Bulletin review” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 10 (November 2013): 37. Summary 1. Consumable aids are goods or materials that are used in the manufacture or production of goods or in the performance of services. These goods and materials are completely consumed or become unusable or worthless in a relatively short period after being applied in the process of deriving income. They do not become a component part of a finished product. Examples of consumable aids are the fertiliser used by a farmer, fuel in a car used in a business and certain short-life grinding wheels used in a mill. 2. The cost of acquiring a consumable aid is deductible when incurred in deriving income. However, if the provisions of s EA 3 apply, the expenditure incurred on consumable aids that are not used up in deriving income at the end of a person’s income year is included in that person’s income for the year. 3. Under Determination E12 a person is excused from complying with s EA 3 if they have an unexpired portion of expenditure on consumable aids of $58,000 or below at the end of the income year. To be excused from complying with s EA 3 under Determination E12, consumable aids must be in the possession of the person at balance date and the deduction of the expenditure must not have been deferred to a subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes. Analysis 4. We outline below what a consumable aid is, how the expenditure on consumable aids is deductible, when expenditure on consumable aids needs to be added back under s EA 3 and how Determination E12 applies to consumable aids. What is a consumable aid? 5. The term “consumable aid” is referred to, but not defined, in the Act. Consumable aids used in the production of trading stock are specifically excluded from the definition of “trading stock” for the trading stock valuation provisions (s EB 2(3)(g)). 6. New Zealand cases have looked at what a consumable aid is in the context of trading stock. We note that the following cases were decided when the term “consumable aid” did not appear in the relevant Income Tax Act and consumable aids were not specifically excluded from trading stock. However, we consider that these cases are still good authority on what is a consumable aid. 1 7. The consumable aid concept was referred to in Case N32 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,280. The case concerned a New Zealand manufacturing plant that was part of a group of companies owned by an overseas company. The case looked at balance date adjustments for work in progress, pre-payments and consumable aids made for the 1986 and 1987 income years. 8. Barber DJ said about consumable aids, at 3,287: \[A\] distinction is drawn in tax law between consumable aids and stock in trade. Consumable aids are articles or materials which, without becoming component parts of a finished product, are used in the manufacture or production of goods from which a taxpayer derives its assessable income, and are either completely or almost completely consumed or become unusable or worthless after being once applied in the process. What is a consumable aid varies according to the business carried on. For example, as Mr Bonnar suggested, a sack of coal is stock in trade of a coal merchant, but a consumable aid of a pottery manufacturer. I agree that each case must be considered on its own facts taking into account the nature of each item used, the extent to which the item lends itself to repetitive use, and the rate of consumption to be expected from the day to day carrying on of the enterprise of the manufacture. Generally speaking, expenditure on consumable aids is a cost of business and, therefore, such expenditure may be deducted in the year of expenditure. \[Emphasis added\] 9. In Case E98 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,522, the Taxation Review Authority had to determine whether the cost of bales of hay included in the purchase of a dairy farm was deductible. Part of the hay was sold on and part was used as stock feed on the farm. Bathgate DJ said the following about consumable aids, at 59,529: A “consumable aid” is a term recognised and used in taxation practice, although it is not referred to in the Income Tax Act 1976. “Consumable aids” are goods or produce such as cleaning agents, fuel and other aids to, and consumed in, manufacture or production. They are no more than aids or stores used or consumed in manufacture or production. Their nature and use distinguish these items from trading stock, as illustrated in 4 N.Z.T.B.R. Case 16. \[Emphasis added\] 10. In Case 16 (1968) 4 NZTBR 185, the Taxation Board of Review concluded that grinding wheels with a life of 9–24 days and furnace bricks with a life of about 2½ weeks used in a steel foundry were consumable aids and not trading stock or loose tools. The board agreed with the opinions expressed and the conclusions reached about “consumable aids to manufacture” in the earlier Australian decision Case 120 (1951) 1 CTBR (NS) 568 (discussed further below). This was on the basis that consumable aids are articles or materials that are used up in the manufacturing process, do not become a part of the goods for sale, and become unusable or worthless after one use or lend themselves to limited repetitive use. In distinguishing consumable aids from capital assets, the board summarised at 194: Each case will therefore involve a consideration not only of the nature of the item used but also of such factors as the extent to which it lends itself to repetitive use, the rate of consumption to be expected in the day-to-day carrying on of a company’s enterprise and, as a corollary to the last-mentioned consideration, whether the volume of purchases is appropriate to the proximate needs of the manufacturer concerned. 11. In Case 120, the Australian Taxation Board of Review had to decide whether certain goods were consumable aids or trading stock. The board held that chemicals, cleaning fluids and various other articles used in manufacture were consumable aids because they did not become component parts of finished products and were not goods purchased for manufacture. Taxation Board of Review member F C Bock classified the different types of goods the company had recorded under “non-trading stocks” and stated at 571: Goods (purchased by the company) which are rapidly consumed in the course of being applied in the company’s manufacturing processes but do not, to any extent, except, perhaps, adventitiously, become integral parts of the finished products. ... 2 Their nature and functions are such that nearly all of them would be used up, or become unusable and worthless, as the result of being applied once in a manufacturing process and that others (only one or two), although capable of limited repetitive use, have a very short life. Such goods are sometimes described as “consumable aids to manufacture” and I shall refer to them by that description. \[Emphasis added\] 12. At 592, F C Bock concludes that cleaning agents and other aids to manufacture recorded under “non-trading stocks” do not form part of the trading stock of the company and states: The purpose for which they \[the cleaning agents and other aids to manufacture\] were acquired was not for sale or exchange either in their existing form or in a processed form suitable for sale or exchange. They comprised materials used for purposes ancillary to the business of manufacturing goods for sale and do not form a component part of such goods produced or manufactured; at no time does possession of or property in these materials pass from the company to its customers; as consumed in the process of working up raw materials into finished goods ready for sale they constitute an expense to the company which is comparable to the losses or outgoings incurred on wages of factory employees (clerks, storemen, etc.) not directly engaged in the manufacturing process. 13. From the above cases, it can be concluded that consumable aids are goods or materials to which all of the following criteria apply: • They are used in the manufacture or production of goods or services from which a person derives income. • They are completely, or almost completely, consumed at a rapid rate, or become unusable or worthless after being once applied (in the production process), or are capable of limited repetitive use. • They are not component parts of a finished product (or goods acquired for further processing that become part of a finished product). • As opposed to capital assets, they are consumed at a rapid rate or have a very short life. What a consumable aid is varies according to the business carried on. 14. As noted above, consumable aids have been expressly excluded from the definition of “trading stock”: s EB 2(3)(g). Consumable aids are distinguishable from raw materials because consumable aids do not end up being part of the final product. Consumable aids are also generally distinguishable from spare parts because most spare parts are neither completely consumed nor become unusable or worthless in a relatively short period after being applied in the process of deriving income. How are consumable aids different from raw materials and spare parts? 15. Consumable aids are distinguishable from raw materials. Raw materials, like consumable aids, are used in the manufacturing process. However, unlike consumable aids, raw materials are acquired to become an integral part of the finished product. Raw materials are included in the definition of “trading stock” in s EB 2(2)(b): “materials that the person has for use in producing trading stock”. This means that raw materials are valued as trading stock under subpart EB. The value of a person’s trading stock at the end of each income year is income of the person in the income year (ss CH 1(2) and EB 3). 16. Spare parts are used to repair or replace components of an asset or item. Spare parts can be either trading stock or used to maintain plant that is used to derive income. Spare parts used to maint ain plant are similar to consumable aids because they are used in the production process and may not actually be absorbed into any final product. Often spare parts are used when the plant or machinery breaks down or requires maintenance. This often results in the spare parts being used for a relatively long period after being applied. For this reason, most spare parts will not meet the consumable aid requirement of being completely consumed or becoming 3 unusable or worthless in a relatively short period after being applied in the process of deriving income. 17. Section EB 2(3)(h) specifically excludes “a spare part not held for sale or exchange” from the definition of “trading stock”. The deductibility of expenditure on spare parts is determined under general principles (general deductibility in s DA 1, and general limitations in s DA 2(1) to (6)). As opposed to consumable aids, spare parts that fall under the prepayment rules in s EA 3 do not get the benefit of Determination E12. This determination is discussed further below. 18. Most spare parts will be easily distinguishable from consumable aids because they are either trading stock or are usable for a relatively long period of time after being applied. However, there may be some goods and materials that taxpayers describe as spare parts but that also fit the description of consumable aids as outlined in this statement. These spare parts are also consumable aids and Determination E12 applies accordingly. 19. The following diagram illustrates in general terms the distinction between consumable aids, raw materials and spare parts: Deductibility of expenditure on consumable aids 20. As previously mentioned, consumable aids to be used in the process of producing trading stock are specifically excluded from the definition of “trading stock” by s EB 2(3)(g). Therefore, they are not valued under the trading stock valuation provisions in subpart EB. There is no specific legislative regime or provision dealing with the deductibility of expenditure on consumable aids. Therefore the deductibility of expenditure on consumable aids must be determined by general principles under ss DA 1 and DA 2. 21. The cost of a consumable aid will usually be expenditure incurred in deriving income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. Consequently, the cost of a consumable aid will be deductible under the general permission in s DA 1(1) and the deduction will not usually be denied under the general limitations in ss DA 2(1) to (6). FUEL Raw materials Consumable aids ORE PRODUCT Trading stock Spare parts 4 Section EA 3 and consumable aids 22. While expenditure on buying consumable aids is deductible when incurred, this type of expenditure is also subject to s EA 3 (Prepayments). Section EA 3 sets out how to treat prepayments, where a prepayment is expenditure that the taxpayer has incurred and is allowed as a deduction but there is an unexpired portion of that expenditure at the end of the income year. Section EA 3(3)(a) provides that the unexpired amount of expenditure has to be added back as income in the same year under s CH 2. Section EA 3(3)(b) provides that this unexpired amount is deductible under s DB 50 in the following income year. Section EA 3 will be applied to this expenditure again at the end of the following income year if there is still an unexpired portion. 23. Section EA 3 explains what “unexpired” means for expenditure on goods, services and choses in action. In the context of consumable aids, the meaning of “unexpired” in relation to goods is relevant. For goods, an amount of expenditure is unexpired if the goods are not used up in deriving income and are not destroyed or rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income by the end of the income year. Meaning of “used up” 24. There has been some uncertainty concerning at what stage a consumable aid is “used up” in terms of s EA 3(4). The words “used up” in s EA 3(4) have their ordinary meaning in this context, being “consume or expend the whole of something” (see Concise Oxford English Dictionary, 12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011). 25. A good has been used up in terms of s EA 3(4) when it has been expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets in deriving income. The focus is on whether a good continues to exist and be available for deriving income beyond the income year. This is consistent with the policy intent of the provision and case law considering s 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976, the predecessor to s EA 3. 26. The concept of making adjustments for prepaid expenditure was first introduced into tax legislation in 1987 as part of the new timing or accrual rules. These rules were brought in “...to achieve a much closer matching of the timing of deductions and the timing of income recognition for tax purposes” (see the Minister’s preamble in the October 1986 Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure). 27. This is consistent with the Court of Appeal decision in Thornton Estates Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577. This case considered whether a land developer had to add back expenditure on sections that had undergone subdivision and substantial development work but had not sold at the end of the income year. 28. Section 104A(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976 had the word “used” instead of the words “used up”, which are in s EA 3(4). However, the court in Thornton Estates found that “used” in the context of s 104A(2)(a) did not mean goods applied or employed in the income producing process. Rather, the court found that “used” only referred to goods “used up” in the income producing process. 29. The court saw the purpose of s 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 was to “achieve a closer matching of the timing of deductions and income recognition for tax purposes”. The taxpayer was allowed the deduction when the purchased goods were “expended through being consumed or incorporated into other assets” (at 13,583). The court considered the statutory description of “unexpired portion” reinforced this by referring to that which is left. The change in wording from “used” to “used up” since Thornton Estates seems to strengthen this. 5 Consumable aids used to produce other consumable aids 30. Sometimes consumable aids are used to produce other consumable aids to be used in a business. A common example of this is home-grown stock food, where a farmer uses consumable aids, such as seeds and fertiliser, to produce silage to be used on the farm. There has been some uncertainty as to how s EA 3 applies to those types of consumable aids. 31. Section EA 3(4), as it applies to consumable aids, requires the unexpired portion of a person’s expenditure on goods to be added back, directly linking the goods and the expenditure when determining the unexpired portion that is income under s EA 3(3)(a). Section EA 3 applies in the same way in the context of consumable aids used to produce other consumable aids. That is, to determine whether an amount of expenditure on consumable aids is unexpired, the enquiry under s EA 3(3) is whether the goods have been used up in deriving income or destroyed or rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income. In the example of home-grown silage, the seeds are used up when they are planted and the fertiliser is used up with spreading. This is because they do not continue to exist as seeds and fertiliser and do not continue to be available as seeds and fertiliser. There is therefore no amount of expenditure on the planted seeds and spread fertiliser that is unexpired in terms of s EA 3. If, however, the consumable aids are used to produce trading stock (eg, stock feed to be sold), then the person has to value the produced trading stock under the trading stock valuation regime in subpart EB with the closing value of the trading stock being income under s CH 1(2). How does Determination E12 apply to consumable aids? 32. Section EA 3(8) provides the Commissioner with the discretion to excuse certain persons from complying with s EA 3. The Commissioner has used the discretion under s 91AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and issued Determination E12: Persons excused from complying with s EA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (DET E12). DET E12 specifically covers consumable aids (see row (d) of the Schedule to DET E12). 33. Under DET E12, a taxpayer does not have to add back the expenditure incurred on the purchase of consumable aids as income under s EA 3 if: • the total of the expenditure on consumable aids that is unexpired at balance date does not exceed $58,000; and • the consumable aids are in the possession of the taxpayer at balance date; and • the deduction of the expenditure has not been deferred to a subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes. 34. Under DET E12, a person is excused from complying with s EA 3 when the unexpired portion of the expenditure on all consumable aids in total is no more than $58,000 at the end of the income year. This means expenditure of $58,000 or less on the purchase of consumable aids that are not used up does not have to be added back as income of the person. However, if the unexpired portion of expenditure on the purchase of all consumable aids exceeds $58,000 at the end of the income year, the person does not get the benefit of DET E12 and s EA 3 applies to the total amount of expenditure. 35. However, DET E12 only applies to expenditure on goods (listed in the Schedule to DET E12) to the extent that the goods are in the person’s possession at balance date (see cl 4(d)) and to the extent that the deduction of the expenditure has not been deferred to a subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes (see cl 4(e)). This means that the person has to add back the expenditure for consumable aids that 6 are not in their possession at balance date. This is even if the total unexpired portion of expenditure for the purchase of consumable aids is below the threshold of $58,000. 36. This raises the question of the meaning of “possession” in DET E12 cl 4(d). The ordinary meaning of “possession” indicates that ordinarily “possession” is not equal to legal ownership and requires some form of power or control over the thing in possession. The inclusion of the words “in the”, preceding the word “possession” in cl 4(d), also suggests that possession in this context means the goods need to be in the control of the taxpayer. This view is consistent with the common law meaning of the word “possession”. The context in which the term “in the possession of” is used in DET E12, excusing the taxpayer from applying s EA 3, also supports the term “possession” having a meaning with a physical focus. 37. In the Commissioner’s view, to be “in the possession of” a consumable aid in terms of cl 4(d) requires the taxpayer to have actual physical possession of the consumable aid or to have it in the taxpayer’s close physical control so they can use it. Legal ownership is not relevant for determining whether a person is in the possession of a consumable aid in terms of DET E12. This means, for example, that consumable aids that have been ordered and paid for but have not been delivered by the supplier at balance date are not “in the possession of” the taxpayer within DET E12 cl 4(d). 38. A further requirement of DET E12 is that it will not apply to the extent that a person has deferred the deduction of the expenditure on consumable aids to a subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes. If a taxpayer has met the other requirements of DET E12 but has deferred the deduction for some or all of the consumable aids expenditure in their financial statements, they are not able to apply DET E12 to that deferred expenditure. 39. Note that the unexpired portion of all expenditure on consumable aids counts towards the $58,000 threshold in DET E12. This includes any expenditure incurred on consumable aids that are not in the person’s possession at balance date and expenditure on consumable aids that has been deferred to a subsequent income year in the person’s financial statements. Examples 40. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – “Used up” requirement in s EA 3(4) 41. Egmont Ltd operates a tannery. It purchases different salts costing $120,000 to be used in the tannery. It also purchases fuel costing $10,000 to run the machinery used in the tanning process. 42. At the end of the income year, $60,000 worth of salts is still stored in the original containers. The other salts have been added, together with other chemicals, to different solutions in vats used in the tanning process. These brines and solutions are still being used at the end of the income year. $2,000 worth of fuel is still in the storage tank it was delivered to. There is also some fuel in the machinery tanks. 43. The salts still stored in the original containers are not used up in terms of s EA 3(4) as they continue to exist and are available beyond the income year. The expenditure on these salts is therefore unexpired and income of Egmont Ltd in that income year. 44. While the brine and solutions the other salts have been dissolved into still exist and are still used beyond the income year, the dissolved salts can be considered to be used up in terms of s EA 3(4). This is because the salts themselves do not continue to exist; rather they have been incorporated into the brines and solutions. There is no unexpired portion in relation to these salts. 7 45. The fuel still in the storage tank and the fuel that is still in the machinery tanks is not used up, as it continues to exist (as fuel) and is available to be used beyond the income year. The unexpired portion of fuel is income of Egmont Ltd. A reasonable estimate may be adopted to determine the amount of fuel still in the machinery. 46. DET E12 does not apply to excuse Egmont Ltd from complying with s EA 3 as the unexpired portion for all consumable aids is over the threshold of $58,000. Egmont Ltd needs to add back as income the total cost of the unexpired portion of salts and fuel. Example 2 – Home-produced consumable aids 47. Daisy Hills Ltd produces grain on its farm as stock feed for its dairy cows. It plants the grains and spreads fertilizer while the crop is growing in 2013. To harvest the grain crops, the company uses a contractor. At the end of the 2013/14 income year, Daisy Hills Ltd has grain in storage that has not been fed to its cows yet. 48. The home-grown grain to be used as stock feed for its dairy cows is a consumable aid for Daisy Hills Ltd. However, there is no unexpired portion of expenditure that needs to be added back under s EA 3. This is because the grain seeds and the fertiliser have been used up in terms of s EA 3(4) by planting and spreading. The services of the contractor harvesting the grain crops have been performed. The expenditure on the seeds, fertiliser and the contractor are deductible in the 2013/14 income year. Example 3 – Excused from complying with s EA 3 (DET E12) 49. Maclary Ltd, a hairdressing business, buys hair care products for $20,000 during the 2012/13 income year. Most of the products are used in the salon by the hairstylists. However, some of the products are sold as retail products to customers. At the end of the income year, Maclary Ltd has $6,000 worth of hair care products intended for use by the hair stylists left in the salon. There is also $800 worth of retail hair care products intended for sale to customers left in the salon. The salon does not have any other consumable aids on hand at the end of the income year and has not deferred the deduction for the expenditure on the hair care products to the subsequent income year for financial reporting purposes. 50. The hair care products for use by the stylists are consumable aids. They are used up in the performance of hairdressing services. As the threshold in DET E12 is not exceeded, the amount of $6,000 is deductible in the 2012/13 income year. 51. The retail hair care products that Maclary Ltd has for sale to customers are not consumable aids but fall under the definition of “trading stock” in s EB 2. These retail hair care products must be valued under the trading stock valuation rules in subpart EB at the end of the income year. 52. If Maclary Ltd decides in the 2013/14 income year to sell some of the hair care products ($400 worth) that were initially intended for use by the hair stylists when they were purchased during the 2012/13 income year, Maclary Ltd will need to treat those products as trading stock under subpart EB for the 2013/14 income year. Example 4 – DET E12 threshold ($58,000) 53. Cailuna Ltd operates a paper mill. It purchases chemicals for $63,000, cleaning products for $48,000 and fuel for $52,000 during the 2012/13 income year. At the end of the income year, chemicals with a cost of $10,500, cleaning products with a cost of $40,000 and fuel with a cost of $9,000 are not used up. 54. The entire cost of the chemicals, the cleaning products and fuel is deductible in the 2012/13 income year as expenditure on consumable aids. However, because Cailuna Ltd has unused chemicals, cleaning products and fuel that in total cost $59,500, an 8 amount greater than $58,000, s EA 3 applies. Cailuna Ltd cannot rely on DET E12. This means the unexpired portion of expenditure of $59,500 must be returned as income in the 2012/13 income year. Example 5 – Not in possession at balance date and DET E12 55. Piggeldy Ltd runs a pig farm. It purchases grain for its pigs costing $40,000 just before balance date. The grain was not delivered until a week after Piggeldy’s balance date. 56. Even though Piggeldy had no other consumable aids on hand, and the unexpired portion of the grain was under the $58,000 threshold, DET E12 does not apply to excuse Piggeldy Ltd from complying with s EA 3. This is because, for DET E12 to apply to the expenditure on the grain, the grain needs to be in the possession of Piggeldy Ltd at balance date. 57. Piggeldy Ltd must return the $40,000 expenditure on the grain as income in the year in which the expenditure was incurred. However, Piggeldy Ltd is allowed a deduction for the $40,000 in the following year. Section EA 3 and DET E12 will apply again at the end of the following income year to determine whether any of the expenditure needs to be returned as income.

Before discussing these company administration costs, this statement briefly considers the principles of deductibility that underlie the analysis of the particular administration costs. This statement applies from the 2014/15 and subsequent income years, 2. contemporaneously with the commencement of amendments made by s 50 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. These amendments inserted three provisions into the Act as follows: • Section DB 63 provides that a company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in authorising, allocating, or processing the payment of a dividend or in resolving a dispute concerning these matters. • Section DB 63B provides that a listed company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred as periodic fees of a recognised exchange for maintaining the registration of the company on the exchange. • Section DB 63C provides that a company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding an annual meeting of shareholders but is denied a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding a special or extraordinary meeting of shareholders. This statement does not consider specific deductibility provisions that may apply 3. to some types of company expenditure. These include expenditure related to: • the determination of tax that may be deductible under s DB 3 (fees for return preparation, objections and litigation expenses), and • the preparation and registration of a lease that may be deductible under s DB 18. In addition, the transfer pricing rules set out in ss GC 6 to GC 14 may also apply 4. to substitute an arm’s length consideration for the expenses referred to in this statement. In many instances, each type of company administration cost will relate to a 5. variety of different outgoings. It is likely these outgoings will include composite payments for which issues of dissection or apportionment may arise. Therefore, the principles of apportionment discussed from para 36 may need to be considered in determining the tax treatment of any particular payment. SUMMARY Accounting fees associated with company administration costs The deductibility of accounting fees depends on whether the underlying 6. transaction or issue requiring the fees to be incurred is of a capital or revenue nature. For example, accounting fees relating to the acquisition of a capital asset would generally be an item of a capital nature and non-deductible. In contrast, accounting fees associated with dealing with creditors or other operational matters would be of a revenue nature and therefore deductible. 2 Audit fees Audit fees are incurred to provide shareholders and others with reliable financial 7. information. Reliable financial information enables the shareholders to exercise their power to control the company and other stakeholders to make decisions regarding their relationship with the company. The Commissioner considers audit fees are deductible because there is a sufficient 8. relationship between annual audit fees and a company’s business and the fees are not capital expenditure. Dividends Expenditure incurred in authorising, allocating, or processing the payment of a 9. dividend (including expenditure incurred in resolving a dispute in relation to these matters) is deductible for the 2014/15 and subsequent income years. Section DB 63 provides a d eduction f or this expenditure. To qualify for a deduction under s DB 63, the expenditure in question does not need to satisfy the general permission contained in s DA 1 . The deduction is also not prohibited by the capital limitation. Legal fees associated with company administration costs Like accounting fees mentioned above, the deductibility of expenditure on legal 10. fees depends on whether the underlying transaction or issue requiring the fees to be incurred is of a capital or revenue nature. F or example, legal fees relating to the acquisition of a capital asset or drafting changes to a company’s constitution would generally be items of a capital nature and non-deductible. In contrast, legal fees associated with dealing with creditors or other operational matters would be of a revenue nature and therefore deductible. However, s DB 62 overrides the capital limitation to provide a deduction for legal 11. fees that meet the general permission but would otherwise be non-deductible as capital expenditure. Section DB 62 applies where the taxpayer’s total legal expenses for an income year are equal to or less than $10,000. Listing fees A company listing with a licensed operator of a financial products market will incur 12. expenditure on the initial listing of the company’s securities plus further fees for an y subsequent listing of additional securities (referred to in this statement as “additional listing fees”). It will also incur periodic fees to maintain the company’s listing. Initial and additional listing fees are treated differently to periodic fees for income tax deductibility purposes. Listing facilitates capital raising because it enhances the marketability of a 13. company’s securities by providing liquidity to investors. The capital raised from the funds provided by shareholders subscribing to shares is a contribution to the capital structure of the company. Generally, expenditure incurred in borrowing money to raise capital is capital expenditure. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that initial listing fees and any additional 14. listing fees are not deductible because they are capital expenditure, being expenditure that facilitates the raising of capital. However, if initial listing fees or any additional listing fees are incurred in relation to debt securities, then s DB 5 or the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW of the Act may apply depending on the facts of the case (see Interpretation Statement, IS 13/03: “Income Tax - deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money - Section DB 5”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 1 (February 2014): 3). 3 In contrast, p eriodic listing fees incurred to maintain the listing of a company are 15. considered deductible under s DB 63B. Section DB 63B supplements the general permission in s DA 1 and specifically provides for the deductibility of periodic fees incurred to maintain registration of a listed company on a recognised exchange, regardless of whether the company is carrying on a business or income-earning activity. Section DB 63B also overrides the capital limitation. Share registry expenses Expenditure incurred on the maintenance of the share register is deductible where 16. a company carries on a business. The maintenance of the share register is necessary to identify the persons who are the shareholders who have the power to make decisions relating to the company’s business, such as at annual shareholder meetings. The Commissioner considers t here is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the company’s business. The expenditure is generally not capital expenditure. The expenditure is recurrent and does not result in the creation of a structural asset or enduring benefit (with the possible exception of costs incurred in relation to mergers, acquisitions or company migration). Shareholder meetings Direct expenditure incurred in holding a meeting Direct expenditure incurred in holding a meeting would include expenditure 17. incurred on: • Venue hire and any other costs related to preparation of the venue. • Equipment hire (eg, audiovisual equipment). • Refreshments provided to those attending the meeting. • Printing, publishing, postage and advertising of notices of the meeting. • Preparation of resolutions. • Travel costs for directors and other persons required to attend the meeting. • Any other costs directly related to physically holding or conducting the meeting. Such expenditure incurred in holding a meeting of shareholders is: 18. • Deductible where the expenditure is incurred in holding an annual meeting, regardless of whether the company is carrying on a business or income-earning activity and whether the expenditure is capital in nature: s DB 63C(1). • Not deductible where the expenditure is incurred in holding a special or extraordinary meeting: s DB 63C(2). Indirect expenditure incurred in relation to meetings of shareholders Indirect expenditure in relation to a meeting would be any other expenditure that 19. is incurred for, or in preparation for, a meeting of shareholders that is not a direct cost of physically holding or conducting the meeting. The tax treatment of indirect expenditure incurred for a meeting of shareholders 20. depends on the purpose of the meeting for which the expenditure was incurred. Indirect expenditure incurred for the following purposes will be deductible or 21. non-deductible as shown: 4 • Ordinary business purposes of an annual meeting – Deductible where the company is carrying on a business. • Alteration of the company’s constitution – Generally not deductible but may be in some situations (such as in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Carron Company (1968) 45 TC 18 (HL)). • Alteration of shareholders’ rights – Generally not deductible because the general permission is not met and the capital limitation applies. May be deductible where inseparable from, or ancillary or incidental to, business objectives that meet the general permission. • Arrangements with creditors – Deductible where the company is carrying on a business. • Liquidation – Not deductible because the general permission is not met and the capital limitation applies. • Major transactions under the Companies Act 1993 – Depends upon the facts. Not deductible where incurred after the company has committed to a major transaction because the capital limitation will apply. • Ratifying directors’ actions or breaches in their duty to the company – For the ratification of directors’ actions under s 177 of the Companies Act 1993, deductibility depends on the actions ratified. Expenditure incurred for the purpose of a shareholders’ meeting to ratify breaches of the directors’ duty to the company is generally deductible where the company is carrying on a business. • Takeovers (target company) – Not deductible where incurred to preserve position of existing shareholders or to obtain a benefit of a capital nature. Statutory return fees A primary reason for incurring expenditure on statutory returns, such as return 22. filing fees, is to ensure that the company remains on the register of companies. This allows the company to continue to operate as a company and meet obligations to third parties in any commercial contracts. In addition, failure to register the annual return or notices of change of the 23. company’s address for service or registered office may result in documents or notices not being sent to the company correctly . Unless it receives a notice a company may not be able to respond to actions that may be taken against the company and that may have an impact on the company’s business. In the Commissioner’s view, the commercial necessity for the expenditure 24. provides grounds for finding that expenditure on return filing fees has a sufficient relationship with the company’s business. The costs are deductible. The expenditure is not capital expenditure. The expenditure is recurrent and does not result in the creation of a structural asset. 5 Summary table of deductibility of company administration costs Company administration cost Deductibility Para Ref.

Accordingly, this statement first discusses these principles before considering (from para 43) the deductibility of each company administration cost. Principles of deductibility General permission The following discussion summarises the main aspects of the principles of 26. deductibility only. For a more detailed discussion of the general permission and the capital limitation, see the Commissioner’s Interpretation Statement, IS 10/06: “Deductibility of business relocation costs” published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 8 (September 2010): 20. To determine whether company administration costs are deductible the general 27. permission in s DA 1 must first be considered . Section DA 1 states: Nexus with income (1) A person is allowed a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss, including an amount of depreciation loss, to the extent to which the expenditure or loss is— (a) incurred by them in deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income; or (b) incurred by them in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving— (i) their assessable income; or (ii) their excluded income; or (iii) a combination of their assessable income and excluded income. General permission (2) Subsection (1) is called the general permission. Avoidance arrangements (3) Section GB 33 (Arrangements involving depreciation loss) may apply to override the general permission in relation to an amount of depreciation loss. The following principles of deductibility can be drawn from case law: 28. • For expenditure to be deductible there must be a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s income-earning process. It is a question of fact and degree in each case: CIR v Banks \[1978\] 2 NZLR 472 (CA); Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA). • Determining whether the necessary relationship exists requires considering the true character of the expenditure and its relevance to the taxpayer’s income-earning process. This includes considering the scope of the taxpayer’s income-earning process and the factual situation at the time the expenditure was incurred: Banks; Buckley & Young. • For expenditure to be deductible a particular item of expenditure need not be linked with a particular item of income. Also, income need not have been 7 produced in the year of expenditure: Commissioner of Taxation (NSW) v Ash (1938) 5 ATD 76 (HCA) at 78; Eggers v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,153 (CA). • Paragraph (b) of s DA 1(1) applies only to taxpayers who are carrying on a business. In contrast to s DA 1(1)(a), under s DA 1(1)(b) expenditure need not be directly related to the derivation of income but is deductible when incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. This permits a broader approach: • To be expenditure incurred in carrying on a business, the expenditure must be incurred as part of the taxpayer’s business operations to obtain assessable income: FCT v Wells 71 ATC 4,188 (HCA); John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FCT (1959) 101 CLR 30 (HCA). • Whether expenditure has a sufficient relationship to the taxpayer’s business operations is usually determined from objective matters. However, subjective matters may be relevant where the expenditure was incurred by choice and the relationship between the expenditure and the business operations is more indirect and remote: Banks at 477; Magna Alloys & Research Pty Ltd v FCT 80 ATC 4,542 (FCAFC) at 4,548, 4,558–4,559; Fletcher v FCT 91 ATC 4,950 (H CA) at 4,957; Putnin v FCT 91 ATC 4,097 (FCAFC); Schokker v FCT 99 ATC 4,504 (FCAFC). • Longer-term objectives can be considered. A deduction is permitted for expenditure incurred to protect or advance a business or to avoid or reduce expenditures: Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No 2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 (CA) at 61,196–61,197; Cox v CIR (1992) 14 NZTC 9,164 (HC) at 9,168. Capital limitation If company administration costs meet the general permission, then whether any 29. of the general limitations of s DA 2 apply to deny a deduction must also be considered. The general limitations of s DA 2 override the general permission (s DA 2(7)). Of particular relevance to company administration costs are the private and capital limitations. The capital limitation in s DA 2(1), which will be considered first, states: A person is denied a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a capital nature. This rule is called the capital limitation. To decide whether the capital limitation applies, the various tests the courts have 30. formulated for determining whether expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be considered. The approach of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v FCT \[1965\] 3 All ER 209 (PC) has been described as being the governing approach for distinguishing between capital and revenue receipts or expenditure. This approach has recently been endorsed again in New Zealand by the High Court in TrustPower Ltd v CIR \[2013\] NZHC 2,970, (2013) 26 NZTC ¶21–047. In BP Australia, Lord Pearce considered that the solution was not to be found by 31. any rigid test. He considered it is derived from the whole set of circumstances, some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One circumstance, pointing in one direction, may dominate other vaguer circumstances pointing in the contrary direction. What is required is a common-sense appreciation of all the guiding features. Where the categories of capital and revenue are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary line it may not be necessary to apply all the tests: CIR v L D Nathan & Co \[1972\] NZLR 209 (CA). The courts have identified seven tests to assist in determining whether 32. expenditure is capital or revenue in nature. They are summarised as follows: 8 • The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure. This important test focuses on the principal reason or need for incurring the expenditure. It can form the basis for applying other tests: Birkdale Service Station Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 (CA); Carron. • Whether the expenditure is recurrent in nature. This involves considering whether the expenditure is recurrent (suggesting a revenue outlay) or a once and for all payment (suggesting a capital outlay): Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes) (1910) 5 TC 529 (CtSess) at 536; W Nevill and Co Ltd v FCT (1937) 4 ATD 187, (1937) 56 CLR 290 (HCA); BP Australia; Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 5 ATD 87, (1938) 61 CLR 337 (HCA). • Whether the expenditure is sourced from fixed or circulating capital. Fixed capital is what an owner turns to profit by keeping it in their possession. Circulating capital is that which comes back as part of the trading operations. A fixed capital source suggests a capital outlay: BP Australia; John Smith & Son v Moore (Inspector of Taxes) \[1921\] 2 AC 13 (HL); Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,017 (HC); CIR v Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,834 (HC). • Whether the expenditure creates an identifiable asset. Where an asset of a capital nature has been acquired or where money is spent on improving the asset, making it more advantageous or getting rid of a disadvantageous asset, the expenditure will be on capital account: Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801 (HL); CIR v McKenzies (1988) 10 NZTC 5,223 (CA). • Whether the expenditure is a once and for all payment producing assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit. Expenditure will be regarded as capital where it brings into existence an asset or advantage for the enduring benefit of the business: British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1925\] All ER Rep 623 (HL) at 629; Anglo-Persian Oil Co Ltd v Dale (1931) 16 TC 253 (KB) at 262; McKenzies. • How the expenditure is treated under ordinary principles of commercial accounting: FCT v James Flood Pty Ltd (1953) 88 CLR 492 (HCA); Broken Hill Theatres Pty Ltd v FCT (1952) 85 CLR 423 (HCA). • Whether the expenditure is on the business structure or business process. This test focuses on the distinction between expenditure on the business structure set up to earn profit (capital), and regular expenditure on the process by which regular returns are obtained (revenue): Buckley & Young at 61,274; Sun Newspapers; Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 (HCA); Anglo-Persian Oil; Fullers Bay of Islands Ltd. Many of the above tests will overlap and some factors will carry more weight than 33. others in given circumstances. Therefore, while these tests are a useful guide, a final judgement of whether the expenditure is capital or revenue in nature must be made by analysing the facts as a whole and weighing up which factors carry the most weight in light of these facts. Generally, no case will be decided under one test. Private limitation The Taxation Review Authority has considered several times whether a company 34. can incur expenditure subject to the private limitation where the expenditure is for the private benefit of a shareholder or employee. See, for instance: Case L31 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,188; Case L89 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,508; Case M82 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,484. 9 However, none of these decisions considered company administration costs. The 35. Commissioner considers it unlikely that company administration costs will be incurred for the private benefit of a shareholder or employee. Therefore, the private limitation is not relevant to the issue of whether company administration costs are deductible under the Act. Apportionment Section DA 1 allows a deduction for expenditure “to the extent to which” it is 36. incurred in deriving income and so expressly contemplates apportionment: Banks (at 476-477). In Banks, Richardson J drew a distinction between dissecting and apportioning 37. expenditure. This distinction was drawn from the Australian High Court decision of Ronpibon Tin NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 at 59. Where expenditure has distinct and severable deductible and non-deductible components it can be divided or dissected. This occurs where the distinct and severable components can be related to differing tax treatments, such as assessable and non-assessable income or to revenue and capital or private expenditure. Dissection would be possible for a composite amount that relates to, say, an itemised invoice, or to several things or services with discrete parts. In contrast, where a single outlay serves two or more objects indifferently, 38. dissection is impractical. Here, apportionment on a fair and reasonable basis (such as time, area or some other quantifiable basis), applies. The court noted in Ronpibon Tin that entire sums, such as directors’ fees, are not normally able to be dissected so are subject to apportionment. Richardson J also drew a distinction between two circumstances where dissection 39. or apportionment would either apply or not apply: Buckley & Young at 489 (citing Anglo-Persian Oil at 139- 140). One was where a payment secures two advantages, one of which is merely ancillary to the other and does not affect the true character of the payment. Deductible expenditure with some ancillary non-deductible object remains entirely deductible based on its true character (and vice versa). In these circumstances, dissection or apportionment does not apply. The second circumstance was where a payment serves more than one distinct and separately identifiable advantage or outcome, in which case it should be subject to dissection or apportionment. This distinction can be seen in Christchurch Press Company Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 40. NZTC 10,206 (HC). In Christchurch Press, Gallen J considered that although there may be more than one reason for making a payment, the principal reason for a payment determined the nature of the expenditure. Therefore, the court considered that wages of employees who were engaged in installing a capital asset did not cease to be capital expenditure, even though there may have been a secondary revenue-related reason for the expenditure of improving the production of the newspaper. So, where a payment secures dual outcomes a need for apportionment may arise. However, if one outcome is ancillary or incidental to the principal outcome, the principal outcome will determine the nature of the expenditure. In Buckley & Young, Richardson J commented that the appropriate basis for 41. apportionment of expenditure will depend on the circumstances. At 61,282 Richardson J acknowledged that there may be cases where it is difficult or impossible to determine the amount that is attributable to each advantage (particularly where each advantage is intangible and there is no obvious basis for apportionment). However, he considered that such a situation is likely to be rare and the mere fact that apportionment might be difficult would not of itself be reason for failing to formulate an answer. 10 In summary, the following can be drawn from case law regarding apportionment: 42. • Apportionment issues arise because expenditure is deductible under s DA 1 “to the extent to which” it is incurred in deriving income: Banks. • Apportionment encompasses situations where undivided items of expenditure can either be dissected or not: Banks; Ronpibon Tin. • Dissection can apply where the expenditure relates to distinct and severable parts divisible between those parts that give rise to deductible expenditure and those parts that do not. • Where the expenditure serves both deductible and non-deductible objects at the same time, dissection may not be possible and a fair and reasonable assessment must be made of the extent of the relationship between the expenditure and deductible objects. • Apportionment is not required where the expenditure has some incidental non-deductible object and the true character of the expenditure remains deductible: Buckley & Young; Christchurch Press. • The most appropriate way of apportioning expenditure depends on the circumstances of the case but practical difficulties alone in determining how apportionment should apply does not mean apportionment should not be made: Buckley & Young. Deductibility of company administration costs While company administration costs are discussed below as distinct costs, in some 43. instances each cost will encompass a range of different outgoings falling under the one head. It is likely these outgoings will include composite payments for which issues of dissection or apportionment may arise. Therefore, in the context of the deductibility of company administration costs, the 44. “importance of identifying the true character of the outgoing for which the deduction is sought” (Buckley & Young) should be borne in mind. In addition, the principles of apportionment discussed above may need to be considered in determining the tax treatment of any particular payment. Accounting fees associated with company administration costs Accounting fees do not of themselves create a category of deductible expenditure. 45. The correct tax treatment of accounting fees depends on whether the underlying transaction or issue requiring the fees to be incurred is of a capital or revenue nature. In Case Y17 (2008) 23 NZTC 13,171 there was an underlying assumption that 46. accountancy fees incurred for the preparation of annual financial accounts and tax returns by a company operating a business were deductible. At issue was the timing of the deduction and the Taxation Review Authority found that the fees were deductible in the year the accountancy services were performed. This assumption also underlies s EA 3 . Section EA 3 provides rules affecting the 47. timing of deductible expenditure. Determination E12 Persons excused from complying with section EA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides exemptions from compliance with s EA 3. The Determination includes an exemption for “mandatory accounting costs” incurred for the purpose of meeting statutorily imposed information requirements. Such costs are exempted on the presumption they would otherwise be deductible and potentially subject to s EA 3. 11 Other examples of deductible accounting fees are those associated with dealing 48. with creditors or other operational matters relating to a business. In contrast, accounting fees relating to the acquisition of a capital asset will 49. generally be an item of a capital nature and non-deductible. In Case K50 (1988) 10 NZTC 411 accounting costs incurred by the taxpayer to investigate whether to purchase a veterinary practice were found to be capital costs and as such were not deductible. The Authority considered the accounting costs related to the taxpayer's business structure and were not incurred as a revenue item in gaining or producing assessable income. Another example is the Australian decision in Case E29 73 ATC 241, which 50. concerned a company that was incorporated after preliminary studies into establishing a large industrial enterprise were favourable. However, an overseas promoter ultimately withdrew from the project and the enterprise was not established. The company had incurred substantial expenses, including legal and accounting expenses, over several years. The Board held that all the expenses in curred were losses or outgoings of a capital nature for the purpose of establishing a “profit-yielding subject” and so were not deductible. Audit fees The Companies Act 1993 requires some companies to appoint an auditor. An 51. annual audit of a company’s accounts is generally sought because the ownership of the company is separate from the management of the company. An audit is necessary to ensure that the financial accounts prepared by the directors accurately reflect the company’s financial position. This protects the company from the consequences of errors in the accounts and provides shareholders with reliable financial information. Reliable financial information enables the shareholders to monitor the performance of the directors. Others who rely on the accuracy of audited financial statements include the providers of goods or services to a company (such as general trade creditors and financiers). Also, as a matter of practice, a company will generally be required to supply financial statements to its financiers on a regular basis. Not every company that is carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining 52. income will be required to appoint an auditor. However, in practice, audit fees will generally be incurred only by companies that are carrying on a business and are required to report trading results either to their shareholders or financiers. As the function of the audit is to disclose the company’s business to its shareholders or financiers, there are strong grounds for finding that such expenditure has the necessary relationship with the business carried on by the company. Where a company has the option not to appoint an auditor but elects to do so, the appointment will generally be dictated by business ends, such as a requirement to report the business operations to shareholders or third parties with an interest in the company. Treating audit fees as a deductible expense is consistent with the UK decision of 53. Caparo Industries plc v Dickman \[1990\] 1 All ER 568 (HL) in which Lord Oliver said at 583: It is the auditors’ function to ensure, so far as possible, that the financial information as to the company's affairs prepared by the directors accurately reflects the company's position in order, first, to protect the company itself from the consequences of undetected errors or, possibly, wrongdoing (by, for instance, declaring dividends out of capital) and, second, to provide shareholders with reliable intelligence for the purpose of enabling them to scrutinise the conduct of the company's affairs and to exercise their collective powers to reward or control or remove those to whom that conduct has been confided. The discussion in Caparo suggests there is a relationship between the auditing of 54. a company’s accounts and the company’s business because it would not be 12 possible for a company to make appropriate decisions as to the use of its funds if its accounts were not accurate. The Canadian Exchequer Court in British Columbia Power Ltd v MNR 66 DTC 5,310 also considered that audit fees were deductible. Support for treating audit fees as deductible can also be found in Worsley Brewery Co Ltd v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1932) 17 TC 349 (CA) and Rushden Heel Co Ltd v Keene (Inspector of Taxes) (1948) 30 TC 298 (KB). In addition, Canadian cases have taken a broader interpretation of expenses 55. incurred for the purpose of gaining income from a business. These cases establish that a company’s expenses in communicating with its shareholders can be considered a necessary part of carrying on business through a company and that those communications can be part of the process of earning business income. These cases include British Columbia Power Corporation v MNR 67 DTC 5,258 (SCC) and Boulangerie St-Augustin Inc v The Queen 95 DTC 164 (TaxCC). The Commissioner considers that one aspect of communicating with shareholders will be ensuring the accuracy of the information via the audit process. In the Supreme Court of Canada case of British Columbia Power, the court had to 56. consider the deductibility of legal expenses incurred in a court action to defend a company’s title to shares in a subsidiary that were to be expropriated by the government. In addition, certain expenses were incurred for communicating with shareholders to inform them of the expropriation and ensuing developments. The court found that expenditure incurred in relation to communicating with shareholders was a deductible expense. The court considered that, as shareholders hold the ultimate control of a company and the power of shareholders to determine a company’s policy could not be properly exercised unless they are informed periodically of its affairs, the reasonable furnishing of such information is properly part of the company’s business. Referring to British Columbia Power (SCC), the Tax Court in Boulangerie also 57. considered that a company must communicate regularly with its shareholders as part of the process of earning business income. The court considered that the expenses in communicating with shareholders and share transfer costs were inherent in the management of every business corporation and were part of the general administration expenses that every company must incur to earn business income. Such expenditure was a legitimate expense made in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The court did not accept that the expenditure was incurred to preserve the 58. existing shareholders’ positions as owners of the company. Neither was it incurred to obtain any enduring benefit, such as additional funds or the expansion of the company’s business. Any enduring benefit, in the form of the advancement of the company’s long-term interests, was a secondary consequence of the expenditure. As a result, the expenditure incurred was not capital expenditure. The decision was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal (The Queen v Boulangerie St-Augustin Inc 97 DTC 5,012 (FCA) ). On the basis of the above approach by the courts, audit fees are deductible where 59. a company carries on a business. The provision of accurate information to shareholders on the company’s financial position is essential to enable the shareholders to exercise their power to control the company and for other stakeholders to make decisions regarding their relationship with the company. The auditing of the company’s accounts is undertaken to ensure that financial information can be relied on. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that audit fees are revenue expenditure 60. because the fees are: 13 • an on-going annual cost; • generally incurred where there is a need to report trading results to shareholders and financiers; • incurred to accurately inform shareholders of those trading results to allow the shareholders to exercise their power of control over the company; and • incurred to help protect the company from the consequences of undetected errors and wrongdoing. The Commissioner also considers that audit fees are not capital expenditure. The 61. need or occasion for such expenditure is to report trading results. The expenditure does not create an identifiable asset or an enduring benefit for the company. It is a recurrent annual expense, most likely funded out of circulating capital, and is treated as a revenue expense under ordinary accounting principles. Therefore, overall, the expenditure has the character of a revenue expense. Dividends Expenditure incurred in paying dividends is deductible for the 2014/15 and 62. subsequent income years. This is provided by s DB 63, which allows a company a deduction for expenditure incurred in authorising, allocating, or processing the payment of a dividend. Section DB 63 also provides a deduction for expenditure incurred in resolving a dispute concerning authorising, allocating, or processing the payment of a dividend. Section DB 63 supplements the general permission contained in s DA 1, meaning 63. the general permission does not need to be satisfied to achieve a deduction. Also, the limitation on deducting capital expenditure does not apply. Section DB 63 states: DB 63 Expenses in paying dividends Deduction (1) A company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in— (a) authorising, allocating, or processing, the payment of a dividend: (b) resolving a dispute concerning a matter referred to in paragraph (a). Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply. In the Commissioner’s opinion, s DB 63 provides a deduction for all expenses 64. usually encountered by a company in paying dividends. Legal fees associated with company administration costs Legal fees do not of themselves create a category of deductible expenditure. 65. Similar to accounting costs, discussed from para 45, the correct tax treatment of legal fees associated with company administration costs will depend on the purpose for which such services have been employed. As stated by Dixon J in Hallstroms at 647: The claim is to deduct legal expenses, and legal expenses, we may assume, take the quality of an outgoing of a capital nature or of an outgoing on account of revenue from the cause or the purpose of incurring the expenditure. We are, therefore, remitted to a consideration of the object in view when the legal proceedings were undertaken, or of the situation which impelled the taxpayer to undertake them. Accordingly, if the underlying cause or purpose for incurring the legal fees is 66. deductible in nature, the fees will also be deductible. If the cause or purpose is capital in nature, the fees will not be deductible. 14 However, s DB 62 may allow a deduction for some legal expenses despite the 67. underlying cause or purpose being capital in nature. Section DB 62 provides that a deduction is allowed for legal expenses that are deductible under the general permission but are of a capital nature and total, for an income year, $10,000 or less. Section DB 62 specifically overrides the capital limitation, but the general permission and other general limitations still apply. Legal expenses are defined for s DB 62 as fees for legal services (as defined in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) provided by a person who holds a practising certificate issued by the New Zealand Law Society or an Australian equivalent. Where the total legal expenses for an income year exceed the $10,000 limit, then the legal expenses must be treated in the normal way as described above. Listing fees A company may enter into a listing agreement with the operator of a financial 68. products market licensed under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013: s 327. Usually, an initial listing fee is payable for admission to the market and listing of financial products. Additional listing fees are payable for any subsequent listing of additional financial products. Companies that have listed also pay a periodic fee to remain listed. Whether listing fees are deductible depends on whether the fees incurred are periodic listing fees or whether they are initial or additional listing fees. These two types of fees are considered separately below. Initial and additional listing fees To determine whether initial and additional listing fees are deductible, the true 69. character of the advantage sought or obtained by a company from listing must be identified (Buckley & Young). Listing a company’s shares or debt securities facilitates capital raising because it enhances the marketability of a company’s securities by providing liquidity to investors. Another advantage of listing is that it raises the profile of the company and its brands. It can also aid a company’s ability to attract and retain senior employees through the use of share options and the use of its shares as currency for mergers and acquisitions. Viney, in McGrath’s Financial Institutions, Instruments and Markets ( 5th ed, 70. McGraw-Hill, Sydney, 2007), states at para 5.3: Listing on a stock exchange provides access to a large equity capital market that is not available to an unlisted business entity. Access to this market enables a listed corporation to extend the funding base on which it can expand and grow its business activities into the future. Also ... shares issued by listed companies are very liquid; that is, they can easily be sold through a stock exchange, and therefore are an attractive investment option for investors. Another advantage of listing for a corporation is that it raises its profile in the financial markets and in the markets for its products and services. A publication by NZX Ltd, From Good to Great, Book One: The story of listing with 71. NZX (New Zealand Exchange Ltd, October 2006), at 17, explains that listing provides access to additional capital after the initial capital raising through secondary capital raising options (including new issues to existing shareholders, placement or subsequent public offerings). It also suggests how listing on the market could raise a company’s profile and brand leverage at 35: The day of listing can be a great PR opportunity for your firm should you choose to publicise it. This is because interest in your company will be at its highest – and naturally, media attention will follow. Having the media interested in your company will grow your reputation and image and sharpen your competitive advantage. The benefit is that it will be easier for you to naturally attract new customers and suppliers as well as improving your company’s creditworthiness in the eyes of banks and suppliers, who can rely on the release of publicly available information for analysis. Ongoing, the fact that the public now hold an interest and ownership stake in your company presents you with a unique marketing opportunity. With disclosure obligations, you will be re quired to make regular public announcements and the media will take a more active interest 15 in your business. Generally, the more information in the public domain, the more the media will follow your brand. As mentioned, listing on the market raises the profile of a company and its 72. brands. In other words, listing helps build a company’s goodwill. Goodwill has been defined as “the attractive force which brings in custom”: Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Muller & Co’s Margarine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217 (HL). Goodwill is generally regarded as an asset of a capital nature, so that expenditure 73. relating to the acquisition of goodwill is capital expenditure: CIR v L D Nathan & Co Ltd; Buckley & Young. Goodwill can be built up by expenditure to generate brand, product and business name recognition that helps to generate revenue. Though goodwill is a capital asset of a business, it is frequently earned and maintained by the daily activities of those engaged in the business. The valuable, if intangible, asset of goodwill frequently grows out of activities for which the cost is a charge on revenue account. Expenditure that results in the creation of goodwill would not cease to be expenditure of a revenue nature merely because such expenditure enables goodwill to be earned or maintained. However, listing fees are paid principally to facilitate the acquisition of additional capital (that is, an advantage of a capital nature). Funds provided by shareholders subscribing to shares are a contribution to the 74. capital structure of the company: FCT v The Midland Railway Co of Western Australia (1952) 85 CLR 306 (HCA). Also, expenditure incurred in borrowing money to raise capital is generally capital expenditure: Texas Land & Mortgage Co v Holtham (Surveyor of Taxes) (1894) 3 TC 255 (QB); New Zealand Dairy-Farm Mortgage Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxes \[1941\] NZLR 83 (CA); Case E1 73 ATC 1; Montreal Coke and Manufacturing Co v MNR \[1944\] 1 All ER 743 (PC); Ure v FCT 80 ATC 4,264 (NSWSC); CIR v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9,180 (CA). The initial and additional listing fees are paid for the same purpose, the listing of 75. the company’s securities. The advantage sought or obtained from the initial and additional listing fees is the facilitation of the raising of capital, whether equity or debt. Equity funding is fixed capital. Generally, debt funding is also fixed capital. Therefore, initial and additional listing fees (whether relating to listing equity or debt securities) will generally be capital expenditure on the basis that it is paid to facilitate the obtaining of fixed capital. There are circumstances where expenditure incurred in borrowing money is 76. revenue expenditure. This will be so where a taxpayer is in the business of borrowing and lending money and the borrowed money is borrowed for on-lending in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business: Scottish North American Trust v Farmer (Surveyor of Taxes) \[1912\] AC 118 (HL); Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation v MNR 71 D TC 5,409 (FCTD); AVCO Financial Services Ltd v FCT 82 ATC 4,246 (HCA); Coles Myer Finance Ltd v FCT 93 ATC 4,214 (HCA). Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the initial and additional listing fees 77. are a cost of raising capital. The advantage obtained from listing is the facilitation of both the initial capital raising and the raising of additional capital by the issue of further securities. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, initial and additional listing fees are not deductible on account of being capital expenditure. However, the implications of s DB 5 and the financial arrangements rules need to 78. be considered in the context of initial and additional listing fees for debt securities. Those matters are set out briefly below. For a comprehensive discussion of s DB 5, including the implications of the financial arrangements rules in this context, see Interpretation Statement, IS 13/03: “Income Tax – deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money – Section DB 5”. 16 Section DB 5 and financial arrangements rules Paragraph 12 of IS 13/03 states: 79. Section DB 5 allows a person a deduction for expenditure incurred “in borrowing money that is used as capital in deriving their income”. For expenditure to be deductible under s DB 5, the: • expenditure must be incurred by the taxpayer; • expenditure must be incurred in borrowing money; and • the taxpayer must use the borrowed money as capital in the derivation of their income. A deduction is allowable under s DB 5 for expenditure incurred as a transaction 80. cost in borrowing money where that expenditure would otherwise be capital expenditure. To be expenditure incurred in borrowing money, the expenditure must be incurred under a contractual obligation entered into in connection with the establishment of a loan: Ure; Brown v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,385 (HC); MNR v Yonge-Eglinton Building Ltd 74 DTC 6,180 (FCA). Initial and additional listing fees for debt securities may form part of the 81. consideration arising under a financial arrangement subject to the financial arrangements rules of subpart EW. If applicable, the financial arrangements rules will take precedence over s DB 5 in determining the deductibility of the fees: s EW 2. Whether initial or additional listing fees for debt securities are deductible under s DB 5 or fall under the financial arrangements rules will depend on the particular circumstances. Periodic listing fees Unlike initial or additional listing fees, periodic listing fees are not directly related 82. to the raising of particular funds. The true character of the advantage sought or obtained by a company from incurring periodic listing fees is to maintain the advantages that the initial or additional listing fees have secured. Where a listed company incurs periodic listing fees in the course of carrying on a 83. business for the purpose of deriving income, the Commissioner considers that, unlike the initial or additional listing fees, the periodic listing fees are deductible under the general permission in s DA 1 and are not capital expenditure. This conclusion has been confirmed and expanded upon for the 2014/15 and 84. subsequent income years. The deductibility of periodic listing fees is now dealt with by a specific provision in the Act: s DB 63B. Section DB 63B supplements the general permission in s DA 1, overrides the capital limitation and provides a deduction for expenditure incurred on periodic fees of a recognised exchange. Accordingly, all companies, whether or not they are carrying on a business or income-earning activity, are able to deduct periodic listing fees under s DB 63B. Generally, licensed markets under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 will be a “recognised exchange” as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section DB 63B states: DB 63B Periodic company registration fees Deduction (1) A listed company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred as periodic fees of a recognised exchange for maintaining the registration of the company on the exchange. Link with subpart DA (2) This section supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. The other general limitations still apply. 17 Share registry expenses The Companies Act 1993 places companies under a duty to maintain a share 85. register. Failure to comply leaves both the directors and the company open to prosecution. The share register must contain the names and addresses of all shareholders over the last 10 years. If shares have been issued, repurchased, redeemed or transferred, the register must contain the dates of each transaction and the name of the shareholder to, or from, whom shares were transferred. A company must also make the share register available for inspection by members of the public. A share register is intended to show persons dealing with the company, such as creditors, to whom and what they have to trust: Oakes v Turquand & Harding (1867) LR 2 HL 325 at 367. The entry of a shareholder’s name on the register is prima facie evidence of legal 86. title to shares. In the absence of a register or if the register is defective, a shareholder’s title to shares may be established by other evidence: Haddow Nominees Ltd v Rarawa Farms Ltd (in liq) \[1981\] 2 NZLR 16, (1981) 1 NZCLC 98,171 (CA). For a person to receive distributions, exercise rights and be entitled to receive notice of and attend meetings, their name must appear in the share register of the company. Under the Companies Act 1993, the shareholders hold the power to make certain 87. decisions relating to the company’s business, such as the appointment or removal of directors at annual shareholder meetings. The persons who hold the power to make such decisions are the persons whose names are registered in the share register on the relevant date. The share register must be maintained to enable the company to establish who holds the power to make decisions on matters relating to the company’s business. Accordingly, a share register: • provides prima facie evidence of legal title to shares • records and discloses who the shareholders of the company are. Under the general permission in s DA 1, expenditure incurred in maintaining a 88. share registry may not immediately be regarded as having a direct connection with the derivation of a company’s income or to the carrying on of a business. Given that all companies are required to maintain a register whether or not they are carrying on a business, it is arguable that share registry expenses are not wholly dictated by business ends. These issues do not appear to have been considered by the courts of New Zealand, Australia or the United Kingdom. In the Canadian case of Distillers Corporation Seagrams Ltd v MNR 58 DTC 1,168, 89. the Exchequer Court considered issues of apportionment concerning various items of expenditure incurred by a holding company, including what might be regarded as “share registry expenses”. These were amounts paid for the services of transfer agents and registrars of the company’s shares and dividend disbursing agents. The court considered these amounts were not deductible because they were incurred in connection with dealings with the company’s own shareholders or in connection with the administration of the capital structure of the company. However, as discussed above in paras 55 to 58 in the context of audit fees, more 90. recent Canadian cases (British Columbia Power (SCC) and Boulangerie (FCA)) have taken a broader interpretation of expenses incurred for the purpose of gaining income from a business. These cases establish that the expenses of communicating with shareholders can be considered deductible. In the earlier discussion of audit fees, the Commissioner considered that an aspect of communicating with shareholders relevant to that expense was ensuring the accuracy of the information communicated. Similarly, the Commissioner considers that another aspect of communicating with shareholders relevant to share registry expenses is the need to establish the identity and contact 18 information of the company’s shareholders. The share register identifies who the shareholders are and facilitates the company’s ability to communicate with them. The Supreme Court in British Columbia Power does not refer to Distillers. In 91. Boulangerie (Tax CC), the court considered that Distillers had been implicitly reversed by the Supreme Court in British Columbia Power. U nder the New Zealand test of deductibility, a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the taxpayer’s business or income-earning process must be established. In the Commissioner’s view, the conclusions in Bri tish Columbia Power (SCC) and Boulangerie (Tax CC) and (FCA) are consistent with the New Zealand test of deductibility. Other case law also establishes that expenditure relating to a company’s capital 92. structure and transactions with shareholders may be deductible in some circumstances: Carron; Truckbase Corporation v The Queen (2006) DTC 2,930 (TaxCC); St George Bank Ltd v FCT \[2009\] FCAFC 62, 2009 ATC ¶20-103. In each case, t he true character of the advantage sought or obtained from the expenditure must be determined. An ancillary or incidental advantage does not alter the character of a payment: Buckley & Young. Carron and the other cases suggest: 93. • The fact that expenditure relates to dealings with a company’s shareholders does not necessarily mean that the expenditure is not deductible (as in some circumstances the interests of the shareholders may be inseparable from those of the company). • The cost of meeting obligations relating to a company’s capital structure is not necessarily capital expenditure. Whether such expenditure is capital expenditure depends on whether the company obtains an advantage from the expenditure that is capital in nature. As indicated, the New Zealand courts have not considered the issue of whether 94. share registry costs have the necessary relationship to a company’s business operations. If called upon to do so, they are likely to take an approach that reflects the commercial realities of the relationship between a company and the business it carries on. Such an approach would be consistent with the findings of Richardson J in Banks at 477, where he indicated the reluctance of judges to establish hard and fast rules for the interpretation of the primary deductibility provisions: The language of s 111 \[now s DA 1(1)(b)\] is deceptively simple. The width and generality of the statutory language has posed problems for the courts and tribunals faced with applying the provisions in a practical way. There has been an understandable unwillingness in the cases to establish hard and fast rules to cover all situations in an area of the law which, so far as possible, should reflect commercial realities. In New Zealand, a company structure is a preferred structure for operating a 95. business. There are many reasons for this, such as limitation of liability, the ability to raise capital, controlling ownership and succession planning. The commercial view is that, once an entity is chosen for a business, expenditure on maintaining that entity is an administrative cost that should be regarded as necessarily incurred in carrying on its business. As a matter of good management practice, and as a practical requirement of running a business through a company structure, a company is bound to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1993 and its own constitution. In the Commissioner’s opinion, sufficient support exists for the view that, once a 96. company is chosen as the entity through which a business activity is to be carried on, generally the administrative costs of maintaining the company will meet the general permission. The reason for this view is that such expenditure will be 19 dictated by commercial necessity for the period during which the company is carrying on a business. However, even if such expenditure meets the general permission, a deduction will 97. be disallowed if it is expenditure of a capital nature. The following observations can be made regarding the tests or indicia formulated by the courts: • The need or occasion for the expenditure is to comply with statutory requirements and there is no wider object in view. Failure to comply with those requirements is an offence under the Companies Act 1993. • The identifiable asset test does not apply to share registry expenses. No asset is acquired or brought into existence. There is no improvement to an asset nor can such expenses be said to produce any enduring benefit. They can be viewed as maintenance type expenses, having been accepted as being of a revenue nature: Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd. • The expenses associated with maintaining a share registry are expenses that are recurrent and may be contrasted with the “once and for all” type of expenditure that might be regarded as being associated with bringing into existence an enduring benefit. Expenses will be incurred on an on -going or annual basis to the extent that the expenditure may be concerned with annual reports, meetings or proxies associated with such meetings. Expenses will also be incurred on maintaining the register with each change of shareholding. • The expenses incurred in relation to share registry matters relate to the income-earning structure rather than the process of earning income. However, share registry expenses do not relate to the creation, acquisition or enlargement of the permanent structure of a company and are related to maintaining its operational structure. • The most likely treatment of share registry costs under the ordinary principles of commercial accounting would be to treat them as revenue expenses, given that the expenditure does not give rise to an asset. Having regard to the various capital/revenue tests, only the test relating to 98. whether the expenditure is on the income-earning structure or income-earning process might lead to a view that the expenditure is of a capital nature. Otherwise, the tests support a finding that generally share registry expenses are on revenue account. However, some share registry expenses could possibly relate to matters that will create an enduring benefit to the company in particular situations (such as in relation to mergers, acquisitions or migrations). In such situations, the facts in each case must be considered. Shareholder meetings Introduction The powers reserved to shareholders by the Companies Act 1993 may be 99. exercised at a meeting of shareholders or by a resolution in lieu of a meeting. Shareholders must be given a reasonable opportunity at meetings to question, discuss or comment on the management of the company and they can pass a non-binding resolution relating to the management of the company. Under the Companies Act 1993, a company must have an annual meeting of shareholders but other meetings, called special meetings, are possible. An annual meeting of shareholders must be called not later than 6 months after 100. balance date and not later than 15 months after the previous annual meeting. Generally, the ordinary business of an annual meeting is to: 20 • consider the financial accounts and auditors’ report; • confirm the appointment and removal of directors and determine their remuneration; and • confirm the appointment of auditors and determine their remuneration. A special meeting of shareholders may be called at any time, either by the board, 101. by someone authorised by the constitution or by shareholders holding not less than 5% of the voting rights. The board of a company is likely to call a special meeting when there is a major transaction requiring shareholder approval or if there are constitutional matters that need to be considered. Often, the purpose of a special meeting is to consider: • alterations to the company's constitution (including alterations to shareholders' rights); • arrangements with creditors; • liquidating the company; • major transactions, as required by s 129 of the Companies Act 1993; • ratifying the actions of directors; or • matters relating to a takeover offer. Occasionally, meetings of shareholders may also arise as a result of a court order. 102. A court has the power to make a wide range of procedural orders, including ordering meetings of shareholders or any class of them be held to consider, and approve if appropriate, arrangements under Parts 14 (Compromises with creditors) and 15 (Approval of arrangements, amalgamations, and compromises by court) of the Companies Act 1993. The tax treatment of expenditure incurred for shareholder meetings is subject to 103. s DB 63C, which provides: DB 63C Meetings of shareholders Deduction (1) A company is allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding an annual meeting of the shareholders of the company to consider the affairs of the company. No deduction (2) A company is denied a deduction for expenditure incurred in holding a special or extraordinary meeting of the shareholders of the company. Link with subpart DA (3) Subsection (1) supplements the general permission and overrides the capital limitation. Subsection (2) overrides the general permission. The other general limitations still apply. Section DB 63C applies to expenditure incurred in “holding” a meeting. The 104. Commissioner considers that expenditure incurred in holding a meeting comprises only the costs directly incurred in physically holding or conducting the meeting. This is based on the meaning of “holding” or “hold”, which, according to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011), is: 9 arrange and take part in (a meeting or conversation). This means that expenditure likely to be incurred by companies for a 105. shareholders’ meeting can be divided into two categories: • Expenditure incurred in holding a meeting. 21 • Other expenditure incurred in relation to a meeting. This division is necessary because different tax treatments can apply to the two categories of costs. Direct e xpenditure incurred in holding a meeting would include costs of: 106. • Venue hire and any other costs related to preparation of the venue (eg, hire of audiovisual equipment). • Refreshments provided to those attending the meeting. • Printing, publishing, postage and advertising of notices of the meeting. • Preparation of resolutions. • Travel for directors and other persons required to attend the meeting. • Any other costs directly related to physically holding or conducting the meeting. Indirect expenditure for a meeting would be any other expenditure incurred for 107. matters to be considered or tabled at a meeting of shareholders that is not a direct cost of physically holding or conducting the meeting. This would include expenditure such as consultants’ fees or internal costs incurred in the preparation of reports to the board specifically on matters concerning the meeting. Other indirect costs could include costs relating to determining the contents of meeting agendas, reports and shareholder resolutions or polling shareholders on likely voting decisions. Direct expenditure incurred in holding a meeting The tax treatment of expenditure incurred in holding a meeting is provided for by 108. s DB 63C for the 2014/15 and subsequent income years. Accordingly, expenditure incurred in holding a meeting of shareholders is: • deductible where the expenditure is incurred in holding an annual meeting • not deductible where the expenditure is incurred in holding a special or extraordinary meeting. To qualify for a deduction under s DB 63C(1) for annual meeting costs, the 109. expenditure in question does not need to satisfy the general permission in s DA 1 . Deductibility of the expenditure is also not prohibited by the capital limitation. Indirect expenditure incurred for a meeting The tax treatment of indirect expenditure incurred for a meeting of shareholders 110. depends on identifying the true character of the advantage sought or obtained from the expenditure: Banks; Buckley & Young. This requires examining the purpose of the meeting for which the expenditure was incurred. Indirect meeting costs relating to the ordinary business purposes of an annual meeting The Commissioner considers that where the indirect expenditure was incurred for 111. the ordinary business of an annual meeting it will be deductible where the company is carrying on a business. As mentioned at para 100, the ordinary business of an annual meeting would generally include: • Considering the financial accounts and auditors report. 22 • Confirming the appointment and removal of directors and determining their remuneration. • Confirming the appointment of auditors and determining their remuneration. The Commissioner considers that the ordinary business of an annual meeting has 112. a sufficient connection with a company’s business so that the indirect meeting costs would be deductible. For instance, reporting to shareholders on the financial performance of the company should be regarded as a proper part of carrying on the company’s business: British Columbia Power (SCC); Boulangerie (Tax CC) and (FCA). The management of the business is in the hands of the directors and this requires shareholders to discuss and approve their remuneration. This requirement often originates from the carrying on of a business by the company. Generally, the power of shareholders to determine the company’s policy is exercised by appointing directors who agree with the shareholders. British Columbia Power (SCC) also supports the view that expenditure incurred to enable shareholders to exercise their power to determine the company’s policy is deductible. Also, audit fees are considered to be deductible (see discussion from para 51). It follows that expenditure incurred to appoint auditors should also be deductible, including indirect costs incurred for a meeting of shareholders to confirm their appointment and remuneration. Indirect meeting costs relating to other meeting purposes Here, the other meeting purposes considered are the: 113. • alteration of the company’s constitution; • alteration of shareholders’ rights; • making of arrangements with creditors; • liquidation of the company; • approval of major transactions under the Companies Act 1993; • ratification of directors’ actions or breaches of their duty to the company; and • consideration of takeover offers by a target company. Alteration of constitution Where expenditure is incurred to make alterations to the constitution of a 114. company, whether there is the required nexus with the carrying on of the business or income-earning activity by the company must first be established. Consistent with the approach approved in Banks, to determine whether such expenditure is deductible, it is necessary to: • consider the circumstances in which the expenditure was incurred; • identify the true nature of the advantage sought or obtained from the expenditure – this requires consideration of the commercial objective of the expenditure; and • consider whether there is a sufficient relationship between the expenditure and the company’s business or income-earning activity. In many cases, expenditure on altering a company’s constitution will not have an 115. impact on the earning of income and will relate to the distribution of income, so the necessary nexus will not be established. Also, expenditure incurred for the alteration of a company’s constitution is more likely to be capital expenditure. Such matters are related to the business entity rather than to the carrying on of a 23 business. An alteration to the constitution is a matter affecting the entity or the capital structure of the company and is expenditure that is “once and for all” rather than recurrent expenditure. Such expenditure may create some enduring benefit for the company. However, Carron shows that this may not always be the case. Carron involved a 116. company that incurred legal expenses to obtain a supplementary charter, as its original charter affected the profitability of the company’s business because: • the company’s borrowing powers were limited so that it was unable to raise sufficient finance for expansion; and • there were restrictions on the transfer of shares that made it difficult to obtain a suitable person for the position of managing director. The company’s profitability had increased following obtaining the supplementary charter. In the House of Lords, the Revenue argued that the supplementary charter 117. included provisions that were irrelevant to the company’s business operations. The House of Lords rejected that argument. Their Lordships considered that the purpose of amending the company’s constitution was to facilitate the company’s trading operations and that any constitutional amendments going beyond that purpose could be disregarded. The Revenue also argued that the expenditure was capital expenditure because it 118. secured an enduring benefit in the form of a better administrative structure and that the company’s constitution itself was a capital asset. That argument was also rejected. Lord Reid (with whom Lord Morris agreed) considered that the advantage obtained from the expenditure was of a revenue nature, in that it enabled the company’s business to be carried on more efficiently and to be financed more easily. Lord Guest considered that the advantage obtained was of a revenue character as the removal of restrictions in the original charter enabled the company’s day-to-day business to be carried on more efficiently. The advantages gained from the expenditure were in the nature of repair and modernisation of the trading machinery. Truckbase Corporation v The Queen is another case where the necessary nexus 119. was established. In Truckbase, the taxpayer had incurred legal and accounting fees for the redrafting of unanimous shareholder agreements that were the means by which the shareholders could limit the powers of the directors. The agreements had t he same function as a constitution. The revision of these agreements took operational powers away from the shareholders and gave it to the managers. McArthur J accepted that the revision of the agreements made the company more profitable as it gave employees the motivation to become an integral part of the business. His Honour considered that the costs were incurred for the purpose of a business reorganisation that facilitated effective management, good governance and protection for the company against any disruption due to the disability of key shareholder-employees. Therefore, the court held that the fees were incurred to earn income. McArthur J also considered that the fees were comparable to expenditure on “repairs” to the initial shareholder agreements and were not capital expenditure. The above cases confirm that expenditure is not necessarily non-deductible 120. because it relates to a company’s administration or structure. Alteration of shareholders’ rights A company is a separate entity from the shareholders. They do not own the 121. company’s property or its business, other than through the ownership of a share. 24 The shares confer on the shareholders an interest in the company to the extent of the rights and obligations defined in the company’s constitution or in the Companies Act 1993. A company must not take any action that affects the rights attached to shares unless that action has been approved by a special resolution of each interest group. Expenditure incurred to alter shareholders’ rights will most likely be regarded as 122. non-deductible because it fails to have the necessary nexus to the company’s business or it is capital expenditure. This is because such matters will usually be related to either the right to distributions of profit or the right to control the company (affecting voting rights). These matters are related to the business entity, rather than to the carrying on of a business. In St George Bank, Perram J considered that the number of shares on issue and 123. the arrangements about the distribution of profits were not related to the company’s income-earning activities. However, Perram J noted (at \[97\] – \[98\]) that in some circumstances (not present in the case), the position and rights of the shareholders may be enmeshed with the company’s business. That is, expenditure could be deductible in some circumstances even though the expenditure relates to the position and rights of shareholders. In St George Bank it was held that expenditure incurred in obtaining an advantage relating to a company’s business may be deductible although the expenditure also results in the alteration of the rights of shareholders. It is difficult to be definitive about the circumstances in which a company may 124. obtain an advantage of a revenue nature from expenditure incurred in altering shareholders’ rights. One possibility might be where the rights of shareholders are altered in conjunction with an alteration to the company’s constitution to obtain a revenue advantage. Carron is authority that expenditure incurred in altering a constitution to obtain a revenue advantage is deductible. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that generally expenditure incurred in 125. altering the rights of shareholders will not satisfy the general permission. However, in some circumstances, the interests of the shareholders may coincide with the interests of the company. The alteration of the rights of shareholders may be an ancillary or incidental effect of expenditure incurred for the company’s business. In such circumstances, the fact that the expenditure also results in the alteration of the rights of shareholders does not necessarily mean that the expenditure is not deductible. In each case, the true nature of the advantage sought or obtained from the expenditure must be identified. Arrangements with creditors A company that is in financial difficulties may wish to take advantage of provisions 126. in Parts 13, 14 and 15 of the Companies Act 1993 that allow it to implement compromises, arrangements, amalgamations and reconstructions. Andrew Beck in Guidebook to NZ Companies and Securities Law (8th ed, 2010, 127. CCH, Auckland) at \[1134\] states that common outcomes from compromises with creditors are an extended time to repay debts, acceptance of less than the full amount of the debt owing, and priority for some creditors over others. A compromise that is approved by creditors at a creditors’ compromise meeting is binding on the company and on all creditors, or all creditors of the particular class of creditors, to whom notice of the proposal is given. Part of this process may include a shareholders’ meeting to consider directors’ 128. proposals relating to creditors. It is primarily these costs that are being considered here, not the costs in relation to compromise meetings of creditors. 25 FCT v Snowden & Willson Pty Ltd (1958) 99 CLR 431 suggests that expenditure 129. incurred in enforcing debts owed to a taxpayer and in resisting claims by debtors of the taxpayer for a reduction of their liability is deductible. The High Court of Australia held that the expenditure was deductible because the matters at issue could have had an effect on the company’s business. The Commissioner considers that similar considerations would arise for debts 130. owed by a taxpayer to creditors. Dealing with creditors may be regarded as an ordinary incident of a business and expenditure incurred in dealing with creditors will generally have the necessary connection with the carrying on of the business of the company. Therefore, expenditure to consider a directors’ proposal involving dealings with 131. creditors is likely to be deductible, as such an arrangement with creditors is made to get approval from creditors to allow the company to keep on trading. An analogy can be drawn with Carron in that such an arrangement is made to remove impediments to efficient trading. Dealing with creditors is an ordinary incident of a company’s business and is recurrent throughout the life of a company. The Commissioner considers that the indirect meeting costs incurred in these 132. circumstances are not capital expenditure. Expenditure on an arrangement with creditors is unlikely to be made “once and for all” and does not bring into existence an identifiable asset. The source of funds is likely to be circulating capital and on ordinary accounting principles the expenditure will be treated as being on revenue account. Although it could be argued that the expenditure relates to maintaining the business entity or capital structure, the expenditure is more closely related to the operations of the business. Liquidation The shareholders of a company may appoint a liquidator by a special resolution of 133. shareholders. The principal duty of a liquidator is to take possession of, protect, realise, and distribute the company’s assets. If there are surplus assets remaining, the liquidator is required to distribute the assets or the proceeds of realisation in accordance with the company’s constitution or in accordance with the Companies Act 1993. Andrew Beck, in Guidebook to NZ Companies and Securities Law, states at \[1501\] 134. that normally the winding up of a company (which terminates the existence of the company) is preceded by liquidation. In the Commissioner’s view, indirect meeting costs incurred for shareholders to 135. consider the liquidation of a company are not deductible. This is because: • Expenditure incurred in closing down a business is not deductible as it is incurred in disposing of a business and ceasing to derive income, rather than in deriving income. • If the company’s business has already ceased, the costs will not be incurred in the course of deriving income: Amalgamated Zinc (de Bavay’s) Ltd v FCT (1935) 54 CLR 295 (HCA). • Costs of appointing a liquidator are capital expenditure, being expenditure incurred to distribute the company’s assets (that is, to dismantle the business structure). Major transactions under the Companies Act 1993 A major transaction is one that, under s 129 of the Companies Act 1993: 136. 26 • involves the acquisition of assets or disposition of assets of the company where the value of those assets is equal to more than half the value of the company’s assets; or • has the effect of the company either acquiring rights or interests, or incurring obligations or liabilities, the value of which is more than half the value of the company’s assets prior to the transaction. The management of a company is generally reserved to the directors but s 129 137. provides a limitation on the directors, in that a company must not enter into a major transaction unless it is contingent on, or has the approval of, shareholders by way of a special resolution. However, if the approval of the shareholders is not obtained, a major transaction would still be valid unless the other party to the transaction knew or ought to have known that the consent of shareholders had not been obtained: s 18(1)(a) Companies Act 1993. The legislative history of s 129 suggests Parliament’s purpose for the section was 138. to provide a protection for shareholders. The report of the Law Commission, Company Law Reform and Restatement (NZLC R9, June 1989), included the first draft of what became the Companies Act 1993. The report commented on s 99, the "major transaction" provision that was enacted as s 129. The Law Commission stated: 499 The provision is based on the view that some dealings have such far-reaching effects that they should be referred to shareholders. Shareholders should not find that massive transactions have transformed the company they invested in without warning. Clearly, unless the constitution of a company restricts its activities, all shareholders will have to accept a large measure of change. Normally that may be achieved over some time, permitting the shareholder who does not like the direction the company is taking to leave or to exercise his rights to call management to account. What we are concerned about is abrupt and substantial change which transforms the nature of the enterprise. We think that recent experience in New Zealand has demonstrated that such transformation is a problem that should be faced up to and that it has often operated to the detriment of the company and the shareholders. \[Emphasis added\] There is also some support in case law for the view that s 129 protects 139. shareholders. In Xylem Fund I, LP and Xylem Investments GP Inc v Fletcher Challenge Forests Ltd (2002) 9 NZCLC 262,955, the High Court refused an application by minority shareholders for an order restraining the company from allowing another shareholder to vote on a s 129 resolution seeking approval for the company to acquire certain assets (Resolution 1). The minority shareholders sought the order because the other shareholder was to be involved in various transactions that would provide funding for the acquisition. The court refers to s 129 as providing protection for shareholders, at 262,963: The necessity for a special resolution under s 129 is the appropriate protection for shareholders in relation to Resolution 1. Significantly, a shareholder who votes against a successful s 129 resolution has a 140. further protection provided by s 110 of the Companies Act 1993. Section 110 entitles them to require the company to purchase their shares. This suggests the scheme of the Companies Act is primarily for s 129 to provide protection for shareholders, rather than reserving a significant management power to shareholders. In practice, prudent directors would generally only commit to proceed with a 141. major transaction once it was fully investigated and they would only incur the expense of holding a meeting of shareholders when they were fairly confident of gaining shareholder approval. Section 129 provides for a company to enter into a major transaction contingent on shareholder approval. If the transaction proceeds without approval, the Companies Act provides that the transaction could still be valid. Accordingly, shareholder approval under s 129 will often be a contingency 27 to a decision that precedes it, providing shareholders some protection of their int erests in the company. In the Commissioner's Interpretation Statement IS 08/02: “Deductibility of 142. feasibility expenditure”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 8 (July 2008): 12, feasibility expenditure is defined as expenditure incurred to determine the practicability of a new proposal. However, IS 08/02 draws a distinction between expenditure incurred in the course of carrying on a business to enable a taxpayer to make an informed decision on the acquisition of a capital asset (or other enduring advantage) and expenditure incurred once the decision is made to proceed with the acquisition. Expenditure incurred once a decision is made to proceed with the acquisition is more likely to be capital expenditure. In IS 08/02, the Commissioner concludes that commitment to proceed with a 143. capital project can still be made despite recognising that whether the development or acquisition ultimately goes ahead may be contingent on particular factors. For example, the taxpayers in Milburn had committed to developing the quarry sites, but the obtaining of appropriate resource consents was a known contingency. Other contingencies that may be recognised are the need for technical refinement to occur and the obtaining of the final construction cost. Such matters would not necessarily mean a commitment or decision to proceed with the acquisition or development of a capital asset had not been made, if the facts or circumstances otherwise showed that the taxpayer was actively proceeding. Also, IS 08/02 concludes that "commitment does not require a legal or other form of binding decision that is final and irrevocable"(at para 186). In the Commissioner’s view, it is most likely that approval under s 129 occurs 144. after a company commits to a capital transaction and is part of the costs of acquiring or disposing of an asset under the “major transaction”. Whether this is the case will always be a question of fact. Indirect meeting costs to consider major transactions incurred after the company has committed to the transaction are non-deductible because of the capital limitation. Ratifying directors’ actions or breaches of their duty to the company Section 177 of the Companies Act 1993 gives shareholders the power to ratify the 145. purported exercise by the directors of a power vested in the shareholders. The section contemplates a situation where the directors did not have the power to act, so that the action taken by the directors is invalid. If ratified, the purported exercise of that power is deemed to be a valid exercise of the power. In other words, if the purported exercise by the directors of a power vested in the shareholders is ratified, the exercise of the power is treated as the exercise of the power by the shareholders. On that basis, expenditure incurred in considering whether to ratify the exercise by the directors of a power that is vested in the shareholders should have the same treatment as expenditure incurred in exercising the power directly. In addition, s 177(4) of the Companies Act 1993 preserves the existing rules of 146. law relating to the ratification or approval by shareholders of any act or omission of the directors. Under the common law the directors have a fiduciary duty to the company analogous to that of trustees: Re Smith & Fawcett Ltd \[1942\] 1 All ER 542 (CA). The duties of directors under the common law are set out in the Companies Act 1993. These duties are: • to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company when exercising their powers or performing duties; • to exercise a power for a proper purpose; 28 • not to act, or agree to the company acting, in contravention of the Companies Act 1993 or the company’s constitution; • not to agree to the business of the company being carried on in a manner likely to create a serious loss or risk to the company’s creditors; • not to incur an obligation unless the directors believe on reasonable grounds at the time that the company will be able to perform the obligation when required; • to exercise care, diligence and skill that reasonable directors would exercise in the same circumstances taking into account the nature of the company, the nature of the decision and the position of the directors, and the nature of the responsibilities undertaken by them. A transaction that is entered into in breach of a duty of the directors is voidable by 147. the company. Ratification by the shareholders has the effect of affirming the transaction: North-West Transportation Co Ltd v Beatty (1887) 12 App Cas 589 (PC); Bamford v Bamford \[1969\] 1 All ER 969 (CA). Ratification does not release the directors from personal liability and ratification in this context means no more than an election by the company not to exercise its right to rescind a transaction. Where the directors have acted in breach of their duty to the company in 148. exercising their power to manage the company and its business, the company has a choice whether to rescind or ratify the directors’ actions. That decision can only be made by the shareholders. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, expenditure incurred for shareholders meeting to consider the ratification of such a breach of duty by the directors is incurred in exercising a management power in carrying on the company’s business. Such expenditure has a sufficient relationship with the carrying on of the company’s business. Whether the expenditure is deductible does not depend on the action that is ratified (that is, on whether it relates to a transaction of a capital nature). Takeovers (target company) The costs considered are those of a target company in receipt of a takeover offer 149. incurred to allow shareholders to meet to consider the takeover offer. Under the Takeovers Code, the target company is entitled to recover from the offeror any costs incurred on an offer or a takeover notice. However, the target company could be faced with expenditure that it has not been able to recover. The costs incurred by the entity making a takeover bid are not considered here. FCT v The Swan Brewery Co Ltd 91 ATC 4,637 (FCAFC) shows that the existence 150. of a statutory obligation to incur expenditure (such as under the Takeovers Code) does not necessarily mean that expenditure incurred in complying with the obligation is deductible. In Swan Brewery, the company had a statutory obligation to provide an independent report on the takeover offer to shareholders and to provide advice on the takeover offer to shareholders. However, the court held that there was no relationship between the carrying on of the company’s business and expenditure incurred in providing information to shareholders. Swan Brewery also supports the view that the fact that the carrying on of a business results in takeover activity is not sufficient. The court considered that expenditure incurred in providing information regarding a takeover offer to shareholders related to the interests of the shareholders in the company. See also St George Bank, in which Perram J commented that the costs incurred by companies in complying with regulatory obligations may in some cases be capital expenditure. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) considers that costs incurred by the target 151. company of a takeover bid (including legal and accounting fees, stockbrokers’ fees, consultancy fees, printing, advertising and mailing costs and the costs of 29 independent reports) are not incurred in gaining or producing income: Taxation Ruling, IT 2656: “Income tax: Deductibility of takeover defence costs” (October 1991, addendum September 1998). The ATO also considers that takeover defence costs are capital expenditure, being costs incurred to protect or preserve the capital structure or the ownership of the company. However, in Boulangerie (Tax CC), Archambault TCCJ did not accept that the 152. expenditure in question was incurred to preserve the existing shareholders’ positions as owners of the company. The expenditure was considered to be incurred to secure an advantage of a revenue nature for the company. In that case, in making their recommendation to shareholders, the directors considered the effect of one of the proposed takeovers on the company’s relationship with its employees and customers and the continuity of the company’s business. Also, the directors recommended that the shareholders did not accept the highest offer. The offer the board recommended replaced all of the existing shareholders, rather than improving the positions of existing shareholders. However, Archambault TCCJ noted that if the company had wanted to maintain the status quo, the expenditure would have been capital expenditure. In the Commissioner’s view, whether expenditure incurred to allow shareholders 153. to consider a takeover offer is deductible depends on the facts in each case: • Expenditure incurred merely to provide information to shareholders as to the adequacy o f the takeover offer or to preserve the position of existing shareholders is not deductible. There is an insufficient relationship between expenditure incurred for the benefit of shareholders, or to satisfy a duty to shareholders, and the company’s business: Swan Brewery. • Expenditure incurred in providing information to shareholders on a takeover offer to obtain a benefit of a capital nature (such as the prevention of the winding up of the company’s business, new equity funds, the expansion of the company’s business) is capital expenditure: Boulangerie (Tax CC) and (FCA). • Expenditure incurred in providing information to shareholders regarding a takeover offer with a view to preventing a takeover offer that would detrimentally affect the company’s ability to continue its business in the same form is deductible: Boulangerie (Tax CC) and (FCA); Swan Brewery. Statutory return fees A company is required to file certain information with the Companies Office as 154. part of the disclosure requirements in the Companies A ct 1993. This includes: • Notice of change of registered office. • Notice of change of address for service. • Annual return. Service of documents relating to legal proceedings and delivery of other 155. documents to the company is effective if the documents are delivered or posted to the address for service or registered office notified in the Companies Register. Failure to file the annual return or notices of change of the company’s address for service or registered office may result in documents served or delivered at an incorrect address being treated as effective although the company may not have received the documents. A company cannot take steps in response to actions taken against the company, and that may have an impact on the company’s business, unless it receives notice of the proposed action. 30 Complying with these requirements is an administrative matter to ensure that 156. there is accountability for persons carrying on business through a company. Such expenditure is required to be met by all companies, regardless of whether the company is carrying on business. To that extent, it may be argued that such expenses are not dictated by the business ends. However, a primary reason for incurring the expenditure is to ensure that the 157. company remains on the register so that it can continue to operate as a company. A company may agree to meet these obligations in commercial contracts entered into between the company and third parties. While a contract between the company and a third party cannot determine the tax treatment of expenditure incurred pursuant to the agreement, it indicates how the business community views such obligations. As mentioned, Distillers concerned apportioning various items of expenditure 158. incurred by a holding company because the company’s income included exempt income. The company had incurred general expenses, including “minor filing fees”. The court considered some of the expenses were deductible in full and that apportionment was required for others, including the filing expenses because they could not be traced exclusively to any particular type of income. The case supports the view that statutory filing fees would generally be deductible. The court did not explain the basis for the conclusion but stated (at 1,172) in relation to all the expenses (including the filing fees) that: All of such expenses may very well have been incurred for the purpose of gaining or producing income from the appellant's business, and the evidence, so far as it goes, tends to support the fact so assumed. In the Distillers litigation, t he Tax Appeal Board (No. 226 v MNR 55 DTC 18) had 159. considered that the expenditure considered in the case was in the nature of maintenance expenditure, being expenditure that is required to satisfy obligations that a company has under the Canadian equivalent to the New Zealand Companies Act 1993 “to do certain things each year in order to remain a subsisting corporation” (at 19). The reality is that a company cannot continue its business if it fails to meet its 160. filing obligations as it could be struck off the register for non-compliance. Similarly, if it fails to comply with obligations imposed by a third-party lender, it could be in default of its obligations under its financing agreements. Clearly, where a company is not carrying on a business, it would not be possible to establish a relationship between the statutory filing fees and any business. In the Commissioner’s view, where a company is carrying on a business, it is likely that a court would hold that expenditure incurred by a company in complying with statutory obligations relating to the administration of the company is deductible, being expenditure that is analogous to maintenance expenditure. Accordingly, in the Commissioner’s view, the commercial necessity for the 161. expenditure provides strong grounds for finding that expenditure on such filing fees should be regarded as having the required relationship to the business operations of a company. However, the expenditure must still be tested against the capital limitation. The 162. Commissioner considers s tatutory filing expenses are not capital expenditure as: • The filing fees are by their nature recurrent, create no asset and have no benefit that endures in the way that fixed capital endures. • Such expenses are likely to be met out of the circulating capital of the company as such expenses are part of the recurrent business cycle of a company. 31 • Although statutory filing expenses are related to the corporate structure, they are expenses relating to maintaining the company as a statutorily compliant company rather than enlarging or altering the business structure. 32 REFERENCES Related rulings/statements Interpretation Statement IS 08/02: “Deductibility of feasibility expenditure”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 8 (July 2008): 12 Interpretation Statement IS 10/06: “Deductibility of business relocation costs”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 8 (September 2010): 20 Interpretation Statement IS 13/03: “Income Tax – deductibility of expenditure incurred in borrowing money – Section DB 5”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 1 (February 2014): 3 Subject references General permission, capital limitation, private limitation Company administration costs – annual and special meeting costs;

Certain scholarships and bursaries are exempt income under s CW 36. This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s view of how s CW 36 should be interpreted and applied. 2. A scholarship is a sum of money, or its equivalent, granted to a person for the primary purpose of assisting them with their education where the recipient is selected on merit or some other criteria. 3. A bursary is a sum of money, or its equivalent, granted to a person meeting certain criteria (often needs-based) for the primary purpose of assisting the recipient with funding their education. 4. If a scholarship or bursary is an amount of income under a provision of Part C or under ordinary principles, then s CW 36 may exempt that scholarship or bursary from income tax. Not all scholarships or bursaries received by a person will be amounts of income. 5. If a student receives a basic grant or independent circumstances grant from StudyLink (Ministry of Social Development), then the exemption in s CW 36 does not apply to that grant, and the grant will be taxable under s CF 1. 6. When applying the exemption in s CW 36, the New Zealand courts’ approach is to determine the true character of the scholarship or bursary by considering the agreement that gives rise to the payment and the surrounding circumstances. There is no single rigid test. In particular, the courts consider:  the relationship between the payer and the payee;  the contractual basis for the payment;  the conditions of the agreement; and  anything the payee is required to provide in return for the payment. 7. For the exemption to apply, the scholarship or bursary must be made for the dominant purpose of assisting with the recipient’s education. 8. A bursary or scholarship is usually granted by a public body or an independent private body to enable the recipient to pursue their education. However, sometimes there may be a special relationship between the payer and the recipient. A special relationship may be where the parties are not independent of each other, so that the payer may have competing reasons for the payment being made (eg, an employment relationship). 9. A special relationship between the payer and the recipient may make it harder to demonstrate that the primary purpose of a payment is to assist with the recipient’s education because there can be competing reasons for making the payment. Where no special relationship exists between the payer and the recipient, education assistance is more likely to be regarded as the primary purpose of the payment. This may be the case even where the recipient subsequently takes up employment with the payer. 10. Sometimes a scholarship or bursary may be granted on the condition the recipient provides services for, or on behalf of, the payer. This may not prevent a payment from being a scholarship or bursary so long as the true character of the payment is to assist the recipient’s education and the payment is not made primarily for the payer’s benefit. 3 11. If a payment is equivalent to an amount previously paid as salary or wages, this suggests the payment is simply a re-characterisation of salary or wages and not a scholarship or bursary. 12. The existence of a bonding arrangement between the payer and the recipient may not prevent the payment being a scholarship or bursary. The amount to be repaid as a bond compared with the amount paid to the recipient can be a relevant factor. If all of the payment is to be repaid if the contract is cancelled, this may indicate it is not a scholarship or bursary. 13. For the purposes of s CW 36, an “educational institution” is a society or organisation founded for the sole or main purpose of promoting education and that actively provides that education. Education involves the imparting of knowledge through a systematic formal course of learning. The institution may be located in New Zealand or overseas. In New Zealand, educational institutions include, but are not limited to, schools, universities, wānanga, polytechnics and industry training organisations. 14. “Attendance at”, in the context of an educational institution, can be:  the student’s physical presence at the location where the course is being held;  the student being enrolled and pursuing an educational course offered by the educational institution if it involves requirements other than physical presence; or  a combination of both the above. 15. A scholarship or bursary is derived by the student (ie, the person who is attending at the educational institution). Where the student is a school child the scholarship or bursary is not derived by the child’s parents, even though the payment may be used by the parents to meet their child’s education costs. This is because it is the student who has qualified for and been granted the scholarship or bursary, and the amount is paid to assist that student with their attendance at an educational institution. 16. This Interpretation Statement updates and replaces “Exempting a scholarship from income tax”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 6 (November 1993): 7. That item explains what criteria have to be met before a scholarship by an organisation to sponsor a student would be considered exempt from income tax under s 61(37) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the predecessor to s CW 36). 17. The Interpretation Statement also refers to “Retraining payments made on employment termination – assessability”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995): 6. That item deals with the income tax treatment of retraining payments made by an employer to an employee on the termination of employment. Generally, a retraining payment paid to a former employee will be salary and wages and not a scholarship or bursary that meets the requirements of s CW 36. Introduction 18. If a person receives a scholarship or bursary that is an amount of income, the amount received may be exempt income under s CW 36. 19. The approach taken in this Interpretation Statement to understanding when a scholarship or bursary is exempt income under s CW 36 is to:  consider briefly the relevant legislation; 4  discuss the approach New Zealand courts have taken to determining whether payments are scholarships or bursaries and, therefore, exempt income under s CW 36; and  consider the individual requirements for a scholarship or bursary to be exempt income under s CW 36, in particular: - when a payment is income; - whether a payment is a student allowance; - what is a “scholarship or bursary”; - what is an “educational institution”; and - what is “attendance at” an educational institution. Background 20. The Commissioner has previously been asked whether particular scholarships or bursaries are exempt income under s CW 36. The Commissioner has issued several product rulings confirming that s CW 36 applies to particular scholarships and bursaries (see the Inland Revenue website, www.ird.govt.nz/technical- tax/product-rulings). This Interpretation Statement outlines how s CW 36 applies in a general context. Analysis Relevant legislation 21. Part C sets out what is income and subpart CW sets out what is exempt income. For an amount to be exempt income, there first needs to be an amount of income. Section BD 1(2) provides that: An amount of income of a person is exempt income if it is their exempt income under a provision in subpart CW (Exempt income) or CZ (Terminating provisions) 22. Not all scholarships or bursaries received by a person will be an amount of income (and not taxable on that basis). However, if a scholarship or bursary is an amount of income under a provision of Part C or under ordinary principles, then s CW 36 may exempt that scholarship or bursary from income tax. 23. If s CW 36 applies to a scholarship or bursary, then, from a practical point of view, whether that scholarship or bursary is income does not need to be decided. For this reason, this Interpretation Statement only briefly outlines the general principles the courts have developed to determine whether a scholarship or bursary is an income receipt. Instead, the focus of this Interpretation Statement is on determining when a scholarship or bursary will meet the requirements s CW 36 and be exempt income. 24. Section CW 36 provides: CW 36 Scholarships and bursaries A basic grant or an independent circumstances grant under regulations made under section 303 of the Education Act 1989 is not exempt income, but any other scholarship or bursary for attendance at an educational institution is exempt income. 25. Section CW 36 is a long-standing provision originally enacted in 1940 as part of a set of exemptions introduced to ensure symmetry of treatment between the tax legislation and the social security legislation that existed at the time. Scholarship and bursary payments were exempted from social security contribution requirements, so it was considered appropriate to also exempt these payments from income tax. 26. One minor change was made to the provision in 1988 when basic grants and independent circumstances grants (commonly referred to as “student 5 allowances”) were introduced as part of the government's Youth Support package. At that time, the predecessor to s CW 36 (s 61(37) of the Income Tax Act 1976) was amended to clarify that these grants were not included in the exemption. 27. The provision was reworded as part of the Income Tax Act rewrite process, becoming s CW 29 of the Income Tax Act 2004, then re-enacted as s CW 36 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Originally, when the provision was introduced it required the amount to be derived “from any maintenance or allowance provided for or paid to that person in respect of his or her attendance at an educational institution in terms of a scholarship or bursary”. Some of these words were removed by the rewrite and the exemption was restructured. However, the rewrite changes were not listed as an intended policy change in schedule 22A of the Income Tax Act 2004. 28. The Commissioner considers the rewrite process has not changed the meaning of what is now s CW 36. The provision still aims to exempt from tax a scholarship or bursary received by the recipient for their attendance at an educational institution. New Zealand cases considering s CW 36 29. Before considering the individual requirements of s CW 36, this Interpretation Statement outlines how the New Zealand courts have approached the question of whether payments are scholarships or bursaries and, therefore, exempt income under s CW 36. 30. Several cases have considered s CW 36 and its predecessors. Two main principles can be drawn from these cases. Firstly, to determine whether there is a bursary or scholarship within s CW 36, the true character of the payment must be determined. This requires looking at the characteristics of the payment and its primary purpose. 31. Secondly, the courts have drawn a distinction between scholarships and bursaries that are exempt income under s CW 36 and payments made for other purposes, such as services provided by an employee. Many of the cases considering s CW 36 involve payments made by current or prospective employers to employees while the employees are studying. In this context, where an employment relationship exists between the payer and the recipient, the courts have highlighted that, if the true character of the payment is not for the purpose of education but is a payment of salary and wages, then the payment is not a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36. 32. The leading New Zealand case on the exemption from tax for scholarships and bursaries is the Court of Appeal decision in Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176. The case did not concern an employee situation, but rather a trainee teacher enrolled at a teachers’ training college. While studying at the college, the trainee teacher received a student teacher allowance paid fortnightly by the Wellington Education Board. As a condition of receiving the student teacher allowance, the taxpayer was required to enter into a bond agreement undertaking to repay all or part of the bond if he failed to complete the prescribed course and three years’ service as a teacher following graduation. 33. The Court of Appeal held the student teacher allowance was income according to ordinary concepts but the exemption for scholarships and bursaries applied to exempt the payments from tax. 34. On the question of whether the student teacher allowance payments were income, Richardson J confirmed the view of Quilliam J in the High Court (Reid v 6 CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624) that the payments were income according to ordinary concepts, stating, at 5,183: The sums in question were regular periodical payments made to the appellant to defray his expenses while attending teachers’ college full-time as a teacher trainee. They were paid to him for that purpose and were the whole or part of the receipts upon which he depended for that purpose. They were not gifts. They were contractual payments to which the appellant was entitled so long as he performed his part of the bargain. They were emoluments received in respect of and in return for his performance of the obligations of the studentship he had undertaken. It is implicit in sec 61(37) that at least some scholarship and bursary payments constitute income according to ordinary concepts, otherwise it would be unnecessary to exempt such income. \[Emphasis added\] 35. On the question of whether the payments were exempt income, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision and found that the student teacher allowance was exempt from tax. Richardson J found the student teacher allowance was a bursary. He reached this conclusion by determining the true character of the payment received, stating, at 5,184: The essential question is as to the true character of the sums received by the appellant. The answer is not to be found through the application of any single rigid test. It must be derived from a consideration of all the circumstances, some of which may point in one direction, some in another. \[Emphasis added\] 36. Richardson J considered the student teacher allowance was an exempt bursary despite being a contractual payment requiring the student to fulfil his course requirements and be available to serve as a teacher for three years after graduation. He went on to note that these types of conditions were not unusual for scholarships and bursaries, whether expressed in terms of expectation or binding obligation. 37. Somers J took much the same view as Richardson J and considered the payments were a bursary because they were paid to, and received by, a student to assist in their education and for the purpose of sustaining the student while furthering their education. The fact conditions as to service for a period after graduation were attached to the arrangement did not make the payments any less a scholarship. 38. Thorp J thought the student teacher allowance was a bursary based on an objective assessment of the true character of the payment received by the student, taking into account all circumstances relevant to determining the true character. He stated, at 5,191: To my mind, subsec (37) \[s 61(37) of the Income Tax Act 1976, the predecessor to s CW 36\], which provides the exemption with which we are now concerned, the exemption of income “derived by any person ... in terms of a scholarship or bursary”, is of the second type, and the question whether particular payments or income are of that nature should be determined in an objective fashion, taking into account all circumstances relevant to determining their true character. ... Within the Commonwealth, the only decision located on the existence of exemption provisions is that in FC of T v Hall. There the test finally selected by Rath J to determine the classification of the payments to the physician was whether they had as their real character payment for education as distinct from payment for specific work. It is my view that a similar pragmatic balancing operation is the proper approach in determining the character and purpose of the payments to the appellant. There is no gainsaying that in some respects they had the character of payments by way of retainer, payments to secure rights for the payer rather than benefits for the payee. However, in determining which purpose was dominant, the matter which seems to me greatly in favour of the appellant is the minimal sum required to be repaid if the appellant failed to make himself available to the department after his graduation. His maximum obligation in that event was $600. By contrast, failure by him to complete the course could, in terms of reg 39(3) of the 1959 Regulations, render him liable to refund of all sums paid to him by way of allowances to the date of termination of his studies. Had the department’s principal purpose been to secure the appellant’s future services rather than finance 7 his education the penalty provided for breach of the covenant to accept employment after graduation would surely not have been less than that resulting from failure to complete the course. \[Emphasis added\] 39. Thorp J considered that the principal purpose of the payment was to assist the recipient with obtaining educational qualifications. This was despite the conditions restricting the subsequent employment and activities of the recipient. 40. Several other decisions followed Reid (CA). The High Court considered the exemption did not apply in CIR v Drew (1988) 10 NZTC 5,060. The taxpayer, a recent school leaver, applied for a bursar position with the Post Office. He was awarded the bursary and entered into an agreement with the Post Office. The agreement provided he was to be employed as an accounting bursar and the Post Office would grant him assistance to undertake a course of study. The assistance involved a leave of absence from his bursar position to enable him to study for an accountancy degree. During this time he would receive financial assistance determined by the Postmaster-General. The taxpayer was also bonded to work at the Post Office for five years after completing his degree or otherwise repay the sums paid to him reduced by the value of the actual services rendered by him. 41. During the early years of the agreement, the taxpayer was paid his ordinary salary when he worked and an annual bursary of $700 during each academic year. In 1982 the arrangement changed and the taxpayer was paid his full salary while he was studying and no bursary was paid. Despite this change in arrangement, the Taxation Review Authority, in Case G56 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,247, found that the payments from 1982 were an exempt “bursary or scholarship”. This was on the basis the taxpayer had been awarded the bursary for his university studies based on merit. The taxpayer had submitted his secondary school academic record when he applied for the position and was awarded the bursary after a successful interview process. The Commissioner appealed this decision. 42. Ellis J, on appeal in the High Court, followed the approach in Reid (CA) and concluded the principal purpose of the payments was to secure the services of the taxpayer and therefore the payments were not exempt, stating at 5,062: In my view the principal purpose of the payments was to secure for the Postmaster- General the services of Mr Drew and in particular, his services when he had qualified. The secondary purpose of the payment was to assist Mr Drew in his education and accordingly I am of the view that the receipt by him of $9,721.00 was taxable in his hands ... ... In my view the Court has to consider the character of the payments against the total background of the situation. \[Emphasis added\] 43. Ellis J considered it relevant that the agreement described the taxpayer as an “employee” and that the taxpayer was working for the Post Office during the whole period of the contract and was paid his normal salary during this time. Ellis J found it difficult to accept the taxpayer would receive more while he was studying by virtue of receiving his salary tax-free. He also considered it relevant that the operation of the bond required the taxpayer to repay all of the money advanced, subject to a reduction for time actually served. These factors distinguished Drew from Reid (CA), where it was less evident that an employee- employer relationship existed. 44. Case L30 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,181 had similar facts to Drew. The taxpayer was an employee of the Post Office when he was granted a scholarship. This scholarship entitled him to complete a university degree for two years on full pay on the same bonding terms as in Drew. The taxpayer tried to distinguish his situation from the facts in Drew on the basis that he was an existing employee (unlike the 8 taxpayer in Drew who was recruited from secondary school) who was given an educational opportunity more as a reward for effort than was the case in Drew. This opportunity came at a greater financial cost to his employer. Keane DJ was not persuaded by these arguments. 45. Keane DJ considered the payments were income according to ordinary principles. He then went on to acknowledge that the assistance provided could aptly be called a scholarship because it was an award for effort and merit. However, he concluded that the payments needed to be for the purpose of education to be exempt, although he acknowledged this purpose may not be the exclusive purpose of the payment. On this basis, Keane DJ concluded that the employer’s primary purpose was to assist the taxpayer to become a better equipped employee, where both the employee and employer reaped the benefits from the arrangement. Keane DJ considered the arrangement to be more like an employer’s incentive scheme, rather than a scholarship or bursary paid for attendance at an education institution. For these reasons, Keane DJ did not consider the exemption in what is now s CW 36 applied. 46. Other cases that are similar to the facts of Case L30 and where the courts have also considered the true nature of the payments were salary payments rather than a scholarship or bursary payment are Case L35 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,218 and Case M24 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,146. 47. Case M66 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,371 concerned an engineering cadet who was employed by a construction company. While employed, he attended a technical institute full time for a period of 19 weeks as part of gaining his trade certificate in engineering. During this time he received his salary. These payments were considered to be salary paid under a contract of employment that included a requirement to complete the study and not a scholarship or bursary for attendance at an educational institution. Bathgate DJ again saw the conditions set out in the contract of employment as very important in determining the character of the payments received by the taxpayer and the character of the payments made by the employer. The same decision was reached in Case P2 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,010 based on similar facts. 48. In Case P17 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,115 the terms of the agreement were similar to those in Case L30 except that the taxpayer completed his study overseas. This did not alter the Authority’s finding that the nature of the payments was contractual payments. 49. Case P23 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,166 involved the situation of a prospective employee receiving financial assistance while studying. A grant was made to the taxpayer while he was studying. One of the terms of the grant was that the taxpayer work for the organisation that made the grant for nine months and one week on completion of the taxpayer’s studies. During the study period, the taxpayer was offered and took up employment with the organisation that made the grant under a separate agreement. The Taxation Review Authority found that the financial assistance payments were not made for the purpose of securing the future services of the taxpayer because the subsequent offer of employment was in an area unrelated to the taxpayer’s study. The true flavour of the agreement was the provision of financial assistance to enable the taxpayer to complete his studies. At the time the agreement was entered into the taxpayer did not have an employment relationship with the provider of the assistance. For these reasons, Willy DJ found on the facts that the payments of financial assistance received by the taxpayer while studying were exempt. 50. In Case T46 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,311 the taxpayer was granted special leave on full pay by his employer to study at an American university for three years. The taxpayer had to sign a bond guaranteeing that he would return to New Zealand 9 after completion of his study and work for the employer for 3.4 years or repay the amount (which could be reduced in proportion to service rendered). Barber DJ accepted that the principal purpose of the overseas study arrangement was education-related. However, he did not think this overcame the fact the arrangement was an extension of the taxpayer’s employment. The employment relationship did not significantly change during the special leave period, even though the taxpayer did not receive some entitlements during that period. The purpose of the arrangement was primarily to retain a highly qualified staff member. 51. These cases show that New Zealand courts have consistently looked to assess the true character of these types of payments by looking at the agreement that gives rise to the payment and the surrounding circumstances. The courts have considered, in particular, the relationship between the payer and the payee, the contractual basis for the payments, the conditions of the agreement(s) and anything the payee is required to provide in return for the payments. The cases show that where an employer pays for an employee to undertake study while employed and the employee receives study assistance equivalent to the employee’s salary, then it is unlikely the payment will be exempt under s CW 36. This is because payments that have the character of salary or wages are not a bursary or scholarship to attend an educational institution. For a payment to be a scholarship or bursary it must be made for the dominant purpose of assisting with the recipient’s education. 52. The Commissioner notes the above cases considered the exemption provision at a time when it still referred to “any maintenance or allowance ... in terms of a scholarship or bursary”. While s CW 36 no longer contains this reference, the Commissioner considers the above cases to be useful guidance on how s CW 36 is applied. Principles drawn from the New Zealand cases 53. The courts have established that to determine whether a payment is a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36, the true character of the payment must be determined. In particular, for a payment to fall under s CW 36, the primary purpose of the payment must be to assist the recipient’s education. This is determined by considering all the circumstances of the particular case. Usually no one single factor is dominant or conclusive. In reaching their decision, the courts consider such factors as any special relationship between the payer and the payee, the contractual basis for the payment, the conditions of the agreement(s) and anything the payee is required to provide in return for the payment. A special relationship may be where the parties are not independent of each other, so that the payer may have competing reasons for the payment being made (eg, an employment relationship). Further, the fact a payment is called a scholarship or bursary is not determinative of its nature. Similarly a payment referred to as an award or fellowship, may in fact be a scholarship or bursary. 54. The courts have most frequently considered the true character of scholarship or bursary-type payments where employment has been the special relationship between the payer and the recipient. In the employment context, the question is whether the true character of the payments is that of a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36 or whether they are salary and wages in the context of an employment relationship. In the Commissioner’s view, the courts would take the same balanced approach to considering the true character of scholarship or bursary-type payments if there were a different type of special relationship between the parties. The primary purpose of the payment must always be to assist the recipient’s education. 10 55. The following factors have been extracted from the cases as being relevant when determining whether the true character of a payment is a scholarship or bursary for the purposes of s CW 36:  There is no single rigid test. All circumstances relevant to determining the true character of the payment are to be taken into account. This may include considering any special relationship between the payer and the recipient, the contractual basis for the payment, the conditions of the agreement(s) and anything the payee is required to provide in return for the payment.  The fact of an existing or a continuing employment contract between the payer and the recipient is a significant and important factor in determining the character of the payment received.  Determining whether the primary purpose of the payment is to secure rights for the payer (eg, future services of the payee) rather than benefits for the payee is a relevant factor.  If the amount paid for the study period equals the amount that was previously paid as salary, this suggests the salary and wages have simply been re-characterised as a scholarship or bursary, so will not be exempt income.  The existence of a bonding arrangement in itself does not mean the payment is not a scholarship or bursary.  The amount to be repaid as a bond compared with the amount paid to the recipient can be a relevant factor. If all of the money advanced is to be repaid if the employee cancels the contract, this may indicate payment for employment.  Where no special relationship exists between the payer and the recipient at the time the agreement to provide financial assistance is entered into, the education of the recipient is more likely to be regarded as the primary purpose of the payment. This may be the case even where the recipient subsequently takes up employment with the payer. Requirements of s CW 36 56. Having considered the courts’ approach to deciding whether a payment is a scholarship or bursary for the purposes of s CW 36 and the words of the provision, the following questions establish whether a payment meets the particular requirements of s CW 36:  Is the payment income?  Is the payment a student allowance?  Is the payment a “scholarship or bursary”?  Is the recipient attending an “educational institution”?  Is the payment for the recipient’s “attendance at” an educational institution? Is the payment income? 57. As mentioned, this Interpretation Statement only briefly outlines the general principles the courts have developed for determining whether a scholarship or 11 bursary is an amount of income. This is because, from a practical perspective, whether the scholarship or bursary is income does not need to be considered in detail if the other requirements of s CW 36 are met. The main focus of this Interpretation Statement is on whether the payment is a bursary or scholarship that is exempt income under s CW 36 and not whether the payment is income in the first instance. 58. However, for the sake of completeness it is noted that not all scholarships and bursaries will be income in the hands of the recipient. For example, a scholarship awarded to a school child to attend a particular school might be a capital receipt (and not income under ordinary concepts) to the child and therefore not taxable income on that basis. 59. Part C sets out what amounts will be amounts of income. Section CA 1 provides the following general rule for establishing whether an amount is income: CA 1 Amounts that are income Amounts specifically identified (1) An amount is income of a person if it is their income under a provision in this Part. Ordinary meaning (2) An amount is also income of a person if it is their income under ordinary concepts. \[Emphasis added\] 60. Therefore, an amount will be income if it is income under one of the provisions of Part C. Part C is effectively a list of amounts that are treated as being amounts of income. Alternatively, an amount will be income if it is “income under ordinary concepts”. 61. The phrase “under ordinary concepts” is not defined in the Act. However, the courts have considered the meaning of what is income “under ordinary concepts” in several cases. 62. It is generally accepted that income is something that “comes in” (ie, it is income in the hands of the taxpayer). In Tennant v Smith \[1892\] AC 150, the taxpayer's accommodation in his employer’s premises where he was required to live was held to not be income, as the taxpayer received no amount. This was because the benefit could not be converted to cash; it merely saved the taxpayer from having to pay for accommodation. This decision was cited with approval in the High Court judgment in Reid. 63. In Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 215 (NSWSC), at 219 Jordan CJ observed, at 219 that: \[T\]he word “income” is not a term of art, and what forms of receipts are comprehended within it, and what principles are to be applied to ascertain how much of those receipts ought to be treated as income, must be determined in accordance with the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind except insofar as the statute states or indicates an intention that receipts which are not income in ordinary parlance are to be treated as income, or that special rules are to be applied for arriving at the taxable amount of such receipts. 64. Justice Richardson cited this excerpt with approval in the Court of Appeal in Reid. After citing Jordan CJ, Richardson J said, at 5,183: There may be difficulty in marginal cases in determining what are the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind in this regard and to assist in that determination there has been much discussion in the cases of criteria which bear on the characterisation of receipts as income in particular classes of case. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of a payment (FC of T v Dixon (1952) 86 CLR 540; and Asher v London Film Productions \[1944\] 1 All ER 77). If it has that quality of regularity or recurrence then the payments become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for his living expenses, just as in the case of a salary or wage earner, annuitant or welfare 12 beneficiary. But that in itself is not enough and consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee and to the purpose of the payment, in order to determine the quality of the payment in the hands of the payee. \[Emphasis added\] 65. According to Richardson J, the major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of a payment. If payments have that quality of regularity or recurrence then they become part of the receipts on which the recipient may depend for their living expenses. However, that factor would not be enough on its own. Consideration must also be given to the relationship between the payer and the payee, and to the purpose of the payment. It is the quality of the payment in the hands of the recipient that is important. 66. The importance of considering the quality of the payment in the hands of the recipient was also emphasised in FCT v Harris 80 ATC 4238 (FCA), where the Australian Federal Court said at 4,240 to 4,241: Whether or not a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient (Scott v. F.C. of T. (1966) 117 C.L.R. 514 at p. 526). The motives of the donor may be relevant but are seldom, if ever, decisive (Scott v. F.C. of T., supra, at p. 526; Hayes v. F.C. of T. (1956) 96 C.L.R. 47 at p. 55). The regularity and periodicity of the payment will be a relevant though generally not decisive consideration (F.C. of T. v. Dixon (1952) 86 C.L.R. 540 at p. 568). A generally decisive consideration is whether the receipt is the product in a real sense of any employment of, or services rendered by the recipient, or of any business, or, indeed, any revenue producing activity carried on by him (Squatting Investment Company Ltd. v. F.C. of T., supra, at p. 633; Hayes v. F.C. of T., supra, at pp. 56-57; Scott v. F.C. of T., supra, at pp. 527-528; cf. C. of T. (Vic.) v. Phillips (1936) 55 C.L.R. 144; A.L. Hamblin Equipment Pty. Limited v. F.C. of T. 74 ATC 4001 at p. 4010). \[Emphasis added\] 67. Hill J in FCT v Hyteco Hiring Pty Limited 92 ATC 4,694 (FFCA), at 4,700, also considered that while regularity of receipt may often indicate that particular amounts are income, regularity alone will seldom be determinative. He considered that something more is required, “such as that the receipts be intended by the payer to be used by the recipient for regular expenditure and be relied upon by the recipient”. He also noted that a single payment may also be income, despite it not being repeated. 68. In addition, a payment that is a gift in the ordinary sense will be income if it is so related to an income-earning activity as to be a product of the income-earning activity. In Hayes v FCT (1956) 11 ATD 68 (HCA), Fullager J, at 72: A voluntary payment of money or transfer of property by A to B is prima facie not income in B's hands. If nothing more appears than that A gave to B some money or a motor car or some shares, what B receives is capital and not income. But further facts may appear which show that, although the payment or transfer was a “gift” in the sense that it was made without legal obligation, it was nevertheless so related to an employment of B by A, or to services rendered by B to A, or to a business carried on by B, that it is, in substance and in reality, not a mere gift but the product of an income-earning activity on the part of B, and therefore to be regarded as income from B's personal exertion. \[Emphasis added\] Summary of income concepts 69. Some key principles from the above cases concerning income under ordinary concepts are:  Income is something that “comes in” (Tennant v Smith, Reid (HC)).  Whether or not a particular receipt is income depends on its quality in the hands of the recipient (Reid (CA)).  The periodic nature of payments made is the major determinant in many cases. Regularity or recurrence indicates that payments may become part 13 of the receipts the recipient depends on for living expenses (Reid (CA), Hyteco).  Consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee (Reid (CA)).  A receipt that is the product in a real sense of any employment of or services rendered by the recipient or of any business or, indeed, any revenue-producing activity carried on by the recipient will be income (Harris).  An amount that would ordinarily be considered a gift may be income if it is so related to an income-earning activity as to be a product of the income earning activity (Hayes). 70. It therefore follows that an amount of a scholarship or bursary paid to a person will be an amount of income under ordinary concepts if it has these types of qualities in the hands of the recipient. Payments without the requisite qualities and that are not income under a provision of Part C will not be taxable to the recipient. If a payment is an amount of income, then it falls to be decided whether it is exempt income under s CW 36. Is the payment a student allowance? 71. To determine whether a payment is exempt from income under s CW 36, the payment must not be a “basic grant” or an “independent circumstances grant”. This is because these payments have been expressly excluded from s CW 36 since 1988 when this exclusion was introduced. Under s CF 1(1), an education grant is income. An “education grant” is defined in s CF 1(2) in the same manner as the grants excluded under s CW 36. Consequently, s CF 1 treats these grants as taxable and s CW 36 confirms this treatment by specifically excluding these grants from the exemption provision. 72. The terms “basic grant” and “independent circumstances grant” are not defined but collectively they are a category of grants paid under the Student Allowances Regulations 1998. These regulations are made under s 303 of the Education Act 1989. These grants are commonly referred to as “student allowances”. They are paid weekly by StudyLink to help with a student’s living costs while the student studies full time at a secondary school or on a tertiary course approved by the Tertiary Education Commission. These tertiary courses include bachelor’s degrees with honours, but exclude all New Zealand Qualifications Framework level 8 and above, postgraduate certificates, diplomas, master's degrees and doctorates. 73. In general, the eligibility criteria for receiving a basic grant are that the person is:  aged at least 18 years old (in certain circumstances 16-17-year-olds are also eligible);  aged under 65 on the start date of the course;  studying full time (or limited full time with approval) in an approved course; and  a New Zealand citizen or meets New Zealand immigration residency requirements. 74. To receive an independent circumstances grant, in addition to meeting the above criteria for a basic grant, the person must satisfy the following:  the student is a single student without a supported child or children; 14  the student is aged under 24;  the student is not living in a parental home or receiving financial assistance from a parent;  it would be unreasonable for the student to live with a parent and expect financial support from their parents (ie the student can demonstrate their circumstances show they are living independently); and  the student does not receive a basic grant. 75. If a student receives a basic grant or independent circumstances grant from StudyLink, StudyLink will deduct PAYE from the payment. StudyLink is required to deduct PAYE as these grants are treated as a “PAYE income payment” under subpart RD (see ss RD 3(1)(a) and RD 5(1)(b)(ii) and (6)(c)). 76. If a student is receiving one of these grants, then the exemption in s CW 36 does not apply to that grant, and the grant will be taxable under s CF 1 . Generally, it will be clear from the circumstances of the payment whether it is one of these grants. Is the payment a “scholarship or bursary”? 77. Having established that the payment is not a “basic grant” or an “independent circumstances grant”, s CW 36 then requires the payment to be a scholarship or bursary. Neither term is defined in the Act. As discussed above, the courts have established that to determine whether there is a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36, the true character of the payment must be determined (Reid (CA), Drew). This requires looking at the characteristics of the payment and the primary purpose of the payment. (This is a different inquiry to determining whether the payment is an amount of income, and for that reason is not restricted to considering the quality of the payment in the hands of the recipient.) 78. In summary, a scholarship or bursary is a sum of money granted to a person to assist the person with their education. In the case of a scholarship, the grant of money has an additional merit or some other rational criterion component (eg, academic performance criteria and applicants must be from a particular ethnic group). 79. To understand the meaning of the phrase “scholarship or bursary” as it is used in s CW 36, it is easier to consider the term “bursary” before the term “scholarship”. This is because, while both terms have distinct meanings, the courts usually give “bursary” a wider definition than they do “scholarship”. Ordinary meaning of bursary 80. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) relevantly defines “bursary” as “a grant, especially one awarded to a student”. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines a “grant” as follows: 1 a sum of money given by a government or public body for a particular purpose. 2 the action of granting something. 3 a legal conveyance or formal conferment. 81. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines the verb to “grant” as: agree to give or allow (something requested); give (a right, property, etc.) formally or legally to. 15 82. The Oxford English Dictionary (online, 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2013, accessed 4 September 2014) defines “bursary” as: an endowment given to a student in a university or school, an exhibition. Also in extended use, an endowment to a person other than a student. 83. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines “endowment” as “the action of endowing” and “endow” as “to give or bequeath an income or property”. The relevant definition in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary for “exhibition” in this context is “a scholarship awarded to a student at a school or university”. 84. Based on the above, the ordinary meaning of “bursary” suggests that a bursary is a sum of money granted by a government or public body to someone. The recipient would commonly be a student, but in an extended meaning can be a person other than a student. The fact a bursary is granted suggests the recipient does not automatically receive the bursary but has to request or apply for it. A scholarship can also be a type of bursary. Case law on the meaning of “bursary” 85. The leading case on the meaning of “bursary” is Reid. The Court of Appeal considered the meaning of “bursary” in the predecessor to s CW 36. All three judgments gave “bursary” a wider meaning than “scholarship”. Richardson J stated, at 5,184: “Bursary” is defined in the same dictionary \[the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\] as “an exhibition at a school or university” (Scotland); and “a scholarship enabling a pupil at an elementary school to proceed to a secondary school” (England). ... Of more significance in this case, “bursary” is a widely used term referring to the grant of financial assistance for educational purposes where the students concerned, and there may be many thousands of them, meet the criteria laid down. Grants of financial assistance for certain classes of students undertaking education in institutions and designated as “bursaries” have been regularly provided from public funds under statutory authority. \[Emphasis added\] 86. Somers J was of the opinion that the term “bursary” has a wide scope. He said, at 5,186: The word "bursary" has reference to moneys paid to and received by a scholar to assist in his education. It has become extended by usage to embrace payments which sustain the recipient while furthering his education such as for food, board, and lodging. \[Emphasis added\] 87. Thorp J discussed the difference between a “scholarship” and a “bursary”. He suggested that, compared with a “scholarship”, a “bursary” did not require a special merit criterion. He commented on the meaning of bursary as outlined in the High Court by Quilliam J, who suggested a bursary as well as a scholarship was an “emolument expressly payable by reason of the winning of an award based on merit”. However, Thorp J suggested, at 5,190, that a bursary did not require a merit criterion other than meeting certain “qualifying standards of attainment or ability”. However, he did not consider the term so broad so as to cover all forms of financial assistance to tertiary education: As at 1976 tertiary bursaries, the form of assistance the appellant elected not to receive, would have been classified as a “bursary” for the purposes of sec 61(37). That proposition, which was accepted by both counsel in this Court, does not involve any direct conflict with Quilliam J’s view that “bursar” connotes some merit qualification, as it is plain that to obtain entry to training college a student was required to meet stated academic standards. At most it may involve a different emphasis from that placed by Quilliam J on the significance of merit. If so, it should in my view suffice to satisfy the merit criteria if the term “bursar” be restricted to a person who meets qualifying standards of attainment or ability without 16 the “bursar” being required to achieve the degree of competitive success or excellence or special merit expected of “scholars”. Nor does the proposition involve any conflict, direct or indirect, with Quilliam J’s view that the exemption cannot have intended to cover all forms of financial assistance to tertiary education. For example, an employee of a large company who was paid his normal salary while studying to gain the expertise necessary to introduce some new process to his employer’s business would not, in my view, receive such payments as bursary. \[Emphasis added\] 88. The term “bursary” has been given a wide meaning in Reid (CA) - the granting of financial assistance to a student meeting certain criteria to assist with their education. It includes payments that assist a recipient with their living costs. To receive a bursary, the person needs to meet the qualifying criteria or standards laid down for the specific bursary. In New Zealand, the term “bursary” most commonly refers to payments made from public funds to assist a tertiary student with their living costs. Importantly, payments made to a person while studying will not be a bursary, unless the primary purpose of the payments is to assist with the person’s education. 89. The other cases on the predecessor to s CW 36 did not consider the meaning of “bursary” in any detail. In Drew, the taxpayer had received a $700 annual bursary before a change in the arrangement with his employer. However, the court did not consider the characteristics of this payment because the exempt treatment of the payment was not disputed. In Case P23, Willy DJ considered that a bursary was a grant of financial assistance for educational purposes. Barber DJ in Case T46 remarked on “bursary”, after having considered the meaning of “scholarship” in terms of the predecessor to s CW 36, at 8,317: The indicia of a “bursary” are that merit need not have so much significance; and financial need is often more important. 90. Overall the cases have adopted a similar meaning to “bursary” as was given in Reid (CA). Ordinary meaning of “scholarship” 91. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines “scholarship” as follows: a grant made to support a student’s education, awarded on the basis of achievement. 92. Similar to the ordinary meaning of “bursary”, the above definition suggests a scholarship is a sum of money paid to a student. It is a payment granted to a person to assist their education, based usually on merit or achievement. Case law on the meaning of scholarship 93. The leading New Zealand case on the meaning of “scholarship” is also Reid (CA). Richardson J considered the dictionary meaning of “scholarship”, at 5,184: “Scholarship” is defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary as “the status of emoluments of a scholar at a school, college or university”, and “scholar” is defined for this purpose as “a student who receives emoluments, during a fixed period, from the funds of a school, college, or university, towards defraying the cost of his education or studies, and as a reward of merit”. 94. However, Richardson J did not find the dictionary definition of “scholarship” very satisfactory because, in his view, it did not take account of the common usage of the term in New Zealand. He continued, at 5,184: I am satisfied that these dictionary definitions of those words do not fully capture the wide meaning which they have in New Zealand usage. Speaking of the meaning of scholarship in Victoria in 1965, Adam J in Re Leitch \[1965\] VR 204, at p 206 said: “I am not prepared to hold that according to common usages of speech, or by reason of any authoritative definition, the word ‘scholarship’ in the absence of expressed purposes or conditions attached to it, connotes anything more than the grant of an emolument, 17 normally in a sum of money, to a scholar selected on merit or upon some other rational criterion.” And Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “scholarship” as “a sum of money or its equivalent offered (as by an educational institution, a public agency, or a private organisation or foundation) to enable a student to pursue his studies at a school, college, or university”. When one considers the number and range of awards designated as scholarships in New Zealand, those wider definitions seem equally reflective of common usage in this country. 95. The discussions in Reid (CA) suggest that “scholarship” has a wide meaning and is a sum of money or its equivalent granted to a student. It is granted, usually by a public or independent private body with the primary purpose of assisting the student to pursue their studies. The student is selected on merit or some other rational criterion. The above also suggests that the student’s study is at a school, college or university. This would appear consistent with the additional requirement of s CW 36 that the scholarship is “for attendance at an educational institution”. The meaning of this phrase is discussed later. 96. In Re Leitch \[1965\] VR 204 Adam J considered the meaning of “scholarship” at 206, as cited in Reid (CA) and followed in Drew. He considered it to be, at 206: a grant of an emolument, normally in a sum of money, to a scholar selected on merit or upon some other rational criterion. 97. In Case T46 Barber DJ looked at the discussion on the meaning of “scholarship” in Reid (CA) and concluded, at 8,317: Our case law establishes that the indicia of a “scholarship” are a grant of an emolument, normally a sum of money; the need for financial assistance is not usually a consideration; it is usually awarded on merit in recognition of achievement; and there may be a condition requiring the person to return and provide services for the payer. The indicia of a “bursary” are that merit need not have so much significance; and financial need is often more important. 98. From the above it can be seen that both a bursary and a scholarship have the element of granting financial assistance for educational purposes. Case law also suggests receiving a bursary or scholarship may be subject to conditions on the recipient to provide services to or on behalf of the payer. The granting of a scholarship will involve some selection based on merit or other achievement criteria whereas a bursary may be granted based on the meeting of certain eligibility criteria, often financial needs-based. In either case, in the Commissioner’s view, the payer selects the recipient according to some pre- defined criteria. In the Commissioner’s view, the more rigorous the application process and the greater the independence between the payer and the recipient, the easier it is for a recipient to demonstrate that the payment is a scholarship or bursary. 99. For example, an issue that often arises in the context of s CW 36 is whether a payment is a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36 or salary and wages by reason of an employment relationship. This distinction is important because, as seen above, the courts have established that if the true character of the amounts received is not for the dominant purpose of education but is primarily a payment of salary and wages under an employment relationship, then it is not a scholarship or bursary within s CW 36. This Interpretation Statement has outlined the factors the courts have considered to be relevant in this context at \[55\] above. 100. The Commissioner has published specific guidance on whether a retraining payment paid to a former employee would meet the requirements of what is now s CW 36 (s ee “Retraining payments made on employment termination – 18 assessability”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995): 6). Generally, a retraining payment paid to a former employee will be salary and wages and not a scholarship or bursary that meets the requirements of s CW 36. Conclusion on the meaning of “scholarship or bursary” 101. Based on the above, the Commissioner concludes the following:  A “bursary” or “scholarship” is usually granted by a public body or an independent private body to enable the recipient to pursue their education, but may also be granted in circumstances where a special relationship exists between the payer and the recipient.  A bursary is a sum of money, or its equivalent, granted to a person meeting certain criteria (often needs-based) for the primary purpose of assisting the recipient with funding their education.  A scholarship is a sum of money, or its equivalent, granted to a person for the primary purpose of assisting them to pursue their studies. The recipient is selected on merit or some other criteria.  Where a special relationship exists between the payer and the recipient, it may be harder to show that the dominant purpose of a payment is to assist the recipient with their studies because there may be competing reasons for the payment.  The granting of a scholarship or bursary may be on the condition that the recipient is required to provide services for, or on behalf of, the payer. However, the true character of the scholarship or bursary must be to assist the recipient’s education, and the payment must not be primarily for the payer to receive some other benefit, such as services, from the recipient. Is the scholarship or bursary for attendance at an “educational institution”? 102. Section CW 36 requires a scholarship or bursary to be primarily for the recipient’s attendance at an “educational institution”. It is, therefore, necessary to determine what “educational institution” means in s CW 36. 103. The term “educational institution” is not defined in the Act. The cases that have considered the exemption do not discuss the meaning of the term. In those cases it was implicit that the various organisations running the courses that the taxpayers were attending or intending to attend were “educational institutions”. The educational institutions were all tertiary institutions: universities (Drew, Case L30, Case L35, Case M24, Case P23 and Case T46), a technical institution (Case M66) and a teacher’s training college (Reid (CA)). 104. These cases are consistent with the meaning of the term “institution”, as specifically defined in s 159(1) of the Education Act 1989: (a) a college of education; or (b) a polytechnic; or (ba) a specialist college; or (c) a university; or (d) a wananga: 105. This definition of “institution” indicates that, for the Education Act 1989, the term “institution” means one of a prescribed list of tertiary education providers that have been established through a statutory process (see s 162 of the Education Act 1989). Section 162 details how each body is established and its 19 characteristics. While this definition of “institution” is helpful in determining the meaning of “educational institution” in s CW 36, the Commissioner considers that the meaning in s CW 36 is not limited to “institution” as defined in the Education Act 1989. 106. The meanings of “education” and “institution” are considered separately before considering the composite term. Ordinary meaning of “education” 107. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “education” as: the process of educating or being educated; systematic instruction and “educate” as: give intellectual, moral, and social instruction to; train or give information on a particular subject. Case law on the meaning of “education” 108. The Supreme Court of New South Wales discussed the meanings of “education” and the related term “educational purpose” in FCT v Hall (1975) 75 ATC 4,156. This case considers s 23(z) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust). That section is similar in context to s CW 36 and exempts from income tax “income derived by way of a scholarship, bursary or other educational allowance or educational assistance ... by a student receiving full-time education at a school, college or university”. 109. The case concerns the grant of a research fellowship by the Asthma Foundation to a researcher studying for a doctorate in medicine at a university. The main issue was whether the grant was a scholarship or bursary within s 23(z) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) or a payment for services rendered under an employment relationship. 110. Rath J discussed the meaning of “education”, in the context of whether the purpose of the payment was for education, at 4,162 to 4,163: In Chesterman v F.C. of T. Starke J. said ((1923) 32 C.L.R. 362 at 400) that the essential idea of education is training or teaching. Isaacs J. said (pp. 385-6) that for purposes to be educational they must provide for the giving or imparting of instruction. In his view education connotes the sense of imparting knowledge or assisting and guiding the development of body and mind. "Within that orbit", he said, "the field is wide, and extends from elementary instruction in primary schools to the highest technical scientific teaching in Universities". In Lloyd v F.C. of T. ((1955) 93 C.L.R. 645), Kitto J., after referring to these views, said (at p. 676): "The conception is unquestionably much wider than mere book learning, and wider than any category of subjects which might be thought to comprise general education as distinguished from education in specialised subjects concerned primarily with particular occupations". In the same case Dixon C.J. referred (at p. 661) to "systematic methods or procedures for the inculcation of knowledge". On these authorities education involves the dual concepts of imparting of knowledge and system. In educational institutions the imparting of knowledge is performed by various methods and combination of methods. The simplest, and this is the one that features prominently in primary education, is the direct inculcation of knowledge by the teacher in the pupil. A more sophisticated form of instruction is discussion, the exchange of ideas between teacher and student, a form which finds classical expression in the dialogues of Plato. In advanced education the element of direct inculcation may have little prominence. The professor's lectures may be better understood by reading his notes than by hearing him speak. It is not unknown for the lecturer to deliver his lecture at a speed which permits of every word being taken down in long hand. There can be little or no understanding of the subject matter in such a procedure, and understanding comes later from a study of the notes. In higher education much of the instruction comes, not from the teacher, but from the books the student reads. Indeed the element in education that has been referred to as imparting of knowledge (thus suggesting a necessary teacher-student relationship) might be better 20 described as learning; and the process of learning may be fostered in many ways, without stress on the teacher-student relationship. More significant perhaps is the element of system. In all educational establishments there is a planned course of learning. It is primarily for the educator to plan the course of study, and the procedures of learning. Typically these procedures will involve reading, discussion and teaching, with the first two having the predominant role as the level of education advances. \[Emphasis added\] 111. The courts have considered the meaning of “education” in several cases when deciding whether an organisation had a charitable purpose, so was a charity. Charitable purposes include the “advancement of education” (see s YA 1). In this context, the courts have given “education” a wide meaning (see Royal Choral Society v Commrs of IR \[1943\] 2 All ER 101 (CA), Re South Place Ethical Society, Barralet v Attorney-General \[1980\] 3 All ER 918 (Ch); Re Dupree's Trusts, Daley v Lloyds Bank \[1944\] 2 All ER 443 (Ch), Royal College of Surgeons of England v National Provincial Bank \[1952\] AC 631 (HL), Crystal Palace Trustees v Minister of Town & Country Planning \[1951\] Ch 132 and In re Delius (decd), Emanuel v Rosen \[1957\] Ch 299. 112. While the meaning of “education” in the charitable purposes context has been given a wide meaning, this wide meaning is consistent with the view that education involves the imparting of knowledge or learning (by various methods) and requires an element of system (a planned course of learning). Education extends from elementary instruction in primary schools to the highest technical scientific teaching in universities. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “education”. Ordinary meaning of “institution” 113. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “institution” as: a society or organisation founded esp. for charitable, religious, educational, or social purposes. 114. The ordinary meanings suggest that an “educational institution” is an organisation founded to give training on a particular subject by way of systematic instruction. Case law on the meaning of “institution” 115. Lord Macnaghten described an institution in the following terms in Mayor, etc of Manchester v McAdam (Surveyor of Taxes) \[1896\] AC 500 (HL) at 511: It is a little difficult to define the meaning of the term ‘institution’ in the modern acceptation of the word. It means, I suppose, an undertaking formed to promote some defined purpose, having in view generally the instruction or education of the public. It is the body (so to speak) called into existence to translate the purpose as conceived in the minds of the founders into a living and active principle. \[Emphasis added\] 116. Both the ordinary meaning and common law meaning suggest an institution is a society or organisation founded for a particular purpose and to actively implement that purpose by instructing the public. Since s CW 36 is concerned with an “educational institution”, an institution within the provision would have to be founded for educational purposes and to actively educate. Meaning of “educational institution” 117. In South Africa, Grosskopf J in ITC 1262 39 SATC 114 looked at the meaning of “educational institution” in s 10(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (SA). That section exempts from income “the receipts and accruals of all ecclesiastical, charitable and educational institutions of a public character”. The issue in this case was whether a company that had as its main object the promotion of travel 21 by students as an integral part of their education was an “educational institution” within the meaning of the provision. 118. Grosskopf J considered whether “educational” should be given the wide meaning it had been given in charities cases or should be limited to formal education. He stated, at 120: This, however, brings me back to the original question: where is the line to be drawn? No doubt foreign travel can be educational in the wide sense in which the acquisition of all knowledge or experience is considered educational. However, as I have already said, it is common cause that this is not the sense in which the word is used in the Act,... 119. Grosskopf J then concluded on the meaning of “educational institution”, at 120: To sum up: I consider that the concept of education which the legislature had in mind when exempting ‘educational institutions’ from tax requires at least an element of systematic or formal instruction, schooling or training. And an institution is ‘educational’, in my view, if its sole or at least main purpose or activity is to provide education in that sense. \[Emphasis added\] 120. The above case confirms the meaning that “institution” was given in Mayor, etc of Manchester. Additionally, it suggests that to be an “educational institution”, an institution’s sole, or at least main, purpose or activity needs to be to provide education that requires an element of systematic or formal instruction, schooling or training. This is consistent with the meaning of “education” in FCT v Hall. 121. In New Zealand, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) manages the New Zealand Qualifications Framework and provides independent quality assurance of education providers. Section CW 36 does not require an educational institution to be NZQA-approved. However, the fact an institution is NZQA- approved may be an indicator it is an educational institution offering formal and planned courses of learning. Conclusion on the meaning of “educational institution” 122. From the above, it can be seen that courts have given “education” a wide meaning. It involves the imparting of knowledge and requires a planned, systematic course of learning. It can also be seen that an “institution” is a society or an organisation founded for a particular purpose that it actively pursues. 123. The Commissioner considers an “educational institution” in s CW 36 is a society or an organisation founded for the sole or main purpose of promoting education and that actively provides that education. Education involves the imparting of knowledge through a systematic formal course of learning. The institution could be in New Zealand or overseas. In New Zealand, educational institutions include, but are not limited to schools, universities, wānanga, polytechnics and industry training organisations. Is the scholarship or bursary “for attendance at” an educational institution? 124. For s CW 36 to apply, the scholarship or bursary must be “for attendance at” an educational institution. Therefore, what “for attendance at” means must be determined. The phrase “for attendance at” is not defined in the Act. Ordinary meaning “for attendance at” 125. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary relevantly defines “attendance” as: the action or state of attending 126. and “attend” as: be present at; go regularly to (a school, church, or clinic). 22 127. The Concise Oxford Dictionary relevantly defines “present” as: Being or occurring in a particular place. 128. The Oxford English Dictionary (online, accessed 25 August 2015) relevantly defines “attendance” as: The action or condition of applying one's mind or observant faculties to something; The action of coming or fact of being present, in answer to a summons, or to take part in public business, entertainment, instruction, worship, etc. 129. The ordinary meaning suggests that attendance can mean the being at or going to a particular place (regularly or not). It can also mean the taking part in or applying one’s mind to something. Case law on the meaning of “attendance” 130. None of the cases discussed earlier on the predecessors to s CW 36 considered the meaning of “attendance at an educational institution”. 131. However, the Court of Appeal implicitly accepted in Reid that the trainee teachers were in attendance at the teachers’ college. The trainee teachers were required under their course of study to physically attend the teachers’ college, but also to physically attend schools outside the teachers’ college. This shows that the court accepted that “attendance at an educational institution” under the predecessor to s CW 36 was not restricted to physical attendance at the educational institution itself. It could also include going to a different location to fulfil the requirements or obligations of the particular formal course of education offered by the educational institution. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “attendance at”. 132. Other jurisdictions have looked at what constitutes attendance at a school, university or similar. 133. The United Kingdom Court of Appeal decision in Flemming v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions \[2002\] EWCA Civ 641 was a social security case. It concerned whether a daughter was entitled to an invalid care allowance under s 70 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (UK) (“1992 Act”) for caring for her disabled mother. The daughter had commenced a degree course at a university. Section 70 of the 1992 Act provides that a person is not entitled to an allowance under the section if the person is “receiving full-time education”. Regulation 5 of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 sets out that for the purposes of s 70 of the 1992 Act: ...a person shall be treated as receiving full-time education for any period during which he attends a course of education at a university, college, school or other educational establishment for twenty-one hours or more a week. \[Emphasis added\] 134. One of the issues was whether the word “attends” was, as submitted for the claimant, only physical presence at the university. Pill LJ stated on this issue at \[17\]: I would construe the expression "attends a course of education at a university" in the sense of being enrolled upon such a course at the university. In ordinary language, the student who says he attends a course of education at Glamorgan University is saying no more than that he is enrolled upon and pursuing such a course offered by the University. The expression does not have the locational connotation for which Mr Stagg argues. Some of the student's time will almost inevitably be spent in study upon the premises of a university but the hours during which he is attending the course of education are not confined to the hours on the premises. Hours of study away from the premises of the university are capable of coming within the period during which the student is attending the course of education. This construction is supported by the presence of the word "attending" in reg 5(3). The word does not have a locational limitation in that context and it would be surprising if the 23 word attendance has a different meaning in two paragraphs of the same Regulation, as Mr Stagg contends it has. \[Emphasis added\] 135. Several Canadian cases have looked at what “attendance as a full-time student” means within the definition of “dependent son” and “dependent daughter” in s 2(1)(b)(i) of the Immigration Regulations 1978, SOR/78-172. Whether someone is a dependent son or daughter determines whether they can be included in a parent’s principal application for a permanent residence visa. In the Federal Court decision in Dhami v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) \[2001\] FCT 805, Dawson J stated at \[43\]: I conclude that because the regulatory definition speaks of both enrollment and attendance, a visa officer is obliged to look beyond the mere fact of registration in a program of study. The reference in the definition to "attendance" is, in my view, for the purpose of testing the reality of a claim to full-time student status. The visa officer must inquire whether an applicant is simply enrolled on paper or whether an applicant is actually engaged in a bona fide manner in a program of study. \[Emphasis added\] 136. In the same context, the Canadian Court of Appeal in Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v Jagwinder Singh Sandhu 2002 FCA 79 stated in \[20\] and \[21\]: \[20\] In my view, the words "enrolled and in attendance as a full-time student" require that the student, on a continuous basis, make a bona fide attempt to assimilate the material of the subjects in which the student is enrolled. \[21\] This does not suggest that a student must be either successful in the examinations or that the student have acquired a mastery of the subject. What is required is a genuine effort on the part of the student to acquire the knowledge that the course seeks to impart. \[Emphasis added\] 137. While the above cases look at attendance in a different context and may not be directly relevant to the meaning of “attendance at an educational institution” in s CW 36, they are, however, consistent with the ordinary meaning of the term. They are also consistent with the decision in Reid (CA) that “attendance” in the context of an educational course has an aspect of actively taking part in or genuinely pursuing the particular course of education. 138. Attendance is not limited to a certain location, so a student can still be “attending at an educational institution” when not on the premises of the educational institution. In the Commissioner’s view, it therefore follows, that a student will be attending at an educational institution even when they are attending remotely (eg, by being enrolled in and actively pursuing a distance learning programme of an educational institution) or when required to attend at premises other than those of the educational institution. This is consistent with the commonly accepted usage of the word “attendance” today. For example, under ordinary usage a person is regarded as attending a meeting when dialling into a meeting over the internet or phone without being at the physical place where the meeting is held. Further, it is acceptable to refer to people as “attending at” court when giving evidence remotely or in person. Conclusion on the meaning of “attendance at” 139. From the above, it can be seen “attendance”, in the context of an educational course, can be the student’s physical presence at the location where the course is being held or the student being enrolled and pursuing the educational course if it involves requirements other than physical presence, or a combination of both. 140. The Commissioner considers a scholarship or bursary will be for “attendance at an educational institution” when the payment is for a person to enrol and take part in a formal course of education offered by an educational institution. 24 Who derives a scholarship or bursary? 141. Another question that is sometimes important to resolve is who derives the scholarship or bursary. For example, sometimes, a bursary might take the form of a regular payment that is used to meet a student’s school fees that the student’s parents would otherwise pay. 142. In the Commissioner’s view a scholarship or bursary is derived by the scholar or bursar (ie, the person who is attending at the educational institution), and not by the recipient’s parents, even though the parents may use the payment to meet their child’s education costs. This is because it is the student who has qualified for and been granted the scholarship or bursary, and the amount is paid to assist that student with their attendance at an educational institution. 143. Before s CW 36 was rewritten, the predecessor exemption in s CB 9(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provided that the exemption from income was for “any amount derived by any person from any maintenance or allowance provided for or paid to that person in respect of his or her attendance at an educational institution in terms of a scholarship or bursary”. This wording made it clear that the income exemption is for scholarship or bursary income derived by a person for their attendance at an educational institution. There was no intended policy change to this position when the Income Tax Act was rewritten. Examples 144. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of s CW 36. They assume the payments are amounts of income. Example 1 - Scholarship for course requiring practical work aspect 145. Ruby is enrolled in a relaxation massage course at the Holistic Centre of Massage Therapies Ltd. Graduates who successfully complete the full-time one year course gain the Certificate in Relaxation Massage. The course includes components such as anatomy and physiology and the theory and practice of massage. Half of the time spent on the course is practice-based massage at a clinic the centre works with to enable the application of the students’ knowledge and skills in a supervised clinical environment. The centre was founded with the mission to produce multi-skilled graduates with a broad knowledge base in massage. The centre’s purpose is to teach massage therapies. The centre and the course both have NZQA approval. 146. Ruby has been granted a Women’s Restart Education Scholarship by a local community trust. The scholarship reimburses her for the first year course fee of $5,000 and pays $12,000 in monthly instalments of $1,000 per month over 12 months while she is pursuing her studies. The payments are intended to financially assist female students who, through a change in circumstances, are studying full time towards a nationally recognised qualification. The payments will be stopped if Ruby pulls out of the course. 147. The payments are exempt income under s CW 36 because:  they are not a “basic grant” or an “independent circumstances grant” under s 303 of the Education Act 1989;  they are a scholarship or bursary because they are granted to Ruby (who meets the criteria laid down for the payments) to assist her education financially. 148. The centre is an educational institution because it was founded for the sole purpose of teaching massage and related therapies and it actively runs systematic 25 formal courses for this purpose. Section CW 36 does not require an educational institution to be NZQA approved. However, the fact that the centre is NZQA approved may indicate that it is an educational institution that offers formal and planned courses of learning. 149. Ruby receives the payments “for attendance at the educational institution” because she is enrolled in the formal course, relaxation massage, and takes part in this course by fulfilling the obligations, (ie, attending theory classes at the centre and practice-based training at the clinic. Attending the practice-based half of the course at the clinic outside the centre’s premises is part of fulfilling the obligations of the course, so is part of attendance at the educational institution. Example 2 - Literary residency not a scholarship or bursary 150. William, a young author, has applied for and is granted a literary residency by a New Zealand university. He is provided with an office in the English Department of the university for 12 months and receives the minimum salary of a full-time university lecturer over this period. The grant has been created to foster New Zealand writing by providing an opportunity to write full time within an academic environment for the period of tenure. 151. William would like to know whether the grant he receives is exempt income under s CW 36. 152. While the university is an educational institution as referred to in s CW 36 and the payments are to assist William’s education in a broad sense, they are not “for attendance at an educational institution” within the meaning of the term in s CW 36. This is because William is not enrolled in, and does not pursue, a planned, formal course of education at the university. The payments are to provide William with the opportunity to further his skills in his profession and to focus on his professional work and projects during the period. The payments are not exempt from tax under s CW 36. Example 3 - Employment income rather than a scholarship or bursary 153. Kiri is working full time in a garden centre. She would like to gain a Certificate in Floristry Practice at the North Island Institute of Technology. The course is a one- year full-time course requiring attendance at the institute as well as some online course participation. 154. The garden centre like having Kiri as an employee and does not want to lose her. To encourage her to stay working for it long term, the garden centre offers to financially assist Kiri with her studies. The garden centre and Kiri sign an agreement whereby the garden centre agrees to pay her a fortnightly bursary payment for the duration of her studies equivalent to the amount she earned before studying full time. In return, Kiri is required to work in the garden centre on weekends (without pay) while studying and guarantees that after completing her studies she will work full time for the garden centre for two years or repay 75% of the payments made to her during the study period. 155. Kiri would like to know whether the payments she will receive from the garden centre while she is studying floristry practice are exempt income under s CW 36. 156. The payments Kiri will receive from the garden centre while she is studying are not exempt income under s CW 36. This is because the true character of the payments is that of employment income rather than of a scholarship or bursary for attendance at an educational institution. 157. This is supported by the following: 26  An existing employment relationship exists between Kiri and the garden centre at the time Kiri enrols in the educational course and this relationship continues throughout the study period.  The garden centre’s principal purpose in making the payments is to ensure that it retains Kiri’s services. The provision of financial assistance while Kiri is studying is only a secondary purpose of the garden centre.  Kiri is required to work for the garden centre (on weekends) during the period of study.  The amount of the fortnightly bursary the garden centre pays is equivalent to Kiri’s previous salary.  Kiri is required to repay a significant portion of the money the garden centre pays during her study period, if she does not work for the garden centre for two years after finishing her studies. Example 4 – Distance learning course 158. Callum is enrolled in an online business studies distance learning course through an NZQA approved business school. Graduates who successfully complete the one-year full-time course gain a Certificate in Business Studies. Callum has been granted a scholarship by his local Chamber of Commerce to assist him with his course costs and living expenses while he studies. 159. The scholarship is exempt income under s CW 36 because:  it is not a basic grant or an independent circumstances grant under s 303 of the Education Act 1989; and  it is granted to Callum (who meets the criteria laid down for the payments and who has no special relationship with the Chamber of Commerce) to assist with him pursuing his education. 160.

supplies made and 1. received by retirement villages. It follows the publication of Interpretation Statement IS 10/08 “Retirement villages – GST treatment” in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 11 (December 2010). IS 10/08 considers the GST treatment of retirement villages as it was before the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 and other subsequent amendments took effect. When IS 10/08 was published it was known retirement villages would be affected by amendments to the GSTA and that a further public item would be required. Therefore, this Interpretation Statement considers the GST treatment of retirement villages, taking into account the current definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” in s 2, the current GST apportionment provisions and the zero-rating of land rules as they apply to land acquired for the development of retirement villages. Summary This Interpretation Statement addresses the GST treatment of supplies made by 2. retirement villages to their residents, the entitlement of retirement village operators to claim input tax deductions for goods or services used in establishing and operating a retirement village, and the GST treatment of land acquired for the development of retirement villages. Some examples illustrating the GST treatment of retirement villages are provided 3. at \[222\]–\[236\]. Supplies made by retirement villages To determine whether GST is chargeable on supplies made by a retirement village 4. to its residents it is necessary to consider the nature of the supplies being made. This is done by considering the rights and obligations created under the contracts entered into between retirement villages and their residents. In turn, the nature of the supplies made by a retirement village will determine a retirement village’s entitlement to claim input tax deductions for goods or services used in establishing or operating a retirement village. Retirement villages essentially supply accommodation and care services to their 5. residents. The main legal structures used to provide residents with occupation rights in a retirement village are sales, leases or licences of accommodation units, although the precise details of arrangements vary from village to village, and from resident to resident. For example, under some schemes a retirement village may be obliged to repurchase an accommodation unit or alternatively a village may only have an option to repurchase the unit. Sometimes a retirement village will provide care services to residents along with occupation rights, or in other situations care services may be provided separately to residents, in addition to accommodation. The nature of the different supplies made by a retirement 3 village and the consideration received for those supplies are considered at \[32\]– \[99\]. Usually, supplies by a retirement village of accommodation in a “commercial 6. dwelling” (as opposed to a “dwelling”) and supplies of care services will be taxable supplies made by retirement villages to residents. Common exempt supplies made by a retirement village are: 7.  The supply of financial services (the allotment or issue of a debt security): ss 3(1)(c) and 14(1)(a). The meaning of “debt security” is considered at \[47\]–\[56\].  The supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy: s 14(1)(c). The meaning of “accommodation” is considered at \[69\]–\[71\] and the meaning of “dwelling” is discussed at \[106\]–\[123\]. The Commissioner considers that a retirement village makes a supply of a 8. financial service (the allotment of a debt security) under any transaction (eg, under the sale, lease or licence of a unit) where the retirement village accepts an obligation to repurchase that unit or agrees to repay a loan or deposit. That financial service is supplied for no consideration. The provision of financial services is considered at \[101\]–\[103\]. Where a resident’s right to occupy a unit in a retirement village is supplied under 9. a lease or licence then that supply of accommodation by the retirement village may be an exempt supply under s 14(1)(c). For s 14(1)(c) to apply, accommodation must be supplied in a dwelling (but not in a commercial dwelling). Paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” in s 2 includes a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the unit is for the right to occupy the unit. To determine if para (b)(iii) applies to a supply of accommodation by a retirement village in a residential unit, it is necessary to:  identify the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay for the right to occupy that unit; and  determine whether such consideration is for the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner considers that para (b)(iii) does not apply to units whose 10. residents are required to purchase a package of care services. In those circumstances the units will form part of a commercial dwelling, so that the supply of accommodation in the units under a lease or licence is a taxable supply. The issue of whether s 14(1)(c) applies to exempt the supply of accommodation in a retirement village is considered at \[ 104\]–\[105\]. Some retirement villages may also supply a participatory security under which 11. residents have a right to use the common areas and facilities in the village. On its own, the supply of such a participatory security would be an exempt supply under s 14(1)(a). However, where a retirement village scheme includes a participatory security under which an associated supply is made (eg, the right to receive the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling for no consideration or for a consideration that is below the open market value), the consideration attributable to the supply of accommodation will be subject to GST. In those situations, the taxable supply of accommodation is an “associated supply” and s 14(1)(a) does not exempt the associated supply: s 14(1B). The associated supply is treated as a separate taxable supply: s 5(14B). This issue is considered at \[ 142\]–\[154\]. 4 A table summarising the GST treatment of the key supplies made by retirement 12. villages is provided as Appendix 1. Claims for input tax deductions by retirement villages Whether an input tax deduction can be claimed on goods and services acquired 13. by a retirement village depends on the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies. To determine the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time the goods or services are acquired how they intend to use them, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. A full input tax deduction is allowed for a good or service that is used solely for 14. making taxable supplies (ie, that is used for making supplies of accommodation in a commercial dwelling or other taxable supplies). In contrast, no input tax deduction is allowed for a good or service that is solely used for making exempt supplies (ie, in this context typically a good or service used for making supplies of accommodation in a dwelling or a financial service). Where goods or services are used for making both taxable supplies and exempt 15. supplies, then the retirement village operator must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. The intention of the operator can include their overall plan or aim (where that provides a fair and reasonable result). This issue is discussed at \[ 175\]–\[177\]. The determination is expressed as a percentage of the total use. There must be objective evidence of the intended use of the good or service (eg, resource consent applications, feasibility studies and preliminary designs to support the intended use of land). An adjustment may be needed if the use of a good or service changes in an adjustment period from what was originally estimated when the good or service was acquired. The rules relating to adjustments are discussed at \[185\]–\[207\]. The above rules do not apply to supplies where GST has been charged at the rate 16. of 0% (zero-rated). Input tax deductions will not be available where a good or service has been acquired as a zero-rated supply, and sometimes an amount of output tax may be payable where the zero-rated good or service will be used for making non-taxable supplies. The most important zero-rated supply in the context of retirement villages is the zero-rated supply of land for development. Land purchased or sold by retirement villages There are special GST rules for the supply of land: the zero-rating of land rules. 17. These rules may apply to land acquired for the development of a retirement village. The rules require the supply of land to be zero-rated when (at the time of settlement):  the supply wholly or partly consists of land;  the vendor and purchaser are registered for GST;  the purchaser intends to use the supplied goods (ie, the land and the other components of the supply) wholly or partly for making taxable supplies; and  the purchaser does not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for themselves or for a person associated with them under s 2A(1)(c). The zero-rating of land rules are considered at \[208\]–\[221\]. 18. 5 Background Features of retirement villages A retirement village is a complex that is used for the provision of accommodation 19. to retirees: Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,003 (HC). A central concept of retirement villages is the provision of accommodation: Norfolk Apartments Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,212 (CA). Another feature of retirement villages is the provision of community facilities to residents. Care and other services may also be provided in a retirement village. The services other than accommodation that are provided to residents may vary from village to village. Residents within a retirement village may also receive different levels of care and services. The Commissioner has referred to several sources that contain a broad outline of 20. the legal and financial structure of arrangements between retirement villages and their residents. The Commissioner has also considered a range of contracts used for particular retirement villages. These indicate that the main legal structures used for the provision of occupation rights in retirement villages are:  sales of units to residents;  leases of units or accommodation to residents; or  licences of units or accommodation to residents. The latter two legal structures are typically labelled Occupational Rights 21. Agreements or ORAs. This Interpretation Statement focuses on the GST treatment of these two legal structures, although some analysis on the GST treatment of supplies made to residents who purchase their unit in a retirement village is included. The financial structures commonly entered into between retirement villages and 22. their residents are broadly as follows:  Generally, residents are required to pay a lump sum payment on entry to the retirement village (referred to in this Interpretation Statement as “the entry payment”), which, in legal terms, is either the purchase price for a unit or an interest-free loan or refundable deposit paid by the resident to the retirement village.  The entry payment may include a separate component (commonly known as the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”), which is treated as payment for either the provision of community facilities or management services. A retirement village may be entitled to take the facilities fee or amenities contribution up front or the fee may accrue to the retirement village over a period of years. If the entry payment does not include a facilities fee or amenities contribution, then usually the facilities fee or amenities contribution is payable when the resident leaves the village and is deducted from the amount that is repayable to the resident.  Residents are also required to pay periodic fees which are a proportionate share of village overheads such as rates, insurance, security, management expenses and maintenance.  An additional payment or a higher periodic fee may be chargeable where residents receive other additional services such as laundry, cleaning, nursing and meals.  Residents may also be required to pay refurbishment costs relating to their unit when they leave the village. 6  Residents may be required to pay a termination charge or the legal costs incurred by the retirement village in granting the occupation right.  The amount that is repaid to the resident when they leave the village will often be less than the amount originally paid by the resident, when the amounts owed by the resident up to departure are set off against the original amount paid. Residents may not be entitled to share in the capital gain on their units and, if they are entitled to do so, a higher entry payment may be required. It is not possible in the context of an Interpretation Statement to address every 23. type of arrangement that may be entered into between retirement villages and their residents. This Interpretation Statement deals with sales, leases and licences (which as indicated at \[20\] are the main legal structures used in retirement villages) and the financial structures outlined above. The principles outlined in this Interpretation Statement are intended to be relevant in the majority of cases. Key issues considered in this Interpretation Statement This Interpretation Statement considers three key GST issues relevant to 24. retirement villages:  the GST treatment of supplies made by retirement villages to their residents (discussed at \[26\]–\[154\]);  the entitlement of retirement villages to claim input tax deductions for goods or services used in establishing and operating a retirement village (discussed at \[156\]–\[207\]; and  the GST treatment of land purchased or sold by retirement villages (discussed at \[208\]–\[221\]). Each of these key issues is considered in turn. 25. GST treatment of supplies made by retirement villages GST is chargeable on the supply of goods and services in the course or 26. furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by a registered person by reference to the value of the supply. Exempt supplies are not subject to GST: s 8(1). The value of a supply is the consideration paid for the supply: s 10(2). Where the 27. consideration relates to both a taxable supply and an exempt supply, it is necessary to identify the portion of the consideration that is attributable to each supply. Only the part of the consideration that is attributable to a taxable supply is subject to GST: s 10(18). To understand the GST treatment of the supply of goods and services by 28. retirement villages and to determine whether GST is chargeable on supplies made by a retirement village to its residents, it is first necessary to understand the supplies being made by a retirement village and the consideration relating to those supplies. Next, it is necessary to consider whether any of the supplies being made by the village are taxable or exempt supplies in terms of the GSTA. As a result, the approach taken in this Interpretation Statement is to first consider:  the nature of a supply generally for GST purposes;  the nature of the supplies made by retirement villages, taking into account the common legal structures (including payment arrangements) used by retirement villages; and 7  how those supplies are described in GST terms. The second step is to determine whether those identified supplies are taxable 29. supplies or exempt supplies for the purposes of the GSTA. Section 14 sets out those supplies that are exempt supplies. Therefore, the next step in the Interpretation Statement is to consider the application of s 14 to the supplies made by a retirement village, in particular:  s 14(1)(a): the provision of financial services; and  s 14(1)(c): the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”. In looking at s 14(1)(c) the meaning of “dwelling” will be considered, and in 30. particular:  what is consideration paid or payable for the right to occupy a unit;  whether a dwelling includes appurtenances; and  the meaning of “commercial dwelling”. The Interpretation Statement then briefly considers supplies associated with the 31. issue of a participatory security and whether an associated supply is a taxable supply. Nature of a supply The nature of a supply for GST purposes is determined by considering the legal 32. rights and obligations between the parties in the light of the surrounding circumstances. The Court of Appeal in CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 33. 18,915 and CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126 confirmed that the principles in Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA) are to be applied in determining the nature of a supply. To determine the nature of a supply, it is necessary to consider the legal rights and obligations entered into between the parties in the light of the surrounding circumstances. The relevant principles were stated by Richardson J in Marac as follows (at 5,098): The true nature of a transaction can only be ascertained by careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out: not on an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction measured by the results intended and achieved or of the overall economic consequences. The nomenclature used by the parties is not decisive and what is crucial is the ascertainment of the legal rights and duties which are actually created by the transaction into which the parties entered. The surrounding circumstances may be taken into account in characterising the transaction. Not to deny or contradict the written agreement but in order to understand the setting in which it was made and to construe it against that factual background having regard to the genesis and objectively the aim of the transaction. Of course the documentation may be a sham hiding the true agreement or its implementation. Or there may be a statutory provision mandating a broader or different approach. But at common law there is no halfway house between sham and characterisation of the transaction, according to the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out. Where a single supplier makes a supply of a package of services or a package of 34. goods and services, the elements in the transaction may be so closely linked that objectively they constitute a single supply. The courts have developed a number of principles to help determine the relevant “supply” (or supplies) made pursuant to a transaction. The leading New Zealand case on whether a component is a separate supply or part of a larger supply is Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC). This case concerned a taxpayer, the Auckland Institute of Studies (AIS), that specialised in providing educational services to overseas students. A subsidiary was incorporated to carry out AIS’s overseas activities. The subsidiary was entitled to charge the students an “overseas 8 assistance fee” for assistance provided to the students prior to their arrival in New Zealand. The students were not charged separately for the overseas assistance fee. Instead, it was part of the fee that was charged for tuition and other services. The issue was whether the overseas assistance fee was for a separate supply from the supply of tuition services such that the overseas assistance fee would be zero-rated. Hansen J reviewed the case law on the principles of apportionment and 35. considered that the cases in the United Kingdom under the Value Added Tax Act 1983 (UK) were of assistance. He observed that the approach of the United Kingdom courts had been to sever zero-rated or exempt supplies where it was “practicable and realistic” to do so (Rayner & Keeler Ltd v C & E Commrs \[1991\] VATTR 532 at 538). He stated that, for this purpose, an enquiry is made into “the true and substantial nature” of the consideration given for the payment (Bophuthatswana National Commercial Corp Ltd v C & E Commrs \[1993\] STC 702 (CA) at 708). In particular, Hansen J considered the following four cases:  British Airways plc v C & E Commrs \[1990\] BTC 5124 (CA);  C & E Commrs v United Biscuits (UK) Ltd \[1992\] BTC 5045 (CSIH);  C & E Commrs v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd \[1997\] BTC 5140 (EWCA CIV); and  Card Protection Plan Ltd v C & E Commrs \[2001\] 2 All ER 143 (HL). Ultimately Hansen J found that the pre-arrival services were ancillary to the supply of tuition services to overseas students in that they helped to facilitate that supply. The relevant principles taken from the above cases can be summarised as 36. follows:  To determine the nature of a supply it is necessary to identify the essential features of the transaction, by considering the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the parties. All the circumstances in which the transaction takes place must be considered.  There needs to be an objective examination of the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether a sufficient distinction can be made between the allegedly different parts of the consideration given to make it reasonable to sever and apportion them. If, on an objective examination, it is not reasonable to sever and apportion the consideration given then there will be only one supply.  The examination of the true and substantial nature of the consideration given involves determining whether one element of the transaction or consideration given is a necessary or integral part of another element or whether one element is merely ancillary to or incidental to another element. If an element of a transaction is merely ancillary to a principal/dominant element, there will be only one supply (including both the dominant and the ancillary elements).  A service will be ancillary to a principal service when it is not an aim in itself for customers, but is a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. More specifically, and relevant to this context, the Commissioner considers that 37. the principles that determine whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies include: 9  The examination of the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to identify the core supply (which may consist of a number of supplies that are integral to each other, none of which is the dominant element in the core supply).  A transaction involving the supply of a package of services, or a package of goods and services, is treated as a single supply in the following circumstances: - No one element in the transaction is the dominant element in the transaction and the elements in the transaction are so closely linked that, considered objectively, they form a single supply. Examples of such transactions include: the supply of distance learning courses, an essential component of which was the supply of written materials (College of Estate Management v C & E Commrs \[2005\] 4 All ER 933 (HL)); the supply of medical treatment, which required both the exercise of medical skill and the use of drugs (Dr Beynon v C & E Commrs \[2004\] 4 All ER 1091 (HL)); the supply of repair services, which required the repair of a vehicle by the replacement of defective parts (CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd (2005) 22 NZTC 19,126 (CA)); and restaurant transactions, which include the provision of food and a cluster of features and acts (C-231/94 Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg \[1996\] BTC 5391 (ECJ)). - The transaction includes the provision of minor or peripheral benefits that are optional extras and that are not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. In the Card Protection case, the House of Lords considered that, to the extent that the services supplied could not be categorised as insurance, they were ancillary or minor features of the insurance scheme that were not sufficiently coherent to be treated as a separate supply. In Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v R & C Commrs \[2007\] BTC 5210 (Ch), it was held that there was a single supply of membership of a club that conferred on a child the right to attendance at classes involving structured physical play. Other benefits received on admission to membership (a DVD, CD, gym bag, membership card, T- shirt, personal accident insurance for a child while attending a class, and a subscription for a magazine) did not alter the nature of the supply.  The requirement to consider the transaction from the perspective of a typical or average customer means no more than that the focus is on the supply actually made and not on whether a supply of goods or services could be made separately. In C & E Commrs v British Telecommunications plc \[1999\] 3 All ER 961 (HL), whether the car could have been supplied without the delivery service was irrelevant. The supply contracted for was the supply of a delivered car. In the Auckland Institute case the supply that students had contracted for was the supply of tuition services. Pre-arrival services (advice on courses to be undertaken, arrangements for accommodation and other matters relating to the welfare of students, immigration formalities and the completion of documentation for enrolment purposes) could have been provided by a third party under a separate contract. However, the court considered that the pre-arrival services (arranging payment of tuition fees, completion of enrolment and application forms) were ancillary to the supply of tuition in that they facilitated the students undertaking a course of study. Therefore, whether a service could be supplied separately is irrelevant in determining whether a single supply is 10 made. The focus is on the supply made under the contract with the customer.  Viewed in isolation, an ancillary feature of a transaction can be regarded as an independent supply. However, an ancillary feature is not in any real and substantial sense part of the consideration (objectively ascertained) for the payment made. An ancillary feature is a minor, peripheral and non- essential element of the transaction. It is a question of fact and degree whether the relationship between the elements in a transaction is such that the transaction cannot be regarded as a single supply.  Whether a separate charge is made, or whether a separate price can be identified, does not determine the legal nature of the transaction and cannot alter the essential features of the transaction. Section 5(14) is relevant if (applying the principles outlined above) it is 38. determined that only part of a supply is subject to GST at the standard rate: Interpretation Statement IS 08/01: “GST—Role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in regard to the zero-rating of part of a supply” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8. Nature of supplies made by retirement villages To determine the nature of the supplies made by retirement villages, it is 39. necessary to identify the essential features of the transaction between the retirement village and the resident. This effectively requires consideration of the contract entered into between a retirement village and its resident. Contracts may vary from village to village and not all residents within a particular village will receive the same services under their contracts. However, a broad outline of contracts entered into between retirement villages and their residents is possible. Generally, when a resident occupies a unit in a retirement village under a lease or 40. licence, the relationship between the retirement village and the resident includes these typical features:  Residents have the right to occupy a particular unit and the right, in common with other residents and other persons authorised by the operator, to use the common areas and facilities of the village.  Retirement village operators are obliged to manage the village, to repair and maintain the village and to provide a security system for the village.  An emergency alarm system is installed in units and an emergency response service is available to all residents.  Residents must pay the retirement village a loan or deposit that is repayable on termination of occupation.  Residents must also pay periodic fees that are calculated by reference to the costs of operating the village (ie, a proportionate share of village overheads such as rates, insurance, security, management expenses and maintenance). If residents purchase a package of care services, additional payments or higher periodic fees are payable.  A “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is payable either up front or on termination of a resident’s occupation. If the facilities fee or amenities contribution is an up-front payment, the retirement village may be entitled to take the payment immediately or the amount may accrue to the retirement village over a period. If the facilities fee or amenities contribution is payable on termination, it is set off against the loan or deposit repayable to the resident. 11  Residents may also be required to pay the cost of refurbishing their units and other charges on termination of occupation. In some cases, a resident’s contract obliges a retirement village operator to 41. supply a package of care services in addition to the right to occupy the unit. The lowest level care package will typically include daily or weekly visits by a nurse, emergency call monitoring, removal of rubbish from the apartment, weekly cleaning of the apartment, provision of communal transport, organised activities and outgoings, weekly change of towels and bed linen, weekly personal laundry, morning and afternoon teas and the main meal each day. The highest level care package will typically equate to full rest home care. Generally a higher periodic fee is charged where a care package is provided. If optional care or other services not included in a care package are supplied to residents at the request of residents, an additional charge is payable. Where a unit is sold to a resident, residents have the right to similar services to 42. those outlined above, including the right to use the common areas and facilities of the village. Generally, under the terms of the sale agreement, the retirement village accepts an obligation to repurchase the unit or is granted an option to purchase the unit at the end of the arrangement. When the nature of the supplies made by retirement villages to their residents are 43. considered in the context of the governing contracts, the consideration payable and the surrounding circumstances of those supplies may include (in GST terms):  the provision of financial services (in relation to deposits, loans or repurchase obligations) (discussed at \[45\]– \[ 65\]); and  the supply of accommodation by way of a lease or licence (discussed at \[66\]–\[99\]), including: - the supply of common areas and shared facilities (discussed at \[72\]– \[75\]); - the provision of operating and upkeep services and other additional services (discussed at \[76\]–\[77\]); and - the supply of care services (discussed at \[78\]–\[82\]). This Interpretation Statement addresses each of these possible supplies. 44. GST supplies made by retirement villages Provision of debt security The supply of a financial service is an exempt supply for GST purposes. For GST 45. purposes a retirement village supplies a financial service to a resident in the form of a debt security when a retirement village agrees under the contract with the resident to repay a loan or deposit or accepts an obligation to repurchase a unit from a resident. A “debt security” includes any right to be paid money in the future. It is a separate supply from the supply of accommodation to a resident. The following paragraphs discuss: 46.  the meaning of “debt security” in the GSTA;  the consideration payable for the supply of a debt security; and  whether the supply of a debt security is separate from the supply of accommodation. 12 Meaning of debt security The definition of “financial services” includes the issue, allotment, drawing, 47. acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: s 3(1)(c). In Case S54 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,354 at 7,357 Judge Willy said “it is a precondition 48. to the existence of a debt security that funds be invested in the form of a loan to the borrower”. Therefore, even if a narrow interpretation of “debt security” is adopted, a debt security may arise under a loan or refundable deposit. Most retirement village contracts involve a loan or deposit. However, the definition of “debt security” is not limited to loans or deposits. 49. Judge Willy, in Case S54, said that “it is appropriate to have regard to \[the Securities Act 1978\] in construing” the definition of debt security in the GSTA. The essence of the definition of “debt security” in the Securities Act 1978 was that money is deposited with or lent to a person, or is otherwise owing by that person, so that the investor retains an interest in the money or a right to be repaid: Francken v Ministry of Economic Development (HC Dunedin CRI 2008- 412-000025, 1 December 2008 at \[34\]). As under the GSTA, for Securities Act 1978 purposes the definition of debt security is satisfied if under the transaction an investor has an interest in or right to be paid money, regardless of the form of the transaction. In Culverden Retirement Village Ltd v Registrar of Companies \[1997\] 1 NZLR 257, the Privy Council considered that an arrangement, under which a unit was sold on the basis that a retirement village would repurchase the unit at a specified price, was a debt security under the Securities Act 1978. The definition of “debt security” includes any interest in or right to be paid money 50. that is, or is to be, owing by any person (excluding a cheque). As a result, a debt security includes a right to be paid money in the future. As noted above at \[47\], the definition of “financial services” includes the 51. allotment of a debt security. For the purpose of the Securities Act 1978, an allotment of a security is made by a person who offers securities to the public or who confers a right under a security (the issuer). Generally an allotment is made when the contract for the issue of the security is formed. This occurs when the issuer accepts a subscriber’s offer to purchase the security offered by the issuer. In exceptional cases, an allotment could take the form of dispositions of rights or interests: DFC Financial Services Ltd (in statutory management) v Abel \[1991\] 2 NZLR 619 (HC); Re Loan and Finance (Dunedin) Ltd (in rec) (1990) 5 NZCLC 66,367 (HC); Owers v Braemar Lodge 2004 Ltd (in rec) (2010) 10 NZCLC 264,677. The definition of “financial services” also includes the issue of a debt security 52. (above at \[47\]). The issue of a security generally involves the delivery of a document or some act (such as the entry of the holder’s name on the register) that perfects the title of the holder of the security: Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd v Inland Revenue Commrs \[1978\] 1 All ER 248 (CA); Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Ltd v Deutsche Hypothekenbank Frankfurt-Hamburg Aktiengesellschaft (2000) 8 NZCLC 262,208 (HC). Before the Retirement Villages Act 2003 was enacted, offers of securities by 53. retirement villages (being offers of securities to the public) were subject to the Securities Act 1978: Culverden; Fenton v Pakuranga Park Village Trust (1998) 3 NZConvC 192,681 (CA); Covenant Trustee Co v Ohope Lodge Ltd (HC Rotorua M69/90, 28 April 1993). Given there is no definition of “debt security” in the Retirement Villages Act 2003, the Commissioner considers it remains appropriate to have regard to the Securities Act 1978 (or its replacement the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013) in construing the definition of debt security in the GSTA. Therefore, the contractual analysis that applies to public offers applies to 13 retirement village schemes. A contract for the issue of a debt security is formed by a retirement village’s acceptance of a prospective resident’s offer. A debt security is allotted by the retirement village when it accepts the offer. The Commissioner considers that a retirement village supplies a financial service 54. (the allotment of a debt security) under any arrangement in which a resident of a retirement village is entitled to receive repayment of all or part of the lump sum payment paid on entry to the retirement village. This is so whether or not the arrangement is a loan in form. When a retirement village allots a debt security to a resident, the retirement village undertakes a contractual obligation to pay money to the resident on termination of occupation. As a result, the resident receives a financial service, being the acceptance of an obligation to pay money (the allotment of a debt security under which the resident has a right to be paid money). However, the Commissioner considers that a sale with an option to purchase in 55. favour of the retirement village will not be a debt security, as any right to receive money will be conditional on the option being exercised when occupation terminates. The most commonly accepted theory in relation to the nature of an option is that it is an offer to sell, coupled with a contract not to revoke the offer: Alexander v Tse \[1988\] 1 NZLR 318 (CA). The purchase price becomes payable only if a contract for the sale and purchase of a unit is formed when the option is exercised. The Commissioner accepts that in practice a retirement village that holds an option to purchase a unit will invariably exercise the option. However, where an option is granted in favour of a retirement village, the obligation on the part of the retirement village to pay the purchase price and the right of the resident to payment of the purchase price do not arise unless and until the option is exercised. By comparison, under an arrangement where a retirement village has an obligation to repurchase a unit, residents have an absolute right to be paid the purchase price on termination of occupation. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that a retirement village supplies a 56. financial service (the allotment of a debt security) under any transaction where the retirement village accepts an obligation to repurchase a unit from a resident (not being simply an option to repurchase) or to repay a loan or deposit. Consideration for debt security The value of a supply is the consideration for the supply: s 10(2). The definition 57. of “consideration” in s 2(1) refers to “any payment ... in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of a supply”. The term “consideration” is defined widely and extends beyond the ordinary meaning of the term and its meaning under general contract law: Trustee, Executors and Agency Co New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,076 (HC); Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 (CA) at 10,036; CIR v NZ Refining Co Ltd (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA) at 13,191; and Case M40 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,247. For the payments to be consideration for a supply, there must be a sufficient relationship between the payments and a supply: NZ Refining Co; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075 (CA); Suzuki NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 (CA); and Trustee Executors. The consideration for a supply may comprise a number of payments. In the Trustee Executors case, a lease of land provided that, in addition to rent, the tenant was required to pay the rates on the land. Chisholm J considered that the payment of rates by the tenant was part of the “consideration” for the supply of the land. If a payment is consideration under contract law, the necessary element of 58. reciprocity in the relationship between payer and payee will be present and there wi ll be a sufficient relationship between the payment made by the payer and a supply by the payee. Consideration under contract law has been defined as “the 14 price for which the promise of the other is bought”: Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd \[1915\] AC 847 (HL). Therefore, if a payment is consideration for contract law purposes, the payment is consideration for GST purposes. The Culverden case supports the view that under contract law an entry payment 59. is consideration for a debt security (being the price paid for the promise by the retirement village to repay a loan or deposit to residents). In that case, the entry payment was in the form of the purchase price for a unit in the retirement village. In the High Court ((1995) 7 NZCLC 260,850), Morris J considered that the consideration for a debt security (the right to be paid money under the buy-back arrangement) was either the purchaser entering into the restrictive covenant or the original purchase price for the unit, or both. The Court of Appeal ((1996) 1 BCSLR 162) considered that the purchase price paid by residents was consideration for the unit and for other rights conferred on residents under their contracts (including the right to be paid money under the buy-back arrangement). That view is consistent with the judgment of the Privy Council, which considered that a purchaser acquired two rights for the entry payment (the right to occupy a unit and the right, on termination of occupation, to be repaid the purchase price, subject to adjustment). However, the Commissioner accepts that payments received in respect of the 60. supply of financial services do not reflect the true value of the financial services supplied and, for that reason, the principal under a debt security is not to be treated as the consideration for the supply of a debt security. Therefore, in the context of retirement villages this means that the entry payment (being either the purchase price paid by the resident for a unit, the loan or deposit paid) is not consideration for a debt security. Debt security is a separate supply It could be argued that a retirement village operator supplies a single supply of a 61. debt security and that the right to accommodation is a right that attaches to that supply. Such an argument would be similar to the finding in Gulf Harbour that what was supplied in that case was an equity security and the right to membership of the golf club attached to that share. However, for the reasons set out below, the Commissioner considers that the Gulf Harbour case is distinguishable from the current situation on this aspect. The Commissioner accepts that the Gulf Harbour case establishes that under the 62. New Zealand legislation the focus is on what in legal terms is supplied and whether the supply satisfies the statutory definition of “financial services”. The Gulf Harbour case involved a sale of shares, which is a bundle of rights and is a single item of property: Re Alex Russell (1968) VR 285 (SC). The supply of a share carries with it all the rights that make up the share and results in the shareholder becoming entitled to those rights, but the subject of the supply is the share rather than the rights that make up ownership of the share. The rights attached to the share do not determine the nature of the supply made. Therefore, the transfer of a share involved a single supply, which was a financial service (being the transfer of an equity security). The amendments made following Gulf Harbour override the Marac principle in so 63. far as transactions involving equity securities and participatory securities are concerned. However, the amendments do not apply to debt securities. Therefore, the analysis in Gulf Harbour remains applicable to debt securities. The subject of the supply of a debt security is a debt security. Ownership of a 64. debt security confers only one right on the recipient, the right to be paid money. The rights to accommodation and other services are not rights that make up 15 ownership of a debt security. The supply of a debt security does not result in the recipient having the right to accommodation and other services. In Gulf Harbour, there was only one element in the transaction (the supply of the share, ownership of which conferred the right to membership of the golf club) that fell within the definition of “financial services”. Therefore, on this aspect, the Gulf Harbour case is distinguishable. In the Culverden case, the Privy Council held that a debt security was issued 65. where an agreement for the sale and purchase of a unit in a retirement village required the retirement village to repurchase the unit. The Privy Council did not accept that the debt security was ancillary to the sale of the unit and considered that the purchaser acquired two rights: the right to occupy the unit and the right to be repaid the price paid for the unit (adjusted upwards or downwards according to the length of occupation, the condition of the unit and the movement of the market). In the context of considering whether the transaction involved an “investment of money”, the Privy Council considered that the return received by purchasers for the original purchase price was in the form of the use of the unit (together with necessary services) and in the form of the repayment of all or most of the initial payment. In other words, the true and substantial nature of the consideration provided for the original purchase price (the essential feature of the transaction) was both the right to occupy the unit (and associated services) and the right to payment of the repurchase price (the debt security). Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the supply of a debt security is a separate supply from the supply of accommodation. Supply of accommodation For GST purposes, sometimes the supply of accommodation made when a 66. retirement unit is leased or licenced to a resident will be an exempt supply. For this reason it is important to understand the nature of the accommodation being supplied by a retirement village when a retirement unit is leased or licenced to a resident and whether the payments typically made by residents of retirement villages are consideration for the supply of accommodation. Accordingly, the Interpretation Statement now addresses: 67.  The scope of the term “accommodation”, in particular: - the meaning of “accommodation”; - whether the right to use common areas and facilities forms part of the supply of accommodation; - whether the types of services provided in return for the payment of periodic fees form part of the supply of accommodation; and - whether care services provided to residents form part of the supply of accommodation;  Whether the amounts typically paid by residents are consideration for the supply of accommodation, in particular: - entry payments; - “facilities fees” or “amenities contributions”; - periodic fees; and - refurbishment costs and other termination charges. 16 Scope of term “accommodation” Understanding the scope of the term “accommodation” in the context of 68. retirement villages is important, as sometimes (as indicated above at \[66\]) the supply of accommodation is an exempt supply. Meaning of “accommodation” The supply of accommodation, in the sense of a place to live, is central to the 69. concept of retirement villages and is an essential feature of the transaction between retirement villages and their residents. “Accommodation” is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12th ed, 70. Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) as meaning: a room, building or space in which someone may live or stay. “Accommodation” means lodgings, living premises, a place to live, somewhere 71. where someone resides: Byrne v Glasgow Corporation \[1955\] SLT 9; Butter v Bennett \[1963\] Ch 185 (CA); Puhlhofer v Hillingdon London BC \[1986\] AC 484 (HL); Owen v Elliott (1990) STC 469 (CA); Urdd Gobaith Cymru v C & E Commrs \[1997\] V & DR 273. Right to use common areas and facilities is part of a supply of accommodation For the reasons outlined at \[124\]–\[136\], the Commissioner considers that the 72. right to use the common areas and facilities is part of the dwelling in a retirement village (being an appurtenance belonging to or used with the dwellings: para (b)(ii) of the definition of “dwelling”). However, if that conclusion is incorrect, the Commissioner still considers that the 73. right to use common areas and facilities forms part of the supply of accommodation. Without access to the common areas, it would not be possible to exercise the right to occupy the dwellings. The availability of the recreational facilities in a retirement village may make a 74. retirement village more attractive to prospective residents. However, the motives of the recipient and the way in which a retirement village is marketed are not relevant in determining the nature of a supply: see Gulf Harbour. It is also irrelevant that a retirement village may supply the right to use a community centre to non-residents (that is, separately from the supply of accommodation). In Gulf Harbour, the Court of Appeal held that the fact that in some cases membership of the golf club was supplied separately from the supply of shares did not mean that in all cases two separate supplies were made. Hidden Valley Golf Resort Association v R \[2000\] GTC 4104 (FCA) concerned a 75. lease under which the tenants were granted an exclusive right to a lot on which a vacation cottage could be built along with the right to use a golf course, club house, artificial lake and tennis court on the lessor’s property. It was held in that case that the essence of the transaction was a long-term residential lease and that the taxpayer had not made a separate supply of the right to use the recreational facilities and the right to compel the lessor to provide certain services. An analogy can be drawn with the transaction considered in British Airways, where the issue was whether in-flight catering was a separate supply from the supply of air transport. It was held that the supply made by British Airways was the supply of air transport of a particular standard and that the supply of food and beverages was an incidental part of the supply of air transport. The right to use the facilities in a community centre is ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation in the sense that the right contributes to the supply of accommodation of a particular quality. 17 Periodic fees to cover operating costs and upkeep Periodic fees payable when a retirement unit is leased or licenced are calculated 76. by reference to the costs incurred in operating a retirement village, including the administration costs (such as rates, insurance, maintenance, depreciation, salaries and statutory costs) and the costs of providing security, cleaning, gardening for common areas and facilities. Generally the periodic fees include the cost of providing the emergency call response service. The periodic fees may also include an amount to cover the cost of transport services. Alternatively, a separate charge may be made for transport services on each occasion such services are supplied. However, the way in which a payment is calculated does not determine the nature of the supply made for the payment: Motorcorp. The maintenance of the unit and of village facilities is part of the supply of 77. accommodation when the retirement unit is leased or licenced, being services that make possible the supply of accommodation by keeping the unit and the village facilities in good repair. Supply of care services Care services are medical and nursing services and assistance with daily living 78. and include the services provided as part of a care package. These services are described at \[ 41\]. The Commissioner considers that the supply of care services as part of a care 79. package is not part of the supply of accommodation. Care services do not facilitate, enable or contribute to the supply of accommodation and are not an ancillary or incidental feature of the transaction. The care services provided under a care package include an emergency response 80. service. An emergency response service is also typically supplied to residents who do not purchase a care package. The Commissioner considers that where an emergency response service is the only care service provided, that service is an ancillary or incidental feature of the transaction and is not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration supplied for the payments made by residents. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that such an emergency response service is part of the supply of accommodation. This view is supported by Wairakei Court Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,202 (HC) 81. where it was held that:  the consideration payable by residents of the studio units whose contracts provided for the supply of either full care or partial care was paid for the supply of both care and accommodation; and  the supply of the care component to residents of the villas (which could only be the emergency response service) was at best ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner also considers that: 82.  The provision of transport services as part of a package of services is an ancillary or incidental feature of the supply of accommodation and the supply of transport services does not alter the nature of the supply made.  Any additional optional care or other services supplied at the request of the resident for an additional charge are separate supplies made under separate transactions. 18 Summary of scope of “accommodation” Therefore, the Commissioner considers that when a retirement unit is leased or 83. licenced:  The supply of accommodation is an essential feature of a retirement village contract.  The supply of maintenance services is part of the supply of accommodation, being services that contribute to the supply of accommodation by keeping the unit and the village facilities in good repair.  The right to use the common areas and facilities is also part of the supply of accommodation. It would not be possible to use the units without access through the common areas. The right to use the facilities in a community centre is ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation in the sense that the right contributes to the supply of accommodation of a particular quality.  Care services supplied as part of a care package are not part of the supply of accommodation. Care services do not facilitate, enable or contribute to the supply of accommodation and are not an ancillary or incidental feature of the transaction. Where an emergency call response service is the only care service supplied, that service is an ancillary or incidental benefit that does not alter the character of the supply of accommodation.  Transport services supplied as part of a package of services are also ancillary or incidental benefits to the supply of accommodation. As a result, transport services supplied as part of a package of services do not constitute a supply separate from the supply of accommodation.  Any additional optional care or other services supplied at the request of residents for an additional payment are separate supplies made under separate transactions. Payments which are consideration for the supply of accommodation Of the payments typically made to retirement villages by residents who lease or 84. licence their retirement units, the Commissioner considers that the consideration for the supply of accommodation includes:  the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”;  the periodic fees; and  the refurbishment costs and other termination charges. There is a clear relationship between the “facilities fee” or “amenities 85. contribution”, the periodic fees and the refurbishment and termination charges and the supply of accommodation. These charges are “in respect of, in response to or for the inducement of” the supply of accommodation. However, before going on to discuss these charges in more detail, the Interpretation Statement will discuss whether entry payments are consideration for the supply of accommodation. Entry payments In most cases an entry payment is not consideration for the supply of a debt 86. security. This is because the entry payment is effectively just a supply of money. As indicated previously (at \[61\]–\[65\]) the Commissioner also considers that the use of the entry payment by the retirement village operator over the period of occupation is generally not consideration for the supply of accommodation. 19 The definition of “consideration” refers to a payment, act or forbearance. The 87. Commissioner considers the provision of money lent (irrespective of terms) is an “act”, being something that is done. The Commissioner also considers that the fact that the giving of a loan is not consideration for issuing a debt security does not prevent it being capable of being consideration for some other supply. Where the money lent is provided on, for example, low or interest-free terms, a borrower may enjoy the benefit of the money at a reduced cost during the period of the loan. Accordingly, it is not unreasonable to expect the parties to enter into a bargain whereby the borrower supplies goods and services as the quid pro quo for the provision of the money on such terms. Where a service is being provided in relation to the provision of a loan, that 88. supply must be valued. Section 10(2) provides in this situation that the value of the supply is the open market value of the consideration. Section 4 sets out the rules for determining the “open market value” of any supply. In Newman v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,666 (HC), Smellie J stated at 15,688: The definition of “open market value” in s 4 appears to me to cover every contingency. Thus “similar supply” is addressed in subs (1) while subs (2) ties the value to “the consideration in money which the supply of those goods would generally fetch” on the open market between persons who are not associated persons. Sub-section (3) covers the situation where the value cannot be determined pursuant to subs (2). And where neither subss (2) nor (3) are capable of providing an answer, subs (4) allows the Commissioner to adopt a method “which provides a sufficiently objective approximation”. Then subs (5) provides a means whereby the value of consideration other than money can be ascertained. In short, there is virtually no room for technical arguments seeking to place a case outside the definition. In all circumstances where this matter arises, the Commissioner considers it is 89. important to take care in identifying the true nature of the transaction. For example, under the law of contract, a loan does not automatically bear interest. In other words, the lender is not entitled to interest unless there is an agreement that the borrower will pay interest. Accordingly, the law of contract confirms that where a loan is made at no interest, then, without more, no inference can be made as to the GST treatment on the basis of some perceived provision of a concessional use of money. To establish a different transactional form involving, for example, the supply of “non-monetary consideration” would require an agreement on those terms—an agreement clearly showing the real or true intention of the parties. The essence of the approach is to discover the legal rights and duties that are actually created by the transaction into which the parties entered. From a practical perspective, it is fundamental that the focus remain on the legal arrangements actually entered into and not on the economic or other consequences of the arrangements. The Commissioner considers that a retirement village entry payment does not 90. provide any rights to occupy the relevant accommodation unless the legal arrangements establish that the entry payment, or any part of it, is consideration for the supply of accommodation. “Facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” The facilities fee is either: 91.  an upfront payment that the retirement village is entitled to take immediately or that accrues to the retirement village over a specified period; or  a payment that becomes due on termination and that is deducted from the loan or deposit refundable to the resident. A payment may be made by way of set off: Re Harmony & Montague Tin & Copper Mining Co Ltd (Spargo’s Case) (1873) 8 Ch App 407 (CA). The principle in Spargo’s case applies where there are mutual liabilities and an agreement that these liabilities will 20 be set off: FCT v Steeves Agnew & Co (Victoria) Pty Ltd (1951) 9 ATD 259, 82 CLR 408 (HCA); Lend Lease Corporation Ltd v FCT 90 ATC 4401 (FCA). The Commissioner considers that the obligation of a resident to pay the facilities fee is a separate obligation from the obligation of the retirement village to make payment under a debt security; therefore, there are mutual debts between a retirement village and the resident. It is also usually agreed between the parties that the facilities fee is to be deducted from the amount repayable to the resident. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” payable on termination is paid when the obligation of residents to pay the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is set off against the obligation of the retirement village to repay the loan or deposit. Under s 9(3)(a), if goods are supplied under an agreement for hire, or services 92. are supplied under any agreement that provides for periodic payments, the time of supply for the goods or services is the earlier of the time when a payment becomes due or is received. Leases or licences of units provide for periodic payments (periodic fees). The “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution” is also consideration for the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner considers that in terms of s 9(3)(a): 93.  Where an agreement requires the payment of an up-front facilities fee, a supply is made when the facilities fee becomes payable (generally at the same time as the loan or deposit). If the incorrect amount of output tax on the facilities fee has been paid as a result of early termination, s 25 will apply. Section 25 applies if the previously agreed consideration for a supply has been altered: s 25(1)(b). Section 25(2) will allow the retirement village to make an adjustment in the period during which it has become apparent that the output tax is incorrect.  Where the facilities fee is payable on termination, a supply is made when the facilities fee is set off against the loan or deposit repaid to the resident. On that date (the repayment date), the facilities fee becomes due for payment and payment is received by the retirement village by way of set off. Periodic fees Generally residents who purchase a package of care services are required to pay 94. a higher amount (than other residents) in terms of periodic fees. In such circumstances, the periodic fees are attributable to both the supply of accommodation and the supply of care services. In these cases it is necessary to determine what proportion of the periodic fees attributable to the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling is consideration for “domestic goods and services” for the purpose of s 10(6). Under s 10(6), the value attributed to the supply of “domestic goods and 95. services” in a commercial dwelling is reduced. “Domestic goods and services” are defined in s 2 as: domestic goods and services means the right to occupy the whole or part of any commercial dwelling, including, where it is provided as part of the right to so occupy, the supply of— (a) cleaning and maintenance: (b) electricity, gas, air-conditioning, or heating: (c) telephone, television, radio, or any other similar chattel 21 Refurbishment costs and other termination charges The Commissioner accepts that if residents have an obligation to refurbish their 96. units on termination of occupation and that obligation is carried out by the retirement village, the refurbishment costs will be consideration for the carrying out of refurbishment work. In both Suzuki NZ and Motorcorp, an overseas manufacturer had an obligation under the warranty given to the New Zealand importer to repair defective vehicles. The repairs were carried out by the New Zealand importer or its agents at the cost of the overseas manufacturer. The Court of Appeal considered that the reimbursement payment was consideration for the supply of repair services by the New Zealand importer. However, the Commissioner understands that generally residents have an obligation to pay for the costs incurred by the retirement village in refurbishing their units, rather than an obligation to carry out the refurbishment of their units. Residents who lease or licence their units are not a party to any contract for the 97. lease or licence of their units to a new resident. In marketing a unit and obtaining a replacement resident, retirement villages are acting for their own benefit. Whether a lessee has an obligation to pay the lessor’s legal costs in connection 98. with the preparation of a lease depends on the agreement between them. A lessor cannot recover such costs unless the lessee is liable for them: Metcalfe v Venables \[1921\] NZLR 576 (SC). Therefore, legal costs in relation to the preparation of a lease or licence (or the termination of a lease or licence) are costs for which the retirement village is primarily liable. A payment to a third party could be consideration. The crucial factor in determining whether a payment is consideration is whether there is a sufficient connection between the payment and the supply: Trustee Executors case. Whether the facilities fee, the periodic fees and the refurbishment and other 99. termination charges are subject to GST depends on whether they relate to the supply of accommodation in a dwelling or a commercial dwelling. If the charges are paid for the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling (a taxable supply), they are subject to GST. This issue is considered at \[106\]–\[141\]. GST supplies made by retirement villages that are exempt supplies Section 14 provides that certain supplies are exempt supplies for GST purposes. 100. In the case of retirement villages, given the nature of the supplies made by villages, the supplies that are most likely to be exempt supplies for GST purposes are:  the supply of financial services (issue or allotment of a debt security): s 14(1)(a); and  the supply of accommodation by way of hire, service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy in a dwelling: s 14(1)(c). Section 14(1)(a) – issue or allotment of a debt security The supply of financial services is an exempt supply under s 14(1)(a). The 101. definition of “financial services” includes the issue or allotment of a debt security: s 3(1)(c). If one of the activities in s 3(1)(c) is carried out by a taxpayer, a service (being a financial service) will be supplied by the taxpayer. This is supported by Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 and Gulf Harbour. In those cases the court held that the transfer of a security was a financial service. For the reasons outlined at \[ 47\]–\[65\], the Commissioner considers that a retirement village makes an allotment of a debt security under any transaction where a 22 retirement village accepts an obligation to repurchase a unit or to repay a loan or deposit. Section 14(1)(a) also applies to services that are reasonably incidental and 102. necessary to the supply of financial services. The Commissioner does not accept that the supply of accommodation or other services is reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of financial services. The reasons are as follows:  “Incidental” means something that is incidental to or is usually associated with another activity or that occurs or is liable to occur in fortuitous or subordinate conjunction with another activity: Canadian National Railway v Harris \[1946\] 2 DLR 545 (SCC); C & E Commrs v C H Beazer (Holdings) plc (1989) 4 BVC 121 (QB). The core activities of a retirement village are the supply of accommodation and care services. Debt securities are supplied to provide funding for the development of a retirement village where accommodation and other services are supplied. Accommodation and care are not generally supplied by financial institutions who supply debt securities. The supply of accommodation and care is not usually associated with, and does not arise out of, the supply of a debt security and is not liable to occur in conjunction with the supply of a debt security.  “Necessary” means indispensable, expedient or really needed: Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (5 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2002); Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 \[1988\] 1 All ER 203 (HL). The supply of accommodation and care services is not indispensable, useful, expedient or really needed for the supply of a debt security. Given this, s 14(1)(a) does not apply to the supply of accommodation and other 103. services by a retirement village. Such services are not reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of a debt security and therefore cannot be exempt supplies on that basis. Section 14(1)(c) – supply of accommodation in a dwelling Section 14(1)(c) only applies to the supply of accommodation by way of hire, 104. service occupancy agreement or licence to occupy. Therefore s 14(1)(c) cannot apply to exempt the supply when a unit in a retirement village is sold to a resident. The sale of a unit in a retirement village is a taxable supply (if it is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity). Section 14(1)(c) potentially applies to the lease or licence of a unit in a 105. retirement village, as a lease or licence is a supply by way of hire or licence to occupy. However, for s 14(1)(c) to apply, the supply must be the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”. Meaning of “dwelling” For retirement villages that lease or license units to residents, it is important to 106. understand the scope of the term “dwelling”. This is because any supply of accommodation made by a retirement village to a resident in a “dwelling” is an exempt supply for GST purposes. The term “dwelling” is defined in s 2(1). It includes any appurtenances used along with the occupied premises but specifically excludes a “commercial dwelling”. Section 2(1) defines “dwelling” as follows: 107. dwelling, for a person,— (a) means premises, as defined in section 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986,— (i) that the person occupies, or that it can reasonably be foreseen that the person will occupy, as their principal place of residence; and 23 (ii) in relation to which the person has quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; and (b) includes— (i) accommodation provided to a person who is occupying the same premises, or part of the same premises, as the supplier of the accommodation and who meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(i): (ii) any appurtenances belonging to or used with the premises: (iii) despite paragraph (a)(ii), a residential unit in a retirement village or rest home when the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the unit is for the right to occupy the unit; and (c) excludes a commercial dwelling: Section 2(1) defines “commercial dwelling” as follows: 108. commercial dwelling— (a) means— (i) a hotel, motel, homestay, farmstay, bed and breakfast establishment, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse: (ii) a serviced apartment managed or operated by a third party for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986: (iii) a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice: (iv) a camping ground: (v) premises of a similar kind to those referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iv); and (b) excludes— (i) a hospital except to the extent to which the hospital is a residential establishment: (ii) a dwelling referred to in paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of dwelling: Paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” specifically includes “a residential 109. unit in a retirement village or rest home when the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the unit is for the right to occupy the unit”. Paragraph (c) of the definition of “dwelling” excludes a “commercial dwelling”. Paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” provides that a dwelling that is referred to in para (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” is excluded from the definition of “commercial dwelling”. The Commissioner considers, therefore, that a unit in a retirement village is a “dwelling” if it satisfies para (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling”. Consideration is for right to occupy To determine if para (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” applies to a supply of 110. accommodation, it is necessary to decide whether the consideration paid or payable by the resident is for the right to occupy the unit. As noted above at \[57\]:  The term “consideration” is defined widely in s 2(1) and extends beyond the ordinary meaning of the term and its meaning under general contract law.  The term “consideration” requires a sufficient nexus between the payment and the supply. As a result, an amount will be consideration for the supply of accommodation when it has a sufficient nexus with the supply. The ordinary meaning of para (b)(iii) suggests that the consideration must be 111. solely for the right to occupy the unit. This is because of the use of the words “is 24 for the right to occupy the unit” and the absence of any qualifying words (such as “in whole or in part”). In determining the meaning of para (b)(iii), it is also relevant to examine the context and purpose of the relevant provisions to see what Parliament intended: s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 and Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36. The commentary to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2013 (176-1) (which enacted para (b)(iii)) suggests the policy intent was to maintain the pre-April 2011 GST treatment of retirement village accommodation. The pre-April 2011 GST treatment of retirement village accommodation under 112. para (f) of the previous definition of “commercial dwelling” was discussed in Wairakei. Paragraph (b)(iii) of the current definition of “dwelling” is very similar to the previous para (f) of the old definition of “commercial dwelling”. Wairakei involved a rest home operator who had expanded its village by 113. constructing studio units and villas. The operator claimed a full input tax deduction for the costs of the studio units and the villas on the basis they were commercial dwellings. The High Court held that the studio units were commercial dwellings, but the villas were dwellings because they fell within the exception in para (f). Chisholm J discussed the distinction between the studio units (commercial dwellings) and the villas (dwellings) in the circumstances (at 15,204): The studio units, which could be described as "bed sits", are expanded versions of the original rest home bedrooms. The objector believed that these studio units would appeal to elderly people seeking more space and a higher degree of independence than was offered by the rest home bedrooms. Occupants of the studio units are contractually bound to receive and pay for either full care, which equates with the care received by the occupants of the rest home bedrooms, or partial care, which is available to those residents who enjoy greater independence and require slightly less individual care. Partial care includes the provision of all meals, morning and afternoon tea, electricity, clean towels daily, clean linen weekly, cleaning of the unit weekly, laundering of linen and personal clothes, all activities and outings as arranged, as well as constant monitoring of the resident's health needs by registered nursing staff. The occupier of a studio unit pays a weekly rest home care fee for his or her full or partial care. ... While a nurse call button is located in each room of a villa and villa residents are entitled to utilise community facilities and rest home services available to other residents, they are not under any obligation to do so. Their gardens and lawns are kept and outside windows cleaned, but the resident is responsible for the interior of the villa unless assistance is sought. The level of care and assistance to be provided by the objector is determined by the occupier of the villa. Although licences to occupy villas are similar to licences to occupy studio units, there are two principal differences. First, the licence fee and occupation loan for villas are higher. Secondly, there is no requirement for villa residents to pay a weekly rest home care fee. Instead they pay a weekly service fee to cover such items as community security, rates, insurance, the provision of a nurse emergency call service and the use of communal facilities. The weekly service fee is, of course, considerably less than the weekly rest home care fee. Extra services for such things as nursing, meals and assistance within the villa are paid for by the occupier on top of the weekly service fee. \[Emphasis added\] Chisholm J went on to conclude that the differences meant that para (f) did not 114. apply to the studio units (at 15,208): ...the exclusion in paragraph (f) does not apply because the studio unit licences to occupy require the occupier to "pay to the \[objector\] a weekly Rest Home fee in respect of the Unit". As explained earlier, the weekly rest home fees are for full or partial care. Either way those fees represent a substantial payment which could not by any stretch of the imagination be construed as part of the consideration for the right to occupy the studio units in terms of paragraph (f). The consideration relating to the care component is not only distinct from the accommodation component, it is also substantial. In substance the situation is no different 25 from the rest home proper where there is both a care component and an accommodation component. On the other hand, Chisholm J held (at 15,208–15,209) that para (f) did apply to 115. the villas because: \[The villas\] are effectively stand alone cottages within the rest home complex. Their occupants pay a weekly service fee to cover such items as community security, rates, insurance, an emergency call service and use of community facilities. On the other hand, unlike the studio units, there is no requirement for the occupants of villas to take care. Indeed, the villa occupiers are perfectly entitled to occupy their villas without purchasing any care at all. \[Emphasis added\] Residents of the studio units were required under their licence to pay a weekly 116. rest home fee for full or partial care, in addition to the licence fee and occupation loan. The court did not distinguish between the two levels of care provided to residents of the studio units. The essential difference between the studio units and the villas was that in order to be entitled to occupy the studio units, residents were required to also pay for (and were entitled to receive) care services. Residents of the villas were not required to receive and pay for care services in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. The consideration that villa residents were required to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation related solely to the supply of accommodation. The Commissioner considers that to decide whether para (b)(iii) of the definition 117. of “dwelling” applies, it is necessary to identify the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. The consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation will normally include the entry payment, the “facilities fee” or “amenities contribution”, the periodic fees and exit payments. Optional payments that residents make if they require additional services are not part of the consideration that residents are contractually required to pay in order to be entitled to the supply of accommodation. This does not mean that the total amount of the consideration that will be payable 118. by residents over the period of their occupation must be determined. It requires consideration of the terms of the agreement under which residents obtain a right to occupy a unit in a retirement village (generally a lease or a licence) to determine whether such consideration is for the right to occupy the dwelling (that is, for the supply of accommodation). Where residents have a right to occupy a dwelling in a retirement village, there is a corresponding obligation on the part of the retirement village to supply accommodation. Paragraph (b)(iii) applies to a unit in a retirement village if the consideration that 119. residents are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to the supply of accommodation is for the supply of accommodation (including appurtenances to a dwelling and including goods or services that are ancillary or incidental to the supply of accommodation). Paragraph (b)(iii) does not apply where the consideration that residents are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to accommodation relates to the supply of services other than accommodation. Where residents are required to purchase a care package, the consideration that they are contractually obliged to pay to be entitled to accommodation is for the supply of accommodation and care services. The fact that a contractual obligation to pay for care services is suspended during any period of temporary absence when care services are not provided does not mean that the consideration that residents are obliged to pay to be entitled to occupy a unit does not include consideration for care services. 26 This view is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the legislation. The 120. purpose of para (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” is to determine whether a unit in a retirement village is to be classified as a dwelling for the purpose of s 14(1)(c) (which provides for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling to be an exempt supply). The legislation contemplates that both taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation (including the right to use the common areas and facilities) will be made in a retirement village. The policy underlying para (b)(iii) is that the supply of accommodation in a retirement village is intended to be exempt from GST where the contract under which accommodation is provided is for the supply of no more than accommodation. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that para (b)(iii) will not apply to units 121. whose residents are required to purchase care packages. In the Commissioner’s view, such units form part of a commercial dwelling so that the supply of accommodation in such units is a taxable supply. On the basis of contractual arrangements that are typically entered into between 122. retirement villages and their residents, para (b)(iii) will apply to units whose residents are not required to purchase care packages and where the consideration paid by the residents is for the right to occupy the dwelling. Such units are dwellings and therefore, the supply of accommodation in such units is an exempt supply. Paragraph (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” applies to a dwelling within a 123. retirement village or rest home if the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the dwelling is for the right to occupy the dwelling. The distinction between rest homes and retirement villages may be blurred, both being places where care and accommodation are provided for senior citizens. The inclusion of “rest home” in para (b)(iii) means that it is unnecessary to decide where the boundary between rest homes and retirement villages should be drawn. Appurtenances The definition of “dwelling” in s 2(1) includes in para (b)(ii) “any appurtenances 124. belonging to or used with the premises”. Therefore, to understand the scope of the term “dwelling” it is also necessary to understand what appurtenances are and what might be included in the context of a retirement village. Ordinary meaning The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles defines 125. “appurtenance” as follows: 1 A minor property, right, or privilege, subsidiary or incidental to a more important one; an appendage. 2 A contributory adjunct, an accessory. 3 The fact or state of appertaining. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition indicates that an appurtenance is 126. a “minor property, right, or privilege” that is subsidiary or incidental to a more important one. Meaning of “appurtenances” The meaning of “appurtenances” in the context of the GSTA was considered in 127. Norfolk and Wairakei. Norfolk concerned a retirement village consisting of a four-storey building 128. containing 22 apartments with garages underneath. The building took up one- third of the land area and was surrounded by gardens and landscaped grounds, 27 paths and driveways. Access to the apartments was through common areas (corridors, stairwells, driveways, parking areas and the like). Other common areas included community and reception lounges, a library, an activities room, a consulting room, visitors’ car parking spaces, and the gardens and the grounds. Residents were granted occupation licences of the apartments and garages for terms of 99 years. The rights granted under the licence included a right to the use and enjoyment of common areas. The Court of Appeal in Norfolk considered that shared rights could be 129. appurtenances and, given that the definition of “dwelling” refers to appurtenances “belonging thereto and enjoyed with” the building or premises, Parliament must have intended appurtenances to include a non-exclusive right to use areas and facilities situated outside the four walls of the apartment and garage for which residents had exclusive use. The Court of Appeal said (at 12,215): In our view the common areas and the facilities upon them, the use and enjoyment of which is promised to the residents of the dwellings in the occupation licences, are appurtenances to the dwellings. On the subject of ‘appurtenances’ Mr Martin referred us to Trim v Sturminster Urban District Council \[1938\] 2 All ER 168 in which it was held that the word ‘appurtenances’ in the definition of ‘house’ in a statute had to be given its natural meaning and could not be extended to cover land outside the curtilage of the house. In that case the land consisted of a house with 10 acres of grassland and cow-stalls capable of accommodating 10 or 12 cows. It is unsurprising that the part of the land which was being farmed was not regarded as an appurtenance. But significantly the Court observed that in the early case of Bryan v Wetherhead (1625) Cro Car 17 ‘appurtenances’ of a house had been held to include its orchard, yard, curtilage and gardens. In another authority referred to by Mr Martin, Methuen-Campbell v Walters \[1979\] 1 All ER 606, it was held that whether land fell within the curtilage of other land was a question of fact and that a paddock physically separated from a house was not within the curtilage of the house and was therefore not an appurtenance for the purposes of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. That case is also clearly distinguishable. In the present case the whole of the land in question is laid out in driveway, paths, gardens and landscaped grounds for the use and enjoyment of occupants of residences in the building and all of it is accordingly integral to and within the curtilage of the building. Mr Martin also argued that the rights of the residents relating to the common areas were not ‘accommodation in any dwelling by way of ... a licence to occupy’ because those rights were not in themselves accommodation and because a ‘licence to occupy’ means a ‘right to exclusive personal occupancy’ and therefore cannot extend to shared areas and facilities. However, we think that rights and services going with accommodation are properly to be regarded as part of the accommodation provided to residents and that the element of exclusivity and occupation need not extend to those rights and services. Rights appurtenant to a title to land are very often shared with others. When it included within the term ‘dwelling’ the appurtenances ‘belonging thereto and enjoyed with’ the building or premises we do not think that the Legislature would have had in mind only those amenities which were exclusively contained within the walls of a dwelling or garage.” \[Emphasis added\] Norfolk is consistent with Cadogan v McGirk \[1996\] 4 All ER 643 (CA), which 130. confirms that appurtenances may include land within the building in which the apartments are situated or within the curtilage of the building in which the apartments are situated. However, Wairakei, which concerned detached buildings that had their own curtilage, cannot be explained on that basis. Wairakei concerned a retirement village that consisted of a rest home complex with 37 beds, six villas (stand-alone units) and 17 studio units that were contained in one building. Occupants of the villas were entitled to use community facilities. Chisholm J considered that (on the basis of the authority of Norfolk) the common areas and facilities were appurtenances to the villas. Chisholm J did not consider whether the common areas and facilities were within the curtilage of the villas. 28 Both Wairakei and Norfolk concerned non-exclusive rights to use land. The 131. Commissioner considers that the basis for the decisions in Norfolk and Wairakei is that the right to use the common areas and facilities was an appurtenance, rather than the land or building comprising the common areas and facilities being an appurtenance. Areas within a community centre to which residents do not have access are not within the meaning of “common areas and facilities” (eg, the kitchen and the food storage areas). Belonging to or used with the premises As noted above at \[124\], only those appurtenances belonging to or used with the 132. premises are part of the dwelling. In some contexts, the phrase “belonging to” indicates ownership: Myerson v 133. Collard (1918) 25 CLR 154 (HCA). However, the words “belonging to” in the context of the definition of “dwelling” relate to “premises”, which cannot own or possess something. The Commissioner considers:  Whether a building belongs to a principal building depends on whether the use of the building is associated with and is part of the use of the principal building.  A degree of physical separation between two buildings does not mean that one does not belong to the other. An ancillary building belongs to the principal building if the two buildings are on the same site, are adjacent to (next or adjoining: Concise Oxford English Dictionary) each other or sufficiently close to each other so that the use or occupation of the ancillary building is for all practical purposes part of the use or occupation of the principal building. To belong to the principal building, the ancillary building need not be contiguous with (neighbouring or connected with) the principal building. See English Clays Lovering Pochin & Co Ltd v Plymouth Corporation \[1974\] 2 All ER 239 (CA); Re Red Lion Inn Ltd \[1979\] 2 NZLR 668 (SC) and Re Angus Hotels Ltd (1986) 6 NZAR 148. An appurtenance belongs to, or is used with, a dwelling if the use of an 134. appurtenance is part of the use and occupation of a dwelling and the resident of the dwelling has the right to use the appurtenance together with the dwelling. The Commissioner accepts that there must be a reasonable degree of proximity between the dwellings in a retirement village and a community centre before the right to use the community centre could be said to be associated with, and part of, the use of the dwellings. However, it is unlikely that a community centre would be so geographically distant from the dwellings that the use of the community centre could not, in practical terms, be associated with and used with the dwellings. The Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas and facilities in a retirement village is an appurtenance that belongs to the dwellings in a retirement village, being a right that is connected with and that is part of the use of the dwellings in the retirement village as a place to live. Residential rentals were exempted from GST because of the practical difficulty of 135. collecting GST on residential rentals and to place owner–occupiers and tenants on the same footing: White Paper on Goods and Services Tax: Proposals for the administration of the goods and services tax (New Zealand Government, March 1985). The extension of the definition of “dwelling” to include appurtenances belonging to, or used with, a dwelling means that the entire amount of the consideration paid for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling, including rights going with the supply of the accommodation, is exempt. 29 Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the right to use the common areas 136. and facilities for access or for recreation purposes is an appurtenance of dwellings in a retirement village, including dwellings occupied under a lease or a licence. This means the supply of the right to use the common areas and facilities for access or for recreation purposes in a retirement village will be an exempt supply where it forms part of the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. “Commercial dwelling” excluded from “dwelling” As noted above at \[109\], the definition of “dwelling” specifically excludes a 137. “commercial dwelling”. The definition of “commercial dwelling” includes convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes and hospices, and establishments of a similar kind: paras (a)(iii) and (v) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” in s 2(1). Further, the definition of “commercial dwelling” also includes a serviced apartment managed or operated by a third party for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment: para (a)(ii). Therefore, all these types of dwelling are excluded from the definition of “dwelling”. However, a dwelling situated within a retirement village is not a commercial dwelling if the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy the dwelling: para (b)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” in s 2. Convalescent home, nursing home, rest home or hospice A rest home is a residential institution where old or frail people are cared for: 138. Concise Oxford English Dictionary. In Wairakei, it was considered that the studio units situated in a retirement village fell within para (c) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”. The court considered that in substance the studio units were no different from the rest home in the retirement village as both accommodation and care were provided there. To be similar to a convalescent home, nursing home, rest home or hospice, an 139. establishment need not be exactly the same. “Similar” does not mean identical or exactly the same: Mays v Roberts \[1928\] SASR 217 (SASC); NZ Central Region etc Local Government Officers’ Union v Lower Hutt City Council (1992) 1 ERNZ 558 (EmpC); Adelaide Caravan Park Pty Ltd v Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (1985) 7 ALD 756. In Case L75 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,435 at 1,440, Judge Keane considered that the premises in question, although not exactly the same as a hotel, a motel, an inn, a hostel or a boarding house (para (a)(i) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”), shared some significant defining features of such establishments, so were a commercial dwelling. The Commissioner considers that the significant defining features of convalescent homes, nursing homes, rest homes and hospices are the provision of accommodation and care and that to be similar an establishment must have those features. Therefore, potentially, units in a retirement village could be regarded either as a 140. collection of dwellings (each of the units being a place that is used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of a resident) or as a commercial dwelling (being a rest home or an establishment that is similar to a rest home). However, if para (b)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” applies to a unit situated in a retirement village, the unit is a dwelling (rather than part of a commercial dwelling) for the purpose of s 14(1)(c). In Wairakei, Chisholm J made the following comments on para (f) (at 15,209–15,210): In 1990 the definition of ‘commercial dwelling’ was amended (by inserting para (f)) to ensure that dwellings situated within a retirement village or a rest home complex would be governed by the same rules as other dwellings ie the supply of accommodation would be exempt. Notwithstanding the close links between such a dwelling and the remainder of the retirement 30 village or rest home complex Parliament had seen fit to notionally sever the dwelling from the remainder of the complex so that the dwelling would qualify as an exempt supply. The effect of para (b)(ii) is that if a retirement village contains dwellings (being units to which para (b)(iii) of the definition of “dwelling” applies), the retirement village as a whole will not be a commercial dwelling. Instead, the dwellings will be severed from the remainder of the village and will qualify as an exempt supply. Serviced apartments The reference to a serviced apartment in the definition of “commercial dwelling” 141. requires that it be “managed or operated by a third party for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986”. The Commissioner considers that accommodation in a retirement village can, on the face of it (depending on the specific facts), satisfy both the requirements to be a “serviced apartment” (ie, a commercial dwelling) and the requirements to be a “dwelling”. This will depend on whether the consideration required to be paid by the resident includes care services. Where the services provided are optional, then the accommodation could arguably satisfy both definitions (ie, “services in addition to the accommodation are provided” and “the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in the unit is for the right to occupy the unit”). However, a serviced apartment in a retirement village that satisfies para (b)(iii) of “dwelling” is deemed to be a “dwelling” (whatever it is called). Where the accommodation does not satisfy the requirements to be a “dwelling”, then it may be a “serviced apartment” or some other form of “commercial dwelling”. Participatory security Sometimes a retirement village, as part of its contractual arrangements with 142. residents, may issue a participatory security as well as a debt security. For example, a resident might be entitled to participate with other residents in the enjoyment of the village facilities. The issuance of a participatory security is the provision of a financial service and is an exempt supply for GST purposes. If an associated supply is supplied under a participatory security, the exemption 143. for financial services does not apply to the associated supply: s 14(1B). A right under a participatory security to receive a taxable supply for no consideration (other than the consideration for the participatory security) or a below-market consideration is an associated supply: see definition of “associated supply” in s 2. An associated supply is treated as a separate taxable supply: s 5(14B). The associated supply rules clarified the application of GST to supplies of financial 144. services following the decision in Gulf Harbour: Commentary on the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 (268-1) (Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, May 2005): 119. A “participatory security” for GST purposes: 145.  is an interest in or right to participate in any capital, assets, earnings or other property;  is an interest or right that forms part of a contributory scheme (as defined in the Securities Act 1978);  includes an interest in a unit trust; and  does not include an equity security, a debt security, money or a cheque. 31 In R v Smith \[1991\] 3 NZLR 740 (HC) at 748, Wylie J accepted that the concept 146. of participation involves some form of sharing with others, even if only with the promoter of the scheme. A “contributory scheme” is defined in the Securities Act 1978 as meaning: 147. any scheme or arrangement that, in substance and irrespective of the form thereof, involves the investment of money in such circumstances that— (a) the investor acquires or may acquire an interest in or right in respect of property; and (b) pursuant to the terms of investment that interest or right will or may be used or exercised in conjunction with any other interest in or right in respect of property acquired in like circumstances, whether at the same time or not;– but does not include such a scheme or arrangement if the number of investors therein does not exceed 5, and neither a manager of the scheme nor any associated person is a manager of any other such scheme or arrangement In Culverden, the Privy Council considered (in an obiter comment) that the 148. expression “investment of money” includes schemes under which the return is received in the form of capital (the initial investment) or in the form of income in cash or in kind (or both). A similar view was expressed in Munna Beach Apartments Pty Ltd v Kennedy \[1983\] 1 Qd R 151 (QSC) at 155-156, which concerned a similar concept (“investment contract”) in the Australian companies legislation. The court considered that an investment implied the payment of money in the expectation of some form of return, whether in the form of money or otherwise. Case law on the interpretation of “investment contract” under the Australian 149. companies legislation indicates the following:  For an interest or right in respect of property to be used or employed in common with the interest or right of other investors, there must be a sharing in the return from the investment. The main factor that must be considered is whether the purchaser is able to exercise individual control over the property.  Where the right obtained is the ownership of a specific apartment together with a share of the common area, each owner will merely be exercising their individual rights as co-owner of land to use the common area. See Munna Beach; Brisbane Unit Development Corp Pty Ltd v Deming No 456 Pty Ltd (No 2) \[1983\] 2 Qd R 92 (QSC); Jones v Acfold Investments Ltd (1985) 6 FCR 512 (FCA), Amadio Pty Ltd v Henderson (1998) 81 FCR 149 (FCA). A scheme with five or fewer investors is not a contributory scheme. This 150. exception would apply to a retirement village scheme if the scheme involved five or fewer residents. A contract may include separate and quite different securities: Culverden. In the 151. High Court in Fenton, Baragwanath J considered that a retirement village scheme involved both a debt security and a participatory security conferring on residents a right to occupy a unit in the village and to receive repayment of a deposit on termination of occupation. In the High Court in Norfolk, Robertson J considered that a licence for an apartment in a retirement village was a participatory security. In Covenant Trustee, a retirement village scheme was referred to as a participatory security for Securities Act 1978 purposes. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that, although a debt security cannot be a participatory security (being excluded from the definition of “participatory security”), a retirement village scheme could include more than one security and could include both a participatory security and a debt security. 32 The issue in Fenton was whether a proposal to sell land occupied by a bowling 152. green and to re-site the bowling green would be a breach of the retirement village’s obligation under the licence not to alter the basic scope and nature of the facilities provided as part of the village. The Court of Appeal in Fenton did not consider whether the scheme involved a “participatory security”. However, the court considered that the obligation under the licence not to alter the basic scope and nature of the facilities was indivisible (that is, a right owed to residents as a group). The court also considered that NZ Guardian Trust (which was both the trustee for the residents for the deposits and the statutory supervisor under the deed of participation) had separate obligations for the debt security and the participatory security. The obligations under the participatory security related to the protection of the residents under their licences, including the right to preservation of the basic nature and scope of the facilities provided as part of the village for the use of residents. This suggests that the rights of residents to the common areas and facilities were not individual rights, but rights enjoyed in common with other residents. In a situation where a retirement village involves a debt security and a 153. participatory security, residents have separate rights under the different securities. Under the debt security, residents have a right to be paid money (the repurchase price, loan or deposit). Under the participatory security, residents have a right to the use and enjoyment of the village facilities. Therefore, if a retirement village scheme includes a participatory security under 154. which an associated supply is made (the right to receive the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling for no consideration or for a consideration that is below the open market value), the consideration attributable to the supply of accommodation will be subject to GST. That being the case, if accommodation is supplied in a commercial dwelling, the supply of accommodation will be a taxable supply, whether or not a participatory security is also supplied. If an associated supply is supplied under a participatory security, the right is treated as a taxable supply for all purposes, including when applying the apportionment rules (discussed below from \[ 156\]). A table summarising the GST treatment of supplies made by retirement villages 155. to residents is provided as Appendix 1. Claims for input tax deductions by retirement villages Retirement village operators will purchase various goods and services when 156. constructing a retirement village or in the on-going operation of a village. Operators will need to determine the extent to which they can claim input tax deductions for those goods or services. Input tax means tax charged on a supply of goods or services acquired by a 157. person (s 3A(1)(a)). Input tax also arises where a registered person pays GST on imported goods (s 3A(1)(b)) and on certain purchases of secondhand goods (s 3A(1)(c), (2) and (3)). In calculating the tax payable for any taxable period, input tax may be deducted 158. to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: s 20(3C); definition of “input tax” in s 3A. An adjustment may need to be made if the extent to which a good or service is used for making taxable supplies changes. An input tax deduction might also be available on disposal of a good or service. A retirement village operator will need to calculate the amount of input tax that 159. may be deducted on acquisition of a good or service (under ss 20(3C) to (3J)). An input tax deduction is allowed on the acquisition to the extent the goods or 33 services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: s 20(3C). A retirement village operator may also need to calculate any subsequent adjustments under ss 21 to 21H where the actual use of the goods or services differs from the intended use (or previous actual use). Input tax deductions will not be available where a good or service has been 160. acquired under a zero-rated supply. The most important zero-rated supply in the current context is the zero-rated supply of land (which is discussed below from \[208\]). This Interpretation Statement addresses: 161.  how a retirement village operator calculates the amount of input tax that may be deducted on acquisition of a good or service;  how a retirement village operator makes adjustments in later periods for changes in intended use of a good or service; and  the possible input tax deduction when a retirement village operator disposes of a good or service. Further detailed discussion on the input tax deduction rules can be found in Tax 162. Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 33–42. Claiming an input tax deduction on acquisition of goods or services The general rule for determining how much input tax is deductible on acquisition 163. of goods or services is set out in s 20(3C)(a): (3C) For the purposes of subsection (3), and if subsections (3D) or (3L) do not apply,— (a) input tax as defined in section 3A(1)(a) or (c) may be deducted to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: The Commissioner considers that the inclusion of “available for use” in 164. s 20(3C)(a) means input tax deductions can be claimed on the acquisition of a good or service when the good or service is able to be used for making taxable supplies or is not otherwise occupied in or held for making non-taxable supplies. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “available” (Concise Oxford English Dictionary): available adj. 1 able to be used or obtained. 2 not otherwise occupied; free. The reference to “available for use” is discussed in Mixed-use assets – An officials’ 165. issues paper (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue and NZ Treasury, August 2011) at \[7.9\] and \[7.16\]: 7.9 In some cases, the goods or services may be available for use in, rather than being actively used for, making taxable supplies. For example, a commercial property developer may purchase raw materials that they intend to use in construction of a property at some time in the future. Although for a period of time the raw materials are not actively used for making taxable supplies, the property developer is still able to claim the related input tax deductions because the materials are “available for use” in making taxable supplies and will be actively used for that purpose at some time in the future. ... 7.16 The GST apportionment rules, as mentioned earlier, allow input tax deductions for goods and services that are not used for, but are available for use in, making taxable supplies. This treatment of non-use periods recognises that most goods or services are purchased by a GST-registered person for business reasons and will, at some point, be used for making taxable supplies. ... A person does not need to apportion costs used for both taxable and exempt 166. purposes if they believe on reasonable grounds that the total value of their 34 exempt supplies will be no more than the lesser of $90,000 or 5% of total consideration for all their exempt and taxable supplies: s 20(3D). A non-resident person does not need to apportion in certain circumstances: s 20(3L). The Commissioner does not consider that those provisions are likely to be relevant in the current context. Calculation method for determining input tax on acquisition The method used to calculate the amount that may be deducted as input tax 167. under the general rule in s 20(3C) is set out in s 20(3G) as follows: (3G) In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. The determination is expressed as a percentage of the total use. Under s 20(3G), a person must: (1) estimate at the time of acquisition how they 168. intend to use the goods or services; and (2) choose a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result (with the determination expressed as a percentage of the total use). Estimating intended use of the goods or services A full input tax deduction is allowed for a good or service that is intended to be 169. used solely for making taxable supplies (eg, that is used for the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling or other taxable supplies). In contrast, no input tax deduction is allowed for a good or service that is intended to be used solely for making exempt supplies (ie, in this context typically a good or service that is used for making supplies of accommodation in a dwelling or of a financial service). Where the relevant goods or services are to be used for making both taxable and 170. exempt supplies, then a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. For example, a retirement village operator can be using a common area or facility for making taxable supplies (to residents of commercial dwellings) and exempt supplies (to residents of dwellings) at the same time. When goods or services relating to the common area or facility are acquired, the retirement village operator must apportion the amount of input tax deducted based on their estimate of the extent to which those goods or services are used for making taxable supplies under s 20(3G). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 34 states that the 171. estimate could be made on the basis of any records that are available, previous experience, business plans or other suitable methods. The method of working out the extent of intended taxable use will largely depend on the nature of the goods and services in question. For example, if the asset is a car which is intended to replace an existing car used in the business, the logbook for the previous car could be a reasonable method of stipulating the intended use of the purchased car provided patterns of use were largely unchanged. Consistently with IS 10/08, the Commissioner also considers that measures based on distance travelled, time spent, the numbers of transactions of particular types, area used for different activities and the actual use of goods or services, usually give an accurate estimate of how a good is intended to be used or is used. Indirect estimation methods may be appropriate where there are overhead expenses that are not directly referable to particular supplies. Indirect methods that may be used are based on turnover or profit. Both subjective and objective factors are relevant in determining the intention: 172. Wairakei. However, there must be objective factors to support the taxpayer’s stated intention (such as resource consent applications, feasibility studies and 35 preliminary designs). In the retirement village context, it would be necessary to have regard to matters such as the nature of the development permitted by the resource consent, the disclosure statement required to be provided to prospective residents under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 and the form of the occupation right agreement intended to be entered into with residents. The nature of the accommodation supplied will normally determine whether land acquired and construction contracts entered into for the development of a retirement village were for the intention of making taxable supplies. The Commissioner considers that to the extent that part of a community centre (such as kitchens, restaurants and nursing stations) is used for the preparation and provision of meals and the provision of nursing care, such an area would be used solely for the making of taxable supplies. The Commissioner also does not accept that the dwellings in a retirement village 173. are used for making taxable supplies where the dwellings provide a catchment for the remainder of the village. Although it is likely that residents in a retirement village will require more care as they age and a retirement village may anticipate that residents will transfer from dwellings to a serviced apartment or rest home in the same village, there is no obligation on residents to do so. While dwellings are occupied as dwellings, they are used solely for making exempt supplies. The Commissioner considers that land, buildings and other assets in a retirement 174. village are not used for supplying debt securities. Debt securities are issued to finance the development of retirement villages. Hence, the objective of supplying debt securities is the acquisition of buildings where exempt or taxable supplies of accommodation and other services will be made. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the provision of debt securities by a retirement village is not relevant when determining if the intended use of a building (or any other asset) is to make exempt or taxable supplies. Relevance of a plan in developing a retirement village A retirement village operator may have established a plan for the development 175. and operation of the village that extends beyond the first adjustment period. The Commissioner considers that an operator’s estimate of how they “intend to use” the goods or services can include such a plan (if it provides a fair and reasonable result). The Commissioner also considers that the intended “use” can be to hold the relevant good or service available for making taxable supplies (where that provides a fair and reasonable result). Where a retirement village operator has a well-developed business plan to develop a retirement village in stages, then the Commissioner considers that it will provide a fair and reasonable result to take into account the overall plan (when estimating intended use). For example, a retirement village operator may have a well-developed business plan to build a retirement village where 30% of the units meet the definition of “dwelling” and 70% of the units meet the definition of “commercial dwelling”. Under the plan the operator first builds the units that meet the definition of “dwelling” and at a later stage builds the units that meet the definition of “commercial dwelling”. In this case, no input tax deduction will be allowed for any goods or services that are acquired solely for the building of the dwellings. A full input tax deduction is allowed on any goods or services that are acquired solely for the building of the commercial dwellings. The operator could apportion the input tax deduction claimed on acquisition on the basis of a 30% exempt / 70% taxable split on any goods or services acquired for both taxable and exempt purposes. If the situation was reversed and the commercial dwellings were built first, the same 30% exempt / 70% taxable apportionment would apply to the mixed use goods and services. This approach is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms “intend” and “use”. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “intend” and “use” as follows: 36 intend  v. 1 have as one’s aim or plan use  v. 1. take, hold, or deploy as a means of achieving something The ordinary meaning of “intend” relates to an aim or plan. The ordinary 176. meaning is broad enough to include an immediate or overall plan or aim. The word “use” also arguably incorporates a broad concept. It includes the idea of deploying something to achieve a purpose or end. It also includes holding that thing as a means of achieving something. While the matter is not without some doubt, the Commissioner also considers (on 177. balance) that the legislative purpose supports “intend to use” including the overall plan or aim (where that provides a fair and reasonable result). The key contextual elements supporting that conclusion are:  Overall purpose and scheme of the GSTA: The overall scheme of the GSTA is that input tax is not generally subject to timing rules: Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions – An officials’ issues paper (Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue and NZ Treasury, June 2008) at \[2.8\]. Instead, where a person has a taxable activity, the overall scheme suggests that input tax deductions are only disallowed where the relevant good or service is being used for making exempt or non-taxable supplies. This suggests that input tax should be able to be deducted for an established plan (which spans more than one adjustment period) to make taxable supplies.  Requirement to make an accurate estimate: The apportionment rules are aimed at getting the estimate of the intended use as accurate as possible on acquisition: see the Explanatory Note to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 (182-1) and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 33–42. To be an accurate estimation, the apportionment would arguably need to take into account all the known facts at the time of acquisition. For example, where the operator has a well-developed business plan that spans more than one adjustment period, then the Commissioner considers it may produce a more accurate “first instance” calculation to have regard to the overall plan. The Commissioner considers that taking into account any well-developed business plan is likely to improve the accuracy of an estimate of intended use.  Requirement to use a method that provides a fair and reasonable result: Section 20(3G) requires the method to provide a result that is “fair and reasonable”. The Commissioner considers that where a person has a well- developed business plan that extends over more than one adjustment period, it is fair and reasonable that any apportionment for goods or services intended to be used for making mixed supplies reflects that plan. At the end of the first adjustment period if the extent of the taxable use of the 178. goods or services that are intended to be used for making mixed supplies has changed over that period from what was estimated when those goods or services were acquired then an adjustment under s 21 may be required. This adjustment may result from the extent to which the goods or services have actually been used for making non-taxable supplies in the first adjustment period. Further adjustments may also be required in subsequent adjustment periods. The requirement to make adjustments in later periods is discussed in more detail from \[ 185\]–\[206\] and, specifically, in the case of business plans at \[193\]. Choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result As noted above at \[168\], the determination method must produce a fair and 179. reasonable result. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “fair” and “reasonable” as follows: 37 fair adj 1. Treating people equally  just or appropriate in the circumstances reasonable adj 1. Fair and sensible The word reasonable is, therefore, essentially defined as something that is fair. 180. The ordinary meaning of the words suggests that what is fair and reasonable depends on the circumstances. The Commissioner considers that choosing the determination method will be a factual matter that recognises the circumstances of the particular taxable activity in which the apportionment is required. Calculating the input tax deduction on acquisition The calculation method for input tax is set out in s 20(3H) and (3I) as follows: 181. (3H) The extent to which a deduction for input tax is allowed is calculated using the formula— full input tax deduction × percentage intended use. (3I) In the formula in subsection (3H),— (a) full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply: (b) percentage intended use has the meaning set out in section 21G(1)(b). Section 21G(1)(b) provides: 182. 21G Definitions and requirements for apportioned supplies and adjustment periods (1) For the purposes of this section and sections 8(4B)(b), 9(2)(h), 20(3H), 20G, 21 to 21F, and 21H,— ... (b) percentage intended use, for a registered person, means the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition under section 20(3G) and expressed as a percentage of total use: The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services determines the 183. proportion of the input tax that can be deducted on acquisition of a good or service (s 20(3H) and (3I)). Summary on deducting input tax on acquisition of a good or service In summary: 184.  A purchaser can deduct input tax on the acquisition of goods or services to the extent to which the goods or services are used for, or are available for use in, making taxable supplies: s 20(3C).  In determining the extent to which goods or services are used for making taxable supplies, a person must estimate at the time of acquisition how they intend to use the goods or services, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result: s 20(3G). The intention of the purchaser can include their overall plan or aim (where that provides a fair and reasonable result).  The estimated intended taxable use of the goods or services determines the proportion of the input tax that can be deducted: ss 20(3H) and (3I). Making adjustments in later periods Under the current apportionment provisions, subsequent adjustments may be 185. needed to the input tax deducted (or output tax paid under s 20(3J) in respect of zero-rated supplies – see \[ 212\] below) on acquisition of goods or services intended to be used for making mixed supplies if the extent to which the relevant goods or services are used by a retirement village operator for making taxable supplies changes. This may result because the extent to which the goods or 38 services are used for non-taxable purposes has changed in the adjustment period. Section 21 provides (as relevant): 21 Adjustments for apportioned supplies (1) A registered person must ascertain at the end of an adjustment period whether an adjustment is required to be made for any percentage difference in a supply of goods or services for the period in relation to the actual use of those goods or services for making taxable supplies. (2) Despite subsection (1), the person is not required to make an adjustment if— (a) section 20(3D) applies to them: (b) the value of the goods or services, excluding GST, is $5,000 or less: (c) the difference between the percentage intended use on acquisition and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000: (d) the difference between the previous actual use calculated for the most recent adjustment period in which an adjustment was made and the percentage actual use for the relevant adjustment period is less than 10 percentage points, but this paragraph does not apply if the adjustment amounts to more than $1,000. (3) An adjustment arises on the last day of the relevant adjustment period. Under s 21, a registered person has to determine whether an adjustment is 186. required at the end of each adjustment period (unless one of the de minimis exceptions in s 21(2) applies). Adjustment period An adjustment period is a set time period whereby the actual use of a good or 187. service is measured against the intended use of that good or service in that time period. The first adjustment period for a good or service starts on the date of acquisition of a good or service and ends on a date the person chooses that either corresponds to the person’s first balance date that falls after the date of acquisition, or to the person’s first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition: s 21G(2) and (3). All subsequent adjustment periods will be annual periods that start on the day after the end of the earlier adjustment period and end on the last day of the equivalent taxable period in which the first adjustment period ended. When an adjustment is required An adjustment to the input tax deducted on acquisition of a good or service is 188. required if at the end of an adjustment period there is a percentage difference between the percentage actual use and the percentage intended use or previous percentage actual use: 21A When adjustments required A registered person must, at the end of an adjustment period,— (a) identify the percentage actual use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies in the period; and (b) compare the percentage actual use with percentage intended use or previous actual use, as applicable; and (c) if a percentage difference arises and section 21(2)(c) or (d) does not apply, make an adjustment for any percentage difference for the adjustment period. The terms “percentage actual use”, “percentage intended use” and “percentage 189. difference” are defined in s 21G(1): 39 (1) For the purposes of this section and sections 8(4B)(b), 9(2)(h), 20(3H), 20G, 21 to 21F, and 21H,— (a) percentage actual use, for a registered person and an adjustment period,— (i) means the extent to which the goods or services are actually used by the person for making taxable supplies; and (ii) is calculated for the period that starts when the goods or services are acquired and finishes at the end of the relevant adjustment period; and (iii) is expressed as a percentage of total use: (b) percentage intended use, for a registered person, means the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition under section 20(3G) and expressed as a percentage of total use: (c) percentage difference means the difference between the percentage actual use determined under paragraph (a) and, as applicable,— (i) the percentage intended use determined under paragraph (b); or (ii) for a subsequent adjustment period following a period in which a person has made an adjustment, the previous actual use of the goods or services in the earlier period. The change in use is expressed as a percentage. The percentage difference 190. represents the difference between the “percentage actual use” and the “percentage intended use” or previous actual use. If there is a difference in the percentages, then an adjustment needs to be made for the adjustment period. If there is no difference in the percentages or if a de minimis exception in s 21(2) applies, then no adjustment is necessary. If an adjustment has already been made in a previous adjustment period, then 191. the person must compare the percentage actual use of the goods or services with the percentage actual use in the previous adjustment period (when the adjustment was made): s 21C. Determining “actual use” As noted above at \[176\], “use” has a broad meaning that includes deploying 192. something to achieve a purpose or end. It also includes holding that thing as a means of achieving something. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines “actual” as follows: actual  adj. 1. existing in fact; real. 2 existing now; current The word “actual”, therefore, means existing in fact, real or current. The 193. Commissioner considers, therefore, that “actual use” and “actually used” refer to the real or current way that a good or service is being deployed to achieve a purpose or being held as a means of achieving something. The Commissioner considers that where the input tax deduction on acquisition was determined according to the intended use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies, an adjustment will need to be made if the actual use of the relevant good or service differs from the intended use. For instance (as per the example at \[ 175\]) an input tax deduction on acquisition may be based on a well-developed business plan to build a retirement village made up of 30% of units that meet the definition of “dwelling” and 70% of units that meet the definition of “commercial dwelling”. However, in such cases an adjustment may need to be made at the end of the first adjustment period if the extent of the non-taxable actual use of the goods or services has changed over that period from that estimated when those goods or services were acquired. This may be necessary if the only supplies made during the adjustment period were exempt supplies of accommodation in a dwelling. This is because even though it can be said that 40 those good or services are being held for making taxable supplies of accommodation in the future, the goods or services are actually being used to make supplies of exempt accommodation in the adjustment period. Further adjustments may also be required in subsequent adjustment periods. If, however, during an adjustment period, goods and services are only being held for making future supplies, then no adjustment is required for the actual use of the goods and services for that adjustment period. This is because it is expected there will be no difference between the intended use and the actual use (assuming the intended use was based on a method that provides a fair and reasonable result i.e in this case, a well-developed business plan). Also, if the plan changes an adjustment will be needed in subsequent adjustment periods to reflect the change in use. Number of adjustment periods The higher the value of the goods or services supplied, the more adjustments 194. may need to be made. The rules achieve this by setting the number of adjustment periods for which a “change in use” comparison is required to be made. There is no limit to the number of adjustment periods for a supply of land: s 21G(5). Effectively this means a check needs to be made every year the land supplied is owned to ascertain if its use in making taxable supplies has changed in that period; if the use has changed an adjustment may be necessary. For other goods and services, there are two methods in s 21G(4) for determining 195. the number of adjustment periods for which “change in use” comparisons need to be made – a value-based method and an estimated-useful-life-based method. Under s 21G(4)(a), the maximum number of adjustment periods is determined by 196. certain GST-exclusive valuation bands for the relevant goods and services:  $5,000 to $10,000 – two adjustment periods;  $10,000 to $500,000 – five adjustment periods; and  $500,000 or more – ten adjustment periods. Alternatively, under s 21G(4)(b), registered persons are able to select the 197. maximum number of adjustment periods by reference to the estimated useful life of the asset, as determined under the Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations set by the Commissioner under s 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Under s 21G(6), once a taxpayer has chosen to limit the number of adjustment 198. periods, that choice cannot be subsequently changed. Calculating the adjustment The amount of the adjustment is the percentage value of the change in use: 199. s 21D. If the adjustment is an increase in the taxable use, then the amount is an additional deduction for input tax. If the adjustment is a decrease in the taxable use, then the adjustment is an amount of output tax. If the percentage value is unchanged at the end of the adjustment period, then no adjustment is required. Adjustment when use changes to total taxable or total non-taxable use In some circumstances, a retirement village operator may decide to change the 200. use of a good or service from being used for making both taxable and exempt supplies to being used for making only taxable or only exempt supplies. For example, a retirement village operator might change from having residents in both dwellings (exempt) and commercial dwellings (taxable) to having residents only in commercial dwellings. In that case, a common area constructed by the retirement village operator that had been used by residents of both dwellings and 41 commercial dwellings will be used only by residents of commercial dwellings. This would result in a total change in use adjustment in respect of any input tax deducted in relation to the construction of the previously mixed-use common area. Where there has been a total change in use, and the change persists for the remainder of the relevant adjustment period and the next adjustment period, operators must carry out a wash-up calculation under s 21FB. If the change is to a total taxable use, then an operator will be able to claim the total amount of input tax charged on the supply (s 21FB(3)(a)) less any deduction already claimed (s 21FB(3)(b)). If the change is to total non-taxable use, then output tax must be paid equal to any input tax deduction already claimed (s 21FB(3)(b)). Apportionment for concurrent uses of land As noted above at \[163 \], under the general apportionment rules, the input tax 201. deduction that a person is entitled to corresponds with the extent to which the asset is used, or is available for use, for taxable purposes: s 20(3C). However, a specific apportionment rule in s 21E applies where land is used for making concurrent taxable and non-taxable supplies. Unlike the general apportionment rule, s 21E determines the extent to which the 202. land is used for making taxable supplies by dividing the “consideration for taxable supply” by the “total consideration for supply”: s 21E(3). The “consideration for taxable supply” is the amount paid or payable on the disposal of the land in the adjustment period or the market value of the land at the time of the adjustment. The “total consideration for supply” is the “consideration for taxable supply” and the rental income for the supply of dwellings since the land was acquired or the market value of the rental income that would be payable if no rental income is paid. Under s 21E(2) the Commissioner can agree a different calculation method with the operator. The Commissioner considers that s 21E only applies to operators in limited 203. circumstances. Specifically, the Commissioner considers that s 21E applies where the operator is in the business of developing or buying retirement villages with the intention of selling them and leases or licences the dwellings in the village pending sale. In that situation, the operator would have to determine the extent to which the land is used for making taxable supplies under the formula in s 21E(3) (or under another calculation method agreed with the Commissioner under s 21E(2)) to determine whether an adjustment is required. The calculation method in s 21E(3) is described above at \[202\]. In brief, under s 21E(3), the operator would have to determine the amount paid on the disposal of the land (or, if not disposed of, the market value of the land) and divide it by the rental income paid or payable for the supply of the dwellings since the land was acquired (or the market value of the rental income for the dwellings if no rent is paid or payable). The Commissioner considers that s 21E does not apply where: 204.  the operator is supplying both taxable and exempt supplies of accommodation from different units in the same building, ie stacked vertically (as in Norfolk);  a common area or shared facility (such as a community centre) is used by both residents who are supplied with taxable accommodation and residents who are supplied with exempt accommodation. The Commissioner considers that s 21E does not apply in the circumstances 205. described at \[204\] because:  The use of both the terms “simultaneously” and “concurrent” suggests that the ordinary meaning of s 21E requires the relevant land to be used to the 42 full extent for both taxable supplies and exempt supplies (and this is arguably not the case in the above situations).  The reference to rent (and market value rent) from the supply of dwellings in the formula in s 21E(3) suggests that it was generally intended to apply in situations where the entire area was being rented out as an exempt supply (and this is not the case in the situations in \[204\]).  It appears that the mischief Parliament was intending to overcome was situations where the general apportionment provision would not work: see GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets – A government discussion document (Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, November 2009) at \[7.1\]–\[7.34\]. It is possible to apportion the supplies in the above situations, so that suggests that Parliament did not intend them to come within s 21E.  The statutory history suggests that s 21E was only intended to apply to situations that were very similar to those in CIR v Lundy Family Trust (2006) 22 NZTC 19,738 (CA) and so it was not intended to extend to the situations in \[204\].  The approach under s 21E was intended to be similar to the relevant Australian provision, which excludes the above situations (see GSTR 2009/4: Goods and services tax: new residential premises and adjustments for changes in extent of creditable purpose (ATO, 31 October 2012) at \[108\]–\[109\]). In summary, where a retirement village operator is in the business of developing 206. or buying retirement villages with the intention of selling them, and leases or licences the dwellings in the village pending sale, they will need to apportion under s 21E. Other situations involving the mixed use of land will generally be dealt with under the general apportionment sections (see above from \[ 163\]). Claiming an input tax deduction on the disposal of goods or services A retirement village operator may dispose, or be treated as disposing, of goods or 207. services that they have used for mixed purposes (ie, they claimed a partial but not a full input tax deduction). If the disposal (or deemed disposal) is in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity under s 8(1), the operator will need to carry out a calculation under s 21F. The calculation determines whether the operator can claim an additional input tax deduction. The amount calculated under the formula in s 21F(2), when added to any deduction (taking into account any adjustments) already claimed by the operator, must not be more than the total amount of the input tax on the original supply. There are special rules for land, which are discussed below at \[221\]. Land acquired for retirement village development Zero-rating of land acquired for village development A retirement village operator may acquire land for the development of a 208. retirement village. In that situation it would be expected that the acquisition of the land will be taxed at 0% (zero-rated), assuming the requirements of the zero- rating of land rules in s 11(1)(mb) are met: 11 Zero-rating of goods (1) A supply of goods that is chargeable with tax under section 8 must be charged at the rate of 0% in the following situations: ... (mb) the supply wholly or partly consists of land, being a supply— 43 (i) made by a registered person to another registered person who acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and (ii) that is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c); or Section 11(8B) provides: 209. (8B) Whether a supply of goods is zero-rated under subsection (1)(mb) is determined at the time of settlement of the transaction relating to the supply. Under the zero-rating of land rules, a supply will be zero-rated if (at settlement): 210.  the supply wholly or partly consists of land;  the supply is from a registered person to another registered person;  the purchaser acquires the goods (ie, the land and any other components of the supply) with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and  the supply of land is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them. Therefore, land acquired by a retirement village operator to develop a retirement 211. village will be a zero-rated supply if the vendor is GST registered, the operator intends to use the land for making taxable supplies, and the land is not intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the operator or of a person associated with the operator. Adjusting zero-rated land for non-taxable use Under s 20(3J) recipients of zero-rated supplies must on acquisition pay output 212. tax for any intended non-taxable use of the goods or services. This means that a retirement village operator who acquires land for development that was zero- rated under s 11(1)(mb) must on acquisition account for output tax under s 20(4) for any intended non-taxable use of the land (such as providing accommodation in a dwelling). The output tax is calculated by determining the nominal GST component of the 213. zero-rated acquisition and the extent the operator intends using the zero-rated goods or services in making taxable supplies. The output tax payable is then the proportion of the nominal GST component for any intended non-taxable use of the goods or services. So, when a retirement village operator acquires land for development that was zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb) the operator should:  identify the nominal GST component that would have been chargeable on the value of the supply of land had it not been zero-rated;  determine the extent to which they intend using the land for making taxable supplies (using the method set out under s 20(3G) (see above at \[167\]– \[168\]); and  account for output tax under s 20(4) for the proportion of the nominal GST component for any intended non-taxable use of that land. The amount of output tax is then checked and adjusted as necessary each year 214. under the adjustment rules in ss 21A to 21H for any change in use (see \[185\]– \[200\] above). To the extent that land acquired is held for future development and not actually used during an adjustment period, no adjustment for a change in use is required. 44 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 28–33 discusses the zero-215. rating of land rules. A brief summary of some specific issues that might be relevant for retirement villages is set out below, in particular:  the goods (land) need to be acquired “with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies”;  claims for input tax deductions where the land purchased is not zero-rated; and  the disposal of zero-rated land. Intention of using land for making taxable supplies When deciding if a retirement village operator’s acquisition of land for 216. development is a zero-rated supply under s 11(1)(mb), the Commissioner considers that the third requirement (above at \[210\]) is particularly relevant. The third requirement is that the purchaser must acquire the goods “with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies”. Retirement village operators will often acquire land with the intention of putting 217. both commercial dwellings and dwellings on the land. In other words, the operator will intend to use the land for making both taxable supplies and exempt supplies. The Commissioner considers that a supply of land can be zero-rated even if the operator only plans to use the land partly for making taxable supplies. In other words, the phrase “for making taxable supplies” is not limited to situations where the operator intends to use the land solely for making taxable supplies: the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010 (182-1) (Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and NZ Treasury, October 2010) at 4 and Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011): 28. Meaning of “intention” The Commissioner considers that “intention” in s 11(1)(mb) should be interpreted 218. consistently with “intend” in s 20(3G) (see above at \[175\]) because it is presumed that Parliament has used the relevant words consistently throughout the Act: New Zealand Breweries Ltd v Auckland City Corporation \[1952\] NZLR 144 (CA). This is especially the case in the present context because the apportionment provisions and the zero-rating of land rules were enacted in the same amendment Act. Further, the two sets of rules have a similar role in the GSTA in that they determine the amount of input tax or output tax that is receivable or payable on the acquisition of a good or service. This means that an acquisition of land can be zero-rated where a retirement 219. village operator’s overall plan is to use the land for making taxable supplies (as long as the plan is well-developed). In other words, it is not necessary for the purchaser to plan to make taxable supplies in the first adjustment period for a supply of land to be zero-rated. For example, where an operator has a well- developed business plan to develop a retirement village in stages (including building commercial dwellings in a subsequent adjustment period), then the acquisition of the land can be zero-rated. The Commissioner considers that a supply of land can be zero-rated where the 220. operator’s overall aim or plan is to use the land wholly or partly for making taxable supplies (where the plan is sufficiently well-developed). Disposal of zero-rated land by retirement villages As noted above, an acquisition of land by a retirement village operator for the 221. development of a retirement village is likely to be a zero-rated supply under 45 s 11(1)(mb). When the land was acquired the operator may have intended to use the land for making mixed supplies, so the operator may have paid an amount of output tax when the land was acquired to take account of the intended non- taxable use. In time, the operator may choose to dispose (or be treated as disposing) of the land in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity under s 8(1). In that situation, the operator needs to make a final calculation under the formula in ss 21F(4)–(7). The calculation determines whether the operator can claim an additional input tax deduction in respect of the non-taxable use portion. The amount calculated under the formula must not be more than the amount of output tax that was accounted for by the person under s 20(3J)(a)(iii) (in effect, the initial amount of the output tax paid together with any later adjustments made under the apportionment rules: s 21F(6)). Examples It is not possible to provide examples relating to every factual situation that may 222. arise for supplies made or received by retirement villages. The following examples are intended to provide guidance on common situations. Example 1 – Establishment of a retirement village with licensed units RV Ltd is building a retirement village. RV Ltd purchased land from a GST 223. registered vendor with the intention of building a block of 50 apartments and 200 stand-alone villas, roads, landscaped gardens and a community centre, including a lounge, kitchen, dining room, nursing station, library, theatre and bowling green. The cost of the common areas and facilities amounted to $2 million. A licence for an apartment or villa is granted to residents. Under the licence, 224. residents have a right to use the common areas and facilities. Residents are required to pay an up-front facilities fee of $50,000 and are required to make an interest-free loan of $250,000. The facilities fee accrues to RV Ltd at the rate of $10,000 per year over five years. The loan is repaid when the resident leaves the village. Residents of apartments are required to pay a weekly periodic fee for accommodation and care services (including the provision of meals and linen, the cleaning of their room or apartment, and the provision of activities and outings and nursing services). Residents of the villas are required to pay a lower periodic fee because the fee does not include the provision of care services. If residents of the villas require any additional services such as meals or nursing services, an additional charge is payable. As the consideration that residents of the apartments are required to pay in order 225. to be entitled to the supply of accommodation is for both accommodation and care services, the supply of accommodation in the apartments is the supply of accommodation in a commercial dwelling. The supplies of accommodation and care services are taxable supplies for which the consideration is the facilities fee and the periodic fees. GST is chargeable on the facilities fee and the periodic fees paid by residents of the apartment. The villas are dwellings, as the consideration that residents must pay in order to 226. be entitled to the supply of accommodation relates solely to the supply of accommodation, including the right to use the common areas and facilities (which are appurtenances of the dwellings). The supply of accommodation in the villas under the licence is an exempt supply. GST is not chargeable on the payments made by residents of the villas, except additional payments for the supply of meals or care services made at the request of residents. RV Ltd is not entitled to any input tax deductions for the purchase of the land 227. because it is a zero-rated supply. Further, RV Ltd will have to return output tax to the extent that the land is intended to be used for the villas and their share of 46 the appurtenances. RV Ltd is entitled to an input tax deduction for goods and services used for constructing the apartments. An input tax deduction is not allowable for goods and services used for constructing the villas, as they are used for making exempt supplies of accommodation. The goods and services used for the construction of the roads, landscaped 228. gardens and the community centre can be apportioned according to the extent that they are intended to be used for making taxable supplies, choosing a determination method that provides a fair and reasonable result. An apportionment on the basis that the common areas and facilities will be used according to the proportion of the taxable and exempt accommodation in the village (20% taxable versus 80% exempt) would seem to be fair and reasonable. At the end of the first adjustment period, if the extent those goods or services used in the construction of the roads, landscaped gardens and community centre are actually used for making exempt supplies of accommodation is different from the estimate, then an adjustment under s 21 may be required. This may be the case say, if only exempt supplies of accommodation have been made in the first adjustment period. Further adjustments may also be required in subsequent adjustment periods. The kitchen, dining room and nursing station will be exclusively used for making taxable supplies so input tax deductions will be allowable for goods or services in those areas. In this example, the amount of the input tax deductions for the operating costs of the common areas and facilities has been calculated on the basis of the ratio of dwellings to commercial dwellings in the retirement village. However, another method of calculating an input tax deduction would be acceptable if it provides a fair and reasonable result. Example 2 – Establishment of a retirement apartment complex ABC Ltd owns and operates a retirement village that comprises an apartment 229. building that includes garages, a library, theatre, kitchen, dining room and nursing station and is surrounded by gardens, paths and driveways. ABC Ltd constructed the village. The land for the village was purchased from a vendor who was not GST registered. A lease for life for a resident’s apartment and a garage in the basement of the 230. building, together with a right to use the common areas and facilities of the village, is granted to residents. Residents are required to pay an entry payment of $300,000. On the termination of the lease, the entry payment is repaid to residents less the following charges:  a facilities fee of $50,000; and  the refurbishment costs, the amount of which depends on the period of occupation. Residents are also required to pay a weekly periodic fee for the management of the village. Residents have an option of receiving meals or care services on payment of an additional charge. The apartments are dwellings, as the consideration payable in order to be entitled 231. to occupy an apartment in the village (the facilities fee, the periodic fee and the refurbishment costs) relates solely to the supply of accommodation (including the right to use the common areas and facilities, which is an appurtenance of the apartments, and including management services, which are incidental or ancillary to the supply of accommodation). GST is not chargeable on the facilities fee, the periodic fee and the refurbishment costs, as these payments are consideration for the exempt supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire. Any additional payments for the optional supply of care and other services relate to a taxable supply and are subject to GST. The entry payment is not consideration for the 47 supply of the debt security or the supply of accommodation, so it is not subject to GST. The supply of land to ABC Ltd is not zero-rated because the land is acquired from 232. a non-registered vendor. As a result, ABC Ltd is entitled to claim an input tax deduction to the extent that it intends to use the land for making taxable supplies. Specifically, ABC Ltd could claim input tax deductions to the extent that the land is to be used for providing meals and care services (ie, the land set aside for the kitchen, dining room and the nursing station). An input tax deduction is not allowed for the construction costs relating to the 233. apartment building and the common areas and facilities (ie, the library, theatre, gardens, paths and driveways). However, input tax deductions would be allowed for the construction and on-going costs of the kitchen, dining room and nursing station. Example 3 – Rest home complex expands to include villas XYZ Co Ltd acquires land for the development of a rest home complex from a 234. GST-registered vendor. The rest home beds are intended for residents who require a high level of care. The rest home is a commercial dwelling (para (a)(iii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”). The supply of accommodation and care in the rest home is a taxable supply. XYZ Ltd is not allowed any input tax deductions for the land because the supply of the land is zero-rated. XYZ Ltd does not have to return any output tax on the supply of the land because it intends to use the land solely for making taxable supplies. Input tax deductions are allowed for the construction costs incurred in developing the rest home complex. A decision is later made to expand the rest home complex by constructing 200 235. villas and a community centre that includes a kitchen, a dining room, administration areas and recreational facilities available to residents of the villas. A licence to occupy is granted for the villas. Residents of the villas must pay a refundable deposit of $300,000. The deposit is refundable on termination of occupation. Residents must also pay a facilities fee of $50,000 on termination of occupation and periodic fees. As the consideration payable by residents for the supply of accommodation relates solely to the right to occupy a villa, the villas are dwellings and the supply of accommodation in the villas is an exempt supply. XYZ Ltd will have to make an adjustment for the change in use of the land in the 236. relevant adjustment period and following. The adjustments will arise because the intended use was originally solely for making taxable supplies and subsequently the actual use is partly for making taxable supplies and partly for making exempt supplies. In that regard the adjustments must take into account the completely taxable use of the land until the decision to expand is taken. This is because the actual use needs to be determined from the period that started when the land was acquired to the end of the relevant adjustment period. The extent to which the land is used for making exempt supplies may be calculated on a time and space basis if that provides a fair and reasonable result. However, the adjustment may also be calculated on the basis of the proportion of the turnover from the making of taxable and exempt supplies (or another method of calculation) if the method provides a fair and reasonable result. XYZ Ltd will have to return output tax according to the difference between the intended use and the actual use. 48 References Related rulings/statements IS 10/08: “Retirement villages – GST treatment”

(5) For the purposes of the formula in subsection (4),— (a) tax fraction has the meaning given in section 2(1), unless subsection (7) applies to the disposal: (b) consideration is the amount of consideration received, or treated as received, for the supply: (c) previous use is the percentage intended use or the previous actual use in the period before the period in which the disposal occurs. (6) The amount given by the formula in subsection (4) must not be more than the amount of output tax that is accounted for by the person under section 20(3J)(a)(iii), taking into 60 account any later adjustments made under the apportionment rules in sections 21 to 21H. (7) In the formulas in subsections (2) and (4), on the disposal of the goods or services, if the supply is charged at the rate of 0%, the item tax fraction is treated as 15%. 18. Section 21FB provides: 21FB Treatment when use changes to total taxable or non-taxable use (1) This section applies when— (a) a person makes an adjustment under section 21A or 21B; and (b) the person’s use of the goods or services in making taxable supplies changes in an adjustment period to either total taxable use or total non-taxable use; and (c) the total taxable use or non-taxable use remains unchanged for an unbroken period that is— (i) the remainder of the adjustment period in which the use was changed; and (ii) the adjustment period following the period in which the use was changed. (2) If the use changes to total taxable use, the person’s adjustment for the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii) is an amount of input tax calculated using the formula— full input tax deduction − actual deduction. (3) In the formula,— (a) full input tax deduction is the total amount of input tax on the supply, after taking into account any nominal GST component chargeable under section 20(3J)(a)(i): (b) actual deduction is the amount of deduction already claimed, taking into account adjustments made up to the end of the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii). (4) If the use changes to total non-taxable use, the person’s adjustment for the adjustment period referred to in subsection (1)(c)(ii) is an amount of output tax that is equal to the amount of the person’s actual deduction as described in subsection (3)(b). 19. Section 21G provides: 21G Definitions and requirements for apportioned supplies and adjustment periods (1) For the purposes of this section and sections 8(4B)(b), 9(2)(h), 20(3H), 20G, 21 to 21F, and 21H,— (a) percentage actual use, for a registered person and an adjustment period,— (i) means the extent to which the goods or services are actually used by the person for making taxable supplies; and (ii) is calculated for the period that starts when the goods or services are acquired and finishes at the end of the relevant adjustment period; and (iii) is expressed as a percentage of total use: (b) percentage intended use, for a registered person, means the extent to which the goods or services are intended to be used by the person for making taxable supplies, estimated at the time of acquisition under section 20(3G) and expressed as a percentage of total use: (c) percentage difference means the difference between the percentage actual use determined under paragraph (a) and, as applicable,— (i) the percentage intended use determined under paragraph (b); or (ii) for a subsequent adjustment period following a period in which a person has made an adjustment, the previous actual use of the goods or services in the earlier period. (2) For the purposes of this section and sections 20G, 21 to 21F and 21H,— (a) the first adjustment period is a period that— (i) starts on the date of acquisition; and 61 (ii) ends on the date as the person chooses that either corresponds to the person's first balance date described in section 15B(6) that falls after the date of acquisition, or corresponds to the person's first balance date that falls at least 12 months after the date of acquisition: (b) a subsequent adjustment period is a period of 12 months that— (i) starts on the day after the end of an earlier adjustment period; and (ii) ends on the last day of the equivalent taxable period in which the first adjustment period ended. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), a registered person who chooses under section 38(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to change their balance date at some time in an income year may realign their subsequent adjustment periods with the new balance date. However, an affected adjustment period must be of at least 12 months duration and, if the new balance date causes an adjustment period to be shorter than 12 months, the relevant period is extended to the balance date of the following income year. (4) The number of adjustment periods in which a registered person must determine whether an adjustment is required under sections 20G and 21A, as applicable, may, as the person chooses, be limited to— (a) one of the following based on the value of the goods or services, excluding GST: (i) 2 adjustment periods for goods or services valued at more than $5,000 but not more than $10,000: (ii) 5 adjustment periods for goods or services valued at more than $10,000 but not more than $500,000: (iii) 10 adjustment periods for goods or services valued at more than $500,000; or (b) the relevant adjustment periods that is equal to the number of years for the estimated useful life of the relevant asset as determined under the Tax Depreciation Rates Determinations set by the Commissioner under section 91AAF of the Tax Administration Act 1994. (5) Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to a supply of land. (6) An election by a registered person under subsection (4) to limit the number of adjustment periods applying to goods or services acquired by them cannot subsequently be changed. (7) Despite subsection (4) if, after making adjustments for goods or services for the number of adjustment periods, the person subsequently disposes, or is treated as disposing, of the relevant asset, they must make a final adjustment under section 21F in the taxable period in which the disposal occurs. (7B) If a person disposes, or is treated as disposing, of an asset before the last required adjustment period under subsection (4), then for the purposes of subsection (2)(a)(ii) and (b)(ii), the current adjustment period is treated as— (a) ending immediately before the date of the disposal; and (b) the final adjustment period. (8) If a person does not choose the number of adjustment periods for an apportioned supply, the limits set out in subsection (4)(a) apply. Residential Tenancies Act 1986 20. Section 38 provides: 38 Quiet enjoyment (1) The tenant shall be entitled to have quiet enjoyment of the premises without interruption by the landlord or any person claiming by, through, or under the landlord or having superior title to that of the landlord. (2) The landlord shall not cause or permit any interference with the reasonable peace, comfort, or privacy of the tenant in the use of the premises by the tenant. (3) Contravention of subsection (2) in circumstances that amount to harassment of the tenant is hereby declared to be an unlawful act. (4) In this section premises includes facilities. 62 Securities Act 1978 21. Section 2 provides: 2 Interpretation (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... contributory scheme means any scheme or arrangement that, in substance and irrespective of the form thereof, involves the investment of money in such circumstances that— (a) the investor acquires or may acquire an interest in or right in respect of property; and (b) pursuant to the terms of investment that interest or right will or may be used or exercised in conjunction with any other interest in or right in respect of property acquired in like circumstances, whether at the same time or not;— but does not include such a scheme or arrangement if the number of investors therein does not exceed 5, and neither a manager of the scheme nor any associated person is a manager of any other such scheme or arrangement

This statement covers the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers who purchase, lease, licence, develop, or commission software for use in a business carried on for the purposes of deriving assessable or excluded income. The statement expressly refers only to taxpayers that are carrying on a business. However, except where otherwise stated, the principles in this statement also apply to taxpayers who incur expenditure on software in deriving assessable or excluded income (otherwise than in the course of carrying on a business). Classified Public 2 2. This statement does not consider:  the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers that develop software for third parties – e.g to earn income from the sale or licence of the software (software developers);  the treatment of software funded by a government grant and, in particular, the application of s DF 1; or  the application of any specific research and development provisions other than s DB 34; or  any potential withholding tax obligations that a taxpayer may have – for example, for royalties or interest paid to a non-resident software supplier, or for services provided by a non-resident contractor. These issues are covered in IG0007 “Non-resident software suppliers’ payments derived from New Zealand – Income tax treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 15, No 11 (November 2003) (it is noted that this statement is due to be reviewed). Summary 3. The following is a brief summary of the main income tax implications of acquiring or developing software for use in a business. Further details are set out in the analysis section below. Software purchases  Software purchased will generally be a capital asset that must be depreciated at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line.  An immediate write-off for software costing less than $500 will be allowed where the conditions in s EE 38 are satisfied.  Maintenance costs may be deducted when incurred.  Upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Periodic payments for the right to use or access software  Periodic payments for the right to use or access software (often online software) are generally deductible when incurred. Software developed in-house for use in business  Expenditure incurred in undertaking feasibility studies to determine whether to develop software will generally be deductible.  Once a decision has been made to proceed with the development, any expenditure incurred beyond that point should be capitalised until the software is either completed or abandoned.  If the software is completed for use in the taxpayer’s business, the cost of the software can be depreciated at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line.  If software is abandoned before it becomes depreciable property, a deduction may be allowed for the expenditure incurred in developing the software. Classified Public 3  Expenditure incurred in maintaining software once it has been completed will generally be deductible when incurred.  Upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software  Expenditure on software commissioned by a taxpayer for use in its business should be capitalised until the software is complete. The costs can then be depreciated over the life of the item.  If the software is abandoned before it becomes depreciable property, a deduction may be allowed for the expenditure incurred in developing the software. Lease of software under finance lease  Software leased under a finance lease is treated as a sale of software by the lessor to the lessee. Also, the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the software and the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the software.  The Act then applies to the arrangement as recharacterised.  The financial arrangements rules apply to the loan.  The depreciation rules apply as if the lessee owned the software.  The treatment at the end of the finance lease depends on who acquires the rights to the software at the end of the lease term. Introduction 4. In 1993, the Commissioner published a policy statement setting out the income tax treatment of computer software (see Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993)). Since then, there have been a number of legislative changes that mean that parts of that item are now out of date. 5. This item updates and replaces the 1993 item except for the parts of that item that deal with taxpayers carrying on a software development business. Analysis 6. This statement covers the income tax treatment of software for taxpayers who:  purchase software for use in their business;  make periodic payments for the right to use software (other than under a finance lease) in their business;  develop software in-house for use in their business;  commission software development for use in their business; or  lease software under a finance lease for use in their business. 7. Each of these situations is considered below. As the depreciation provisions are relevant to four of the situations, a more general discussion on depreciation is included after the discussion of the specific scenarios. Classified Public 4 Software purchases 8. When software is purchased (whether “off the shelf” or online), generally the purchase price will be paid for the right to use the software (in the form of a licence). A taxpayer who acquires software for use in a business gets an enduring benefit. The expenditure incurred is capital in nature and non-deductible, but the taxpayer can claim depreciation on the software over its life. 9. The cost of maintaining the software is deductible expenditure under s DA 1. The cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail below (from \[35\]). Periodic payments for the right to use or access software 10. Where a taxpayer makes periodic payments for the right to use or access software (other than software leased under a finance lease), the payments will generally not give rise to a capital asset. This can occur, for example, where a taxpayer pays a periodic licence fee for the right to use software or where a taxpayer pays a subscription fee to access software online (also known as software as a service). The payments will be deductible under s DA 1 (subject to the general limitations in s DA 2). A deduction will be allowed in the income year that the expenditure is incurred, unless a specific timing provision applies. Software developed in-house for use in business 11. A business (not including a software development business) may develop software in-house for use in its own business. Developing software in-house will generally create a capital asset. The tax treatment of the costs incurred in the software development will differ for different phases of the development. More detailed principles relating to the deductibility of expenditure incurred in developing or acquiring a capital asset are set out in the interpretation statement IS 08/02: “Deductibility of Feasibility Expenditure” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No. 6 (July 2008): 12). However, in summary, the following principles apply. Expenditure determining whether the software is feasible 12. Expenditure incurred in undertaking feasibility studies to determine whether to develop a capital asset will generally be deductible under s DA 1(1) (assuming the asset is to be used in the taxpayer’s income earning process). In the context of software development, this means that expenditure incurred analysing the feasibility of developing a piece of software for use in a business would be deductible. That is, expenditure incurred principally for the purpose of placing a taxpayer in a position to make an informed decision about the development of some software will not generally be expenditure incurred in relation to that software. Expenditure developing the software 13. Once a decision has been made to proceed with the development, any expenditure incurred beyond that point will relate to the software. From that point on, expenditure should be capitalised until the software is either completed or abandoned. This includes both direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs include personnel costs directly attributable to the project, and depreciation costs on hardware dedicated to the project. Indirect costs are overhead costs that cannot be directly linked to a particular project. These may include general overhead costs (such as rates, rent, insurance, and energy costs), indirect labour costs, and indirect material costs (such as paper, and printer toner). 14. Direct costs should be relatively easy to calculate (for example personnel costs can be calculated by recording the direct hours spent by staff on a project). Classified Public 5 15. Indirect costs (including utility costs, rental or ownership costs of property etc...) should be allocated using a method that gives a fair and reasonable result. A possible allocation method might be based on the proportion of direct person hours allocated to the project. Where accurate time recording is not undertaken, a functional analysis of what each employee working on the project does may be appropriate. However, a taxpayer can use another method if it can be shown that it is appropriate. For example, in some circumstances, a method based on the proportionate time and space used for the project may be appropriate. 16. If the software is completed for use in the taxpayer’s business its cost can be depreciated (see from \[35\] below). To be depreciable, the software must be used or available for use. In the Commissioner’s view, a piece of software will be available for use when it is capable of being used for the purpose that it was developed. This is likely to be after it has been tested to determine that it works as intended and when it is ready (or materially ready) to ‘go live’. 17. For depreciation purposes, s EE 18B includes the amount of expenditure incurred in developing the software as part of the cost of the copyright in the software. The copyright in the software is the depreciable property, as it is listed in sch 14. If the software is developed as a series of modules that can be operated independently, each module can be depreciated as it is implemented. At that time it will be “depreciable property”, and will be used or available for use in the taxpayer’s business. 18. If the software is abandoned before there is an item of depreciable property, s DB 40B may allow a deduction (see from \[28\] below). Research and development (R&D) expenditure 19. An alternative treatment may be available where the expenditure on software is “research” or “development” and is recognised as an expense for financial reporting purposes 1 . 20. The main provision of the Act applicable to R&D expenditure is s DB 34. Section DB 34 allows a deduction for expenditure (other than expenditure excluded under s DB 34(6)) incurred on R&D by those persons who:  recognise the R&D expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes under either of two designated financial reporting standards (s DB 34(2));  recognise the R&D expenditure as an expense for financial reporting purposes because it is written off as an immaterial amount but, had it been material, would have been required to recognise it as an expense for financial reporting purposes under either of the two designated financial reporting standards (s DB 34(4)); or  incur R&D expenditure of $10,000 or less in an income year, have recognised it as an expense for financial reporting purposes (but not, necessarily, under either of the designated reporting standards) and have written the amount off as immaterial (s DB 34(5)). 21. “Research” and “development” are both defined in paragraph 8 of the New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place. 22. Taxpayers who incur R&D expenditure (excluding interest) can claim the deduction in the income year the expenditure is incurred or they can choose to allocate the 1 See Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 26, No 4 (May 2014) for a discussion of the relationship between the minimum financial reporting requirements for companies under the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 and the references to financial reporting standards in the Income Tax Act 2007. Classified Public 6 expenditure to a later income year in accordance with s EJ 23. A deduction can only be made in a later income year if there is income that arises as a result of the R&D expenditure in that year (R&D income). A taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction under s DB 34 has the option of not taking the deduction. They have the option of returning their income and expenditure on the basis that the section does not apply (s DB 34(8)). 23. If applied, the R&D rules override the capital limitation but the general permission and other general limitations still apply (s DB 34(10)). Post-development maintenance and upgrades 24. Expenditure incurred in maintaining software once it has been completed will generally be revenue in nature and deductible under s DA 1. This would include expenditure such as fixing programming bugs, providing help desk facilities and making minor changes to the software - that is, routine changes that do not materially increase the capacity or performance of the software. 25. Expenditure on upgrades (or improvements) to the software will be capital in nature. A change will be an upgrade when it adds new features to the software, or increases its capacity, performance or life. The cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Other post-development expenditure 26. The capital cost of an item includes any expenditure on installation and getting the item ready for using to earn income (see BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 12 ATD 204 and IS 10/06 “Deductibility of business relocation costs” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 8 (September 2010)). Therefore, any expenditure on installing or integrating the software with the taxpayer’s system will be capital. 27. Other post-development expenditure will usually be deductible under s DA 1. These costs could include, for example, producing instruction manuals and staff training. Unsuccessful software 28. Section DB 40B overrides the capital limitation and provides a deduction for expenditure incurred on unsuccessful software development (to the extent that a deduction has not already been allowed). It only applies where the software was being developed for use in the taxpayer’s business. T he development of the software must be abandoned before the copyright in the software becomes “depreciable property”. Section DB 40B also requires that the copyright in the software would have been depreciable property if the development had been completed. 29. If the requirements of s DB 40B are met, a deduction (for both the current year expenditure and the expenditure capitalised in earlier income years) is allowed in the income year in which the development of the software is abandoned. Sale of copy of developed software 30. A taxpayer who has developed software for use in their business (and capitalised and depreciated the development costs) may also subsequently sell a copy to a third party. For example, a manufacturing business may sell a copy of the stock control software used in its business to another manufacturing business. The proceeds of the sale will be assessable income. 31. The taxpayer should continue to depreciate the development costs. If there are costs associated with producing the second copy of the software (for example, the costs of printing manuals and training materials), these will be deductible. Classified Public 7 Commissioned software 32. Commissioned software is treated the same as software developed in-house (see from \[11\] above). Software commissioned by taxpayers for use in their business will be a capital asset. The costs must be capitalised until the software is complete. The costs can then be depreciated over the life of the item. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail below (from \[35\]). 33. If the development is abandoned before the software is completed, s DB 40B may apply to allow a deduction for the costs incurred. See \[28\] and \[29\] above. The treatment of post-development expenditure is the same as for software developed in-house (see from \[24\] above). 34. Where the expenditure on the software is “research” or “development” expenditure, s DB 34 may apply to allow an earlier deduction. See from \[19\] above. Depreciation 35. Under s EE 6, for property to be depreciable, it must be property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used (or available for use) in a business. For intangible property to be depreciable, it must also be listed in sch 14. Schedule 14 includes the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, and the right to use software (such as under a licence). The property must also not be subject to any of the exclusions in s EE 7 (for example, low value property that has been dealt with under s EE 38). 36. The depreciation rate for the copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, and the right to use software is 50% diminishing value or 40% straight- line. An immediate write-off for software costing less than $500 will be allowed where the conditions in s EE 38 are satisfied. 37. If a taxpayer has a number of low value items of depreciable property (each item being below the maximum pooling value in s EE 65 (generally $5,000)), the taxpayer may be able to use the pool method to depreciate the group of items. The requirements for using the pool method are set out in ss EE 20 to EE 24, EE 65 and EE 66. 38. The cost of software upgrades (improvements) must be capitalised and depreciated (at 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line). Section EE 37 sets out how improvements should be depreciated. It provides for improvements to be treated as separate items of depreciable property from the item being improved. 39. If a taxpayer believes that their particular software should have a higher or lower rate than that set by the Commissioner, the taxpayer can apply to the Commissioner for a special rate under s 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The requirements for an application, including the associated fees, are set out in the Income Tax (Depreciation Determination) Regulations 1993. For a special rate to be given, a taxpayer needs to demonstrate that the economic life of their software is either greater or less (as the case may be) than four years (which is the economic life on which the 50% diminishing value and 40% straight line rates are based). The consequences of obtaining a special rate are set out in s EE 36. When software disposed of or no longer used 40. Sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply where a person receives consideration from the disposal of an item of depreciable property in the circumstances described in ss EE 44 to EE 47. They set out how to calculate an amount of depreciation recovery income or depreciation loss and may give rise to an amount of income or deduction. Relevantly, however, ss EE 48 to EE 52 do not apply when a person Classified Public 8 disposes of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind. 41. Section EE 39 applies when a person has an item of depreciable property (other than property that had been depreciated using the pool method) that is no longer used. Section EE 39(4) provides that a person will have an amount of depreciation loss if:  they no longer use the item in their business, and  neither they nor an associated person intends to use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income, and  the costs of disposing of the item would be more than any consideration they could derive from disposing of it. 42. When the above criteria are met, a taxpayer will have an amount of depreciation loss equal to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year. The taxpayer will be entitled to a deduction for this amount under s DA 1. The item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year will then be zero. 43. Sometimes, taxpayers may not wish to or may not be able to dispose of their software when it is no longer useful. Also, sometimes, rather than being disposed of, old software may be incorporated into a new version. The Commissioner’s view is that, where the software is still capable of being used by the taxpayer, it can continue to be depreciated. Where the software is incorporated into a new piece of software, the Commissioner’s view is that the software is still used or available for use and can continue to be depreciated. Lease of software under finance lease Meaning of “finance lease” 44. “Finance lease” is defined in s YA 1: finance lease means a lease of a personal property lease asset entered into by a person on or after 20 May 1999 that— (a) when the person enters the lease, involves or is part of an arrangement that involves— (i) the transfer of the ownership of the asset to the lessee or an associate of the lessee during or at the end of the term of the lease: (ii) the lessee or an associate of the lessee having the option of acquiring the asset for an amount that is likely to be substantially lower than the asset’s market value on the date of acquisition: (iii) a right of an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, or a right of the lessor to require an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, during the term of the lease under an arrangement that does not entitle the associate to receive all of the personal property lease payments that may fall due after the acquisition: (b) when the person enters the lease or from a later time, involves a term of the lease that is more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life as defined in section EE 63 (Meaning of estimated useful life): (c) the person enters on or after 20 June 2007 and is, or is part of, an arrangement that, when the person enters the lease or when a change in the terms of the arrangement changes the allocation or size of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset,— (i) involves the use of the asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease; and (ii) involves income of any person who is not the lessor, arising from the use of the asset by any person, that is exempt income, or excluded income, or non-residents’ foreign sourced income; and Classified Public 9 (iii) is a finance lease under NZIAS 17 for the lessor, or for a company that is in the same group of companies as the lessor and derives assessable income from the arrangement, or is an arrangement under which persons who do not include the lessor bear substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the lease asset, determined as at the time the person enters the lease and taking into account later changes to the arrangement 45. The term “lease” is defined in s YA 1. Relevantly, for the purposes of the finance lease provisions, it treats two or more consecutive or successive leases of the same property (to the lessee or an associate) as a single lease. 46. Therefore, a lease will be a “finance lease” if it meets the criteria in one or more of paras (a), (b), or (c) of the definition. 47. Broadly, para (a) captures arrangements where ownership of the lease asset is transferred to a lessee (or an associate), or the lessee (or an associate) has an option to acquire the lease asset for substantially below market value. It also applies where the arrangement involves a right of an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, or a right of the lessor to require an associate of the lessee to acquire the asset, during the term of the lease where the associate is not entitled to receive all of the lease payments after the acquisition. 48. Paragraph (b) applies where, either when the person enters the lease, or at a later date, the term of the lease is greater than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life. 49. Paragraph (c) will apply less commonly. In particular, it only applies where the leased asset is used outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involves exempt income, excluded income or non-residents’ foreign sourced income arising from the use of the asset (other than by the lessor).

When personal property is leased under a finance lease, the lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset by the lessor to the lessee on the date on which the term of the lease starts (s FA 6). Also, the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the lease asset and the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the lease asset. The Act then applies to the arrangement as recharacterised. 51. As the lease is recharacterised as a sale with an associated loan, the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW apply. For the lessor, the amount of the loan is determined under s EW 32 (s FA 7(1)). For the lessee, the amount of the loan is determined under ss EW 32 and EW 33 (s FA 7(2)). 52. The depreciation rules in subpart EE also apply. The lessee is treated as the owner of the software (s FA 8(2)) and the lessor is not treated as the owner of the software. The depreciation treatment is discussed in more detail above (from \[35\]). 53. Where an operating lease becomes a finance lease, the lessor and lessee must both adjust their income and expenditure. Section FA 11 sets out the requirements and formula for the adjustments. Treatment when the lease ends 54. Section FA 9 sets out the treatment at the end of a finance lease where the lessee acquires the asset. When a lessee acquires the software by the end of the lease term, the acquisition is treated as the same sale that was previously treated as occurring under s FA 6. Where the lessee (or an associate) acquires the software and later disposes of it for more than the consideration they paid, the excess is income of the lessee under s CC 11 (unless it is income under another provision of the Act). The income must be returned in the income year in which the lessee (or associated person) disposes of the asset (s FA 9(3)(a)). Classified Public 10 55. Section FA 10 sets out the treatment where the lessor is treated as acquiring the asset at the end of the lease (because the lessee has not acquired the lease asset by the end of the lease). Examples 56. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 – periodic payments for access to online software 57. United Chemists Ltd runs a chain of pharmacies. It uses online accounting software for financial reporting, invoicing, inventory management and payroll. United Chemists pays a subscription fee of $50 per month to access the software online. United Chemists wants to know whether this fee is deductible. 58. The fee is deductible under s DA 1. Example 2 – unsuccessful software developed in-house for use in taxpayer’s business 59. Sell To Me Ltd sells household goods online. It stores the goods in five large warehouses around New Zealand. In the 2014 income year Sell To Me Ltd decided to develop some new inventory management software. It employed a computer science student (Stanley) to undertake this work and purchased a computer that was used 50% by Stanley and 50% for other business purposes. 60. Stanley works on the software for three months during a holiday break from university. In total, Sell To Me Ltd incurred expenditure of $50,000 developing the software. This amount includes Stanley’s wages, 50% of the depreciation on the computer for the relevant period, and rent and utilities for the office space leased for Stanley to work in. Stanley was never able to make the software function correctly. After three months, he left Sell To Me Ltd and returned to university. In the 2015 income year, Sell To Me Ltd discovers that it is going to cost a further $50,000 to complete the software. It decides to abandon development of the software and purchase an off the shelf inventory management system instead. Sell To Me Ltd wants to know how the software development costs should be treated for income tax purposes. 61. In the 2014 income year, a decision has already been made to proceed with the software development. Therefore, the expenditure incurred is capital and not deductible in the 2014 income year. The expenditure is also not depreciable in the 2014 income year as there is no completed asset available to be used in the taxpayer’s business. In the 2015 income year, Sell To Me Ltd decides to abandon the software. It is entitled to a deduction for all of the expenditure incurred in the development of the unsuccessful software. Example 3 – software commissioned for use in taxpayer’s business 62. In the 2013 income year, Bank With Me Ltd contracts with XYZ Software Limited to design and implement a new app to allow its customers to undertake banking transactions from their smart phones. Bank With Me will receive all rights to the app once it is complete. The software is completed in the 2015 income year. After completion, XYZ runs a two day training course for Bank With Me’s staff to teach them how to use the new software. XYZ also provides ongoing maintenance services once the app is running. Bank With Me wants to know how to treat the payments that it makes to XYZ for income tax purposes. 63. The development costs incurred by Bank With Me on the app software must be capitalised until the 2015 income year when the app software is completed. At Classified Public 11 that time, it will be available for use in the taxpayer’s business and the costs can be depreciated. 64. Once the app software is complete, any payments for maintenance services will be deductible when they are incurred. 65. The costs of training staff to use the app once it is complete are revenue in nature and are deductible when incurred. Maintenance 66. A short time later, one of the major mobile phone software providers upgrades its operating system. Bank With Me’s app will not run on the upgraded system so Bank With Me hires XYZ Software again to make the relatively minor modifications required so that the software will run on the new operating system. At the same time, XYZ Software also fixes a number of minor bugs. Bank With Me wants to know whether the costs of the changes should be treated as capital or revenue. 67. The changes to Bank With Me’s app are revenue and can be deducted when incurred. As operating system software is upgraded relatively frequently, making modifications to software so that it can run on the upgraded system is more in the nature of maintenance rather than an upgrade. The changes do not add any new functionality as such. Rather they allow the app to continue to run consistently with its original specifications. The fact that a few minor bugs were fixed at the same time does not change this conclusion. Upgrade 68. The following year, Bank With Me decides to make some modifications to the app to allow users to make payments directly to other app users via Bluetooth. Bank With Me again hires XYZ Software to make the changes. 69. The change adds a material new function to the software and, as such, is an upgrade and should be capitalised and depreciated in accordance with s EE 37. Example 4 – allocation of indirect costs for in-house developer 70. XYZ Insurance Ltd has an in-house operation which develops software for use in the insurance company’s business. In the last income year the software development operation worked on one major project and spent the rest of the time on maintenance work for existing software. 71. The in-house operation employs two staff for software development and maintenance work. Each staff member works 1,000 hours a year. Project Development work (hours) Maintenance work (hours) Total Jack 800 200 1,000 Jill 600 400 1,000 Total 1,400 600 2,000 Indirect overhead costs allocated to software development operation for income year: $100,000 Allocation of indirect overhead to project: Total hours worked =2,000 hours Proportion of hours worked for project =1,400 / 2,000 =0.7 Indirect overhead costs of project =$100,000 × 0.7 Classified Public 12 =$70,000 72. Therefore, besides the direct costs of the project, XYZ Insurance Ltd must capitalise an additional $70,000 of indirect overhead cost for the project. When the development is completed capitalised costs will be deductible under the depreciation regime. Example 5 – software still undergoing testing 73. XYZ Accounting Ltd is a large national accounting firm. It commissions Brittany to develop a new document management system. 74. At the end of April, Brittany completes the initial development and the software is operational. During May and June the software undergoes extensive testing by two of XYZ Accounting’s staff members. During this time a number of issues are identified that require further development. In July, Brittany completed the required changes. A final testing phase is carried out in August. On 1 September it is determined that the software is ready to go live. The actual rollout to all staff occurs on 1 October. A number of minor bugs are identified and Brittany fixes these on 1 November. 75. XYZ Accounting wants to know when it can start depreciating the software. The software was available for use in the taxpayer’s business from 1 September and can be depreciated from this date. Prior to this the software was not available for use as it was still being tested and it had not been determined that it could be used as intended. It is not necessary for XYZ Accounting to wait until the software is actually rolled out for use by staff (as long as it is capable of being used). Nor does it matter that the software still contains some minor bugs.

The general permission must still be satisfied and the other general limitations still apply. 5. The relevant provisions from subpart EE state: EE 6 What is depreciable property? Description (1) Depreciable property is property that, in normal circumstances, might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use— (a) in deriving assessable income; or Classified Public 16 (b) in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. Subsections (2) to (4) expand on this subsection. Property: tangible (2) An item of tangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is described by subsection (1); and (b) it is not described by section EE 7. Property: intangible (3) An item of intangible property is depreciable property if— (a) it is within the definition of depreciable intangible property; and (b) it is described by subsection (1); and (c) it is not described by section EE 7. ... EE 7 What is not depreciable property? The following property is not depreciable property: (a) land other than depreciable intangible property, although buildings, fixtures, and the improvements listed in schedule 13 (Depreciable land improvements) are depreciable property if they are described by section EE 6(1): (ab) a lease of land with a perpetual right of renewal: (b) trading stock: (c) livestock to which subpart EC (Valuation of livestock)) applies: (d) financial arrangements: (e) excepted financial arrangements other than depreciable intangible property: (f) property that will not decline in value, as far as its owner is concerned, because, when they dispose of it, they have a right to be compensated for any decline in its value: (g) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 8, to treat as not depreciable: (h) property that its owner chooses, under section EE 38, to deal with under that section: (i) property for whose cost a person other than the property’s owner is allowed a deduction: (j) property for whose cost a person is allowed a deduction under a provision of this Act outside this subpart or under a provision of an earlier Act, except for an asset to which section DU 6(4) (Depreciation) applies. EE 18B Cost: some depreciable intangible property For the purposes of section EE 16 and this subpart, the cost to a person for an item of depreciable intangible property or a plant variety rights application (the amortising item) includes an amount of expenditure incurred by the person for an item of intangible property (the underlying item) if— (a) the underlying item gives rise to, supports, or is an item in which the person holds, the amortising item; and (b) the amount of expenditure is incurred by the person on or after 7 November 2013, if the amortising item is 1 of— (i) a patent or a patent application with a complete specification lodged on or after 1 April 2005: (ii) plant variety rights: (iii) a plant variety rights application: (iv) a design registration: Classified Public 17 (v) a design registration application: (vi) industrial artistic copyright; and (c) the person is denied a deduction for the expenditure under a provision outside this subpart. EE 36 Using economic rate or provisional rate instead of special rate Allowed to use economic or provisional rate (1) A person may depreciate an item to which a special rate applies by applying, instead, the economic rate applicable to the item or a provisional rate applicable to the item. This subsection is overridden by subsection (2) Not allowed to use economic or provisional rate (2) The person must not depreciate the item by applying the economic rate or the provisional rate, if— (a) a special rate applies to the item; and (b) the special rate is higher than the economic rate; and (c) the person applies the special rate to the item for an income year; and (d) in a later income year, the item’s market value declines at a rate equal to or greater than the special rate; and (e) it is a reasonable conclusion from all the circumstances of the case that the person’s purpose, or 1 of the person’s purposes, in wanting to change from the special rate to the economic rate or the provisional rate for the later income year is to enable the person to defer the deduction that the person is allowed for the amount of depreciation loss for the item’s decline in value. EE 37 Improvements When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person makes an improvement to an item of depreciable property. Income year in which improvement made (2) In the income year in which the person makes the improvement, the provisions of this subpart apply to the improvement, as if it were a separate item of depreciable property, in the period that— (a) starts at the start of the month in which the person first uses the improvement or has it available for use; and (b) ends at the end of the income year. Following income years (3) For income years following the income year in which the person makes the improvement,— (a) a person who uses the diminishing value method or the straight-line method for the item that was improved may choose to apply subsection (4) or (5), if paragraph (ab) does not apply: (ab) a person who uses the diminishing value method or the straight-line method for the item that was improved must use subsection (3B) if— (i) treating the improvement as an item, section EE 31(2A) does not apply, but section EE 31(3A) does apply; and (ii) the item that was improved is a grandparented structure, or is not a building, is not a used import car, is not an international aircraft, or has not been used or held for use in New Zealand as an item of depreciable property before the date on which the person acquires it: (b) a person who uses the pool method for the item that was improved must apply subsections (6) and (7). Improvement compulsorily treated as separate item Classified Public 18 (3B) For the purposes of subsection (3)(ab), a person must treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property. Improvement treated as separate item (4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), a person may choose to treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property. Improvement treated as part of item (5) For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), a person may choose to treat the improvement as part of the item of depreciable property that was improved. They must do 1 of the following for the first income year, after the income year in which they made the improvement, in which they use the improvement or have it available for use: (a) if they use the diminishing value method for the item, add the improvement’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year: (b) if they use the straight-line method for the item,— (i) add the improvement’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year to the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year; and (ii) add the improvement’s cost to the item’s cost. Pool method (6) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), a person who uses the pool method for the item that was improved must treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property. If its cost is equal to or less than its maximum pooling value, they must include it in a pool in the first income year, after the income year in which they made the improvement, in which they use the improvement or have it available for use. Adjustment of pool’s value (7) When an improvement is included in a pool under subsection (6),— (a) the pool’s adjusted tax value is increased by the improvement’s adjusted tax value on the date it is included in the pool; and (b) the improvement’s adjusted tax value at the end of the previous income year is included in starting adjusted tax value in section EE 21(5). EE 39 Items no longer used When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person in an income year has an item of depreciable property that— (a) is no longer used or, because the geothermal energy proving period has ended, becomes unavailable for use under section EE 6(4); and (b) is not a building, unless the item meets the requirements of subsection (2); and (c) has not been depreciated using the pool method. ... Amount of depreciation loss under this section (3) The person has an amount of depreciation loss under this section and under no other provision of this subpart. Circumstances (4) The person has an amount of depreciation loss if— (a) they no longer use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and (b) neither they nor a person associated with them intends to use the item in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income; and (c) the costs of disposing of the item would be more than any consideration they could derive from disposing of it. Amount Classified Public 19 (5) The amount of depreciation loss is the item’s adjusted tax value at the start of the income year. Adjusted tax value at end of year (6) The item’s adjusted tax value at the end of the income year is zero. EE 44 Application of sections EE 48 to EE 52 When sections apply (1) Sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply when a person has consideration from the disposal of an item or from an event involving an item, if— (a) the consideration is consideration of a kind described in section EE 45; and (b) either— (i) the item is an item of a kind described in section EE 46; or (ii) the event is an event of a kind described in section EE 47. Exclusions (2) Sections EE 48 to EE 52 do not apply when— (a) a person disposes of an item of intangible property as part of an arrangement to replace it with an item of the same kind: (b) a person’s patent application has concluded because a patent is granted to the person in relation to the application: (c) a person’s geothermal well becomes unavailable for use under section EE 6(4) because the geothermal energy proving period has ended: (d) a person receives, for an item of property, an amount of insurance to which section EZ 23B (Property acquired after depreciable property affected by Canterbury earthquakes) applies. EE 45 Consideration for purposes of section EE 44 General rule (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, the consideration equals the amount that a person derives excluding any GST charged if the person is a registered person, as modified by subsections (3) to (11) minus the amount (the disposal cost) that they incur in deriving that amount, to the extent to which the disposal cost— (a) is not allowed as a deduction to the person other than as a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss; and (b) is not counted in “the amount that a person derives”. GST for disposal costs (1B) All amounts deducted or deductible by the person under section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in relation to the disposal cost described in subsection (1) are subtracted from the disposal costs under that subsection. Consideration may be zero or negative (2) For the purposes of section EE 44, the consideration may be zero or a negative amount. Other than market value (3) If the person has consideration that is not the item's market value, the amount that the person derives is the item’s market value. Three qualifications are— (a) if the person makes a taxable supply, “market value” means the market value minus any GST that would be charged on the supply: (b) this subsection does not apply to a transfer under a relationship agreement; and (c) this subsection does not apply in a case described in any of subsections (5) to (10). Relationship with subpart FC (4) Subsection (3) does not apply to a disposal of property to which any of sections FC 3 and FC 4 (which relate to the distribution or transmission of property) applies. Classified Public 20 Change of use or location of use (5) The consideration that a person derives from the event described in section EE 47(2) is the item’s market value. Two qualifications are— (a) if the person makes a taxable supply, “market value” means the market value minus any GST that would be charged on the supply: (b) this subsection does not apply to a transfer under a relationship agreement. Loss or theft (6) The amount that a person derives from the event described in section EE 47(3) is the amount of insurance, indemnity, or compensation they receive for the loss or theft (amount A). If the person is a registered person, amount A does not include the amount, if any, of GST charged on amount A to the extent to which amount A is treated as being consideration received for a supply of services by the registered person under section 5(13) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. ... Repossession (9) The amount that a person derives from the event described in section EE 47(5) is the item’s cost minus the net amount paid. Two qualifications are— (a) if the person is a registered person, the “amount that a person derives” does not include any GST charged on a taxable supply they make: (b) “net amount paid” means the amount paid by the buyer to the seller for the item under the contract minus any amount refunded by the seller to the buyer. Other items (10) The amount that a person derives from the disposal of an item along with any other item, or from the occurrence of an event involving an item that also involves other items, is the item’s market value. Two qualifications are— (a) if the person makes a taxable supply, “market value” means the market value minus any GST that would be charged on the supply: (b) this subsection does not apply to a transfer under a relationship agreement. Item leaving New Zealand permanently (11) The amount that a person derives from the event referred to in section EE 47(10) is described in section EZ 21(1) (Sections EE 45 and EE 47: permanent removal: allowance before 1 April 1995). EE 46 Items for purposes of section EE 44 Items to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, an item of property to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply is an item of depreciable property that a person owns, including— (a) an item for which the person has been allowed a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss they have had under section EE 33; and (b) an item to which section CZ 11 (Recovery of deductions for software acquired before 1 April 1993) applies. Exclusions (2) Sections EE 48 to EE 52 do not apply to— (a) an item of property that, on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, is accounted for in a pool; or (b) an item of petroleum-related depreciable property; or (c) an item of intangible property that is excluded depreciable property, other than software; or (d) a land improvement that is excluded depreciable property of a kind for which no deduction for depreciation was allowed under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. EE 47 Events for purposes of section EE 44 Classified Public 21 Events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, this section describes the events to which sections EE 48 to EE 52 apply. Change of use or location of use (2) The first event is the change of use, or change of location of use, of an item of property, as a result of which a person is denied a deduction for an amount of depreciation loss for the item for the next income year. The event is treated as occurring on the first day of the next income year, and includes a change in use of an item for the purposes of the definition of commercial fit-out and a change in the status of a building related to an item for the purposes of that definition. Loss or theft (3) The second event is the loss or theft of an item of property, if the item is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Irreparable damage or damage rendering building or grandparented structure useless (4) The third event is— (a) the irreparable damage of an item of property that is not a building or grandparented structure; or (b) the damage of an item of property that is a building or grandparented structure, or of the neighbourhood of the building or grandparented structure, causing the building or grandparented structure to be— (i) useless for the purpose of deriving income; and (ii) demolished or abandoned for later demolition. Repossession (5) The fourth event is the seller’s repossession of an item of property to which section EE 3 applies because the buyer wholly or partly fails to pay the consideration. The event is treated as occurring on the date on which the item is repossessed. Unused geothermal well brought into use (6) The fifth event is, for a person’s geothermal well that is unavailable for use under section EE 6(4) because the geothermal energy proving period has ended, is when the person starts to— (a) use the well in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income: (b) have the well available for use in deriving assessable income or carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income.

Item leaving New Zealand permanently (10) The ninth event is described in section EZ 21(2) (Sections EE 45 and EE 47: permanent removal: allowance before 1 April 1995). EE 48 Effect of disposal or event Amount of depreciation recovery income Classified Public 22 (1) For the purposes of section EE 44, if the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs, the lesser of the following amounts is the amount of depreciation recovery income derived by the person : (a) the amount by which the consideration is more than the item’s adjusted tax value on the date on which the disposal or the event occurs; and (b) the amount given by subsections (1B) and (1C). Amount for subsection (1)(b) (1B) The amount for the purposes of subsection (1)(b) is given by the following formula: item depreciation loss + CZ 11 item amount + DB 64 item amount.

Maximum amount of deduction allocated to income year (4) The person must not allocate to an income year (the current year) an amount of deductions referred to in subsection (1) that is more than the greater of— (a) the amount of assessable income referred to in subsection (2)(a) that the person derives in the current year: (b) the amount of the deductions that— (i) arise in other income years from which a loss balance may be carried forward under Part I to the current year; and (ii) have not been allocated to income years before the current year. 7. The relevant provisions from subpart FA state: FA 6 Recharacterisation of amounts derived under finance leases When a personal property lease asset is leased under a finance lease, the lease is treated as a sale of the lease asset by the lessor to the lessee on the date on which the term of the lease starts, and— (a) the lessor is treated as giving a loan to the lessee for the lease asset; and (b) the lessee is treated as using the loan to buy the lease asset; and (c) subpart EE (Depreciation), the financial arrangements rules, and the other provisions of this Act apply to the arrangement as recharacterised. FA 7 Determining amount of loan Value to lessor (1) For a lessor under a finance lease, the amount of the loan is determined under section EW 32 (Consideration for agreement for sale and purchase of property or services, hire purchase agreement, specified option, or finance lease). Value to lessee (2) For a lessee under a finance lease, the amount of the loan is determined under sections EW 32 and EW 33 (which relate to the value of consideration under the financial arrangements rules). FA 8 Deductibility of expenditure under finance lease Lessee treated as owner (1) The lessee under a finance lease is treated as the owner of the personal property lease asset for the purposes of subpart EE (Depreciation). Lessor not treated as owner (2) The lessor under a finance lease is not treated as the owner of the personal property lease asset for the purposes of subpart EE. FA 9 Treatment when lease ends: lessee acquiring asset Classified Public 28 Acquisition treated as sale (1) When a lessee under a finance lease acquires the personal property lease asset by the date on which the term of the lease ends, the acquisition is treated as the same sale that is treated as occurring under section FA 6. When lessee or associated person acquires lease asset and later disposes of it (2) If a lessee under a finance lease, or a person associated with them, acquires the lease asset and later disposes of it for an amount that is more than the consideration they paid for it, the excess is income of the lessee under section CC 11 (Lessee acquiring lease asset on expiry of term of lease). Allocation and association (3) For the purposes of subsection (2),— (a) the excess is income of the lessee in the income year in which the lessee or associated person disposes of the asset: (b) association is determined at the time of acquisition by the associated person. Exception (4) Subsection (2) does not apply if the consideration derived on the disposal is income of the lessee or an associated person under a provision of this Act other than this section. FA 10 Treatment when lease ends: lessor acquiring asset When this section applies (1) This section applies when a finance lease ends by the date on which its term ends. Acquisition by lessor at end of lease (2) If the lessee does not acquire the personal property lease asset by the date on which the term of the lease ends, the lessor is treated as having acquired it on that date at its guaranteed residual value. If there is no guaranteed residual value, the consideration is treated as zero. In this section, the consideration is called the notional sale price. Further sale, assignment, or lease (3) Subsections (4) and (5) apply when the lessor sells, assigns, or leases the lease asset to another person under another finance lease on or after the date on which the term of the original lease ends. When consideration more than notional sale price (4) If the consideration is more than the notional sale price,— (a) to the extent to which it is paid by the lessor to the lessee under the original finance lease, the notional sale price is increased by the amount of the difference; and (b) to the extent to which it is not paid by the lessor to the lessee under the original finance lease, the amount of the difference is income of the lessor under section CC 12 (Lessor acquiring lease asset on expiry of term of lease) in the income year in which the original lease term ends. When consideration less than notional sale price (5) If the consideration is less than the notional sale price, and the lessee is required to pay the amount of the deficit to the lessor, the notional sale price is reduced by that amount. Acquisition by lessor when lease ends early (6) If the lease is terminated before the end of its term and the lessee does not acquire the lease asset, the lessor is treated as acquiring it for an amount calculated using the formula— outstanding balance − release payment. Definition of items in formula (7) In the formula,— (a) outstanding balance is the amount of the outstanding balance of the loan on the date on which the lease is terminated: Classified Public 29 (b) release payment is the amount the lessee paid to be released from their obligations under the lease. Relationship with section EE 45 (8) Subsections (2) to (6) override section EE 45 (Consideration for purposes of section EE 44). FA 11 Adjustments for leases that become finance leases When this section applies (1) This section applies when a lease is entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and— (a) the lease is a consecutive or a successive lease— (i) that is treated as 1 lease under the definition of lease; and (ii) with a term of the lease that the lessor and lessee do not contemplate, at the start of the term, will be more than 75% of the personal property lease asset's estimated useful life; and (iii) with a term of the lease that is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life: (b) the lease is an operating lease that becomes a finance lease under paragraph (c) of the definition of finance lease. Adjustment required (2) The lessor and lessee must each adjust their income and expenditure calculated for the lease by including an adjustment in a return of income for the tax year corresponding to the income year in which the lease becomes a finance lease. Amount of adjustment (3) The amount of the adjustment is calculated for the relevant person in relation to the period described in subsection (5) using the formula— finance income − finance expenditure − unadjusted income + unadjusted expenditure. Definition of items in formula (4) In the formula,— (a) finance income is the income that would have been derived by the person under the lease if the lease were a finance lease for the period: (b) finance expenditure is the expenditure that would have been incurred by the person under the lease if the lease were a finance lease for the period: (c) unadjusted income is the income derived by the person under the lease: (d) unadjusted expenditure is the expenditure incurred by the person under the lease. Adjustment period (5) The period starts on the date on which the lease starts and ends on the last day of the income year in which the lease becomes a finance lease. Adjustment positive (6) If the adjustment is positive, the amount is income of the relevant person under section CH 6 (Adjustments for certain finance and operating leases). Adjustment negative (7) If the adjustment is negative, the amount is a deduction of the relevant person under section DB 51B (Adjustments for leases that become finance leases). FA 11B Adjustments for certain operating leases When this section applies (1) This section applies when a lease is an operating lease that— (a) is entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and before 20 June 2007; and Classified Public 30 (b) is an arrangement, or part of an arrangement that, on 20 June 2007, meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(i) to (iii) of the definition of finance lease; and (c) has a term of the lease ending after the end of the income year in which 20 June 2007 falls (the adjustment year); and (d) does not meet the requirements of section FA 11(1) before the end of the income year after the adjustment year. Adjustment required (2) The lessor must adjust their income and expenditure calculated for the lease asset by including an adjustment in a return of income for the tax year corresponding to the income year after the adjustment year. Amount of adjustment (3) The amount of the adjustment is calculated using the formula— total depreciation losses ÷ 6 Definition of item in formula (4) In the formula, total depreciation losses is the total amount of depreciation loss for the lease asset for which the lessor is allowed a deduction in the period that begins with the start of the term of the lease and ends with the end of the adjustment year. Income (5) The amount of the adjustment is income of the lessor under the lease under section CH 6 (Adjustments for certain finance and operating leases) in the income year after the adjustment year. Adjusted tax value (6) The adjusted tax value of the lease asset at the beginning of the income year after the adjustment year is the total of the amount of the adjustment and the adjusted tax value that the lease asset would have in the absence of this section. Depreciation loss (7) For an income year beginning after 20 June 2007 in which the lease is an operating lease, the amount of depreciation loss allowed for the lease asset other than under section EE 48 (Effect of disposal or event) is five-sixths of the amount of depreciation loss that would be allowed for the lease asset in the absence of this subsection. 8.

A registered person who enters into a contract with a recipient to supply several goods and services needs to determine what sort of supply or supplies they have made so they can correctly account for GST. Where multiple elements are supplied with potentially different GST treatments, the supplier must determine whether they have made a single composite supply (of all the elements) with a 2 Unclassified single GST treatment, or multiple separate supplies (of each element or a combination of elements) with different GST treatments. 2. In some cases, it may be clear from the contract that only a single element is supplied to the recipient. Boundary issues do not arise on the supply of a single element. 3. Boundary issues may arise where multiple elements are supplied together. Boundary issues arise where some elements of the supply are subject to GST at the standard rate and other elements are zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST at all. If the GST treatment of each element of the supply is the same then boundary issues do not arise. 4. Sometimes the Act deems supplies of multiple elements to be treated in a particular manner (for example, ss 5(20B), 5(20) and 5(15)). Where the Act does not deem a particular outcome, the arrangement actually entered into and carried out between the supplier and recipient must be carefully considered. The answers to the following questions may help a registered person to decide whether they have made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies:  What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient for their payment?  What are the relationships between the elements supplied?  Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 5. The first question requires a registered person to identify the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient. This is determined objectively and examines what is supplied from the recipient’s perspective. 6. The fact elements supplied to the recipient could have been supplied separately does not mean those elements should be severed from the rest of the supply. In addition, the fact a single price is charged to the recipient does not determine whether one or more than one supply is made. It is the actual supply made to the recipient that must be considered and not how the supply is invoiced or charged to the recipient. 7. In considering the second question, namely the relationships between the different elements supplied, the courts consider whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The phrases “ancillary or incidental to” and “necessary or integral part of” are different descriptions of a similar test. The facts of each case will determine which description is more appropriate. Factors that indicate that elements are ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, a dominant element include whether the element is:  not an aim in itself; instead, the element facilitates, contributes to, or enables the supply of the dominant element;  a means of better enjoying the dominant element;  an optional extra and is not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. 8. The third question to answer is whether a sufficient distinction exists between the different elements of a transaction to make it reasonable to sever them into 3 Unclassified separate supplies. This question requires taking an overall view and looking for the essential purpose of the transaction and not artificially splitting what, from an economic point of view, is a single supply. If, on an objective assessment, it is not reasonable to sever the different elements of the transaction, then there will be only one composite supply. 9. If there is one composite supply, the zero-rating provisions may apply to zero- rate part or all of the supply. The compulsory zero-rating of land provisions may mean the supply is zero-rated if it includes land: s 11(1)(mb). Additionally, despite being a single composite supply, part of the supply may be required to be zero-rated: ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B. If the zero-rating provisions do not apply, the GST treatment will follow the dominant element of the supply. If there is no dominant element (for example, the supply is made up of several equally important elements that are integral to each other), the GST treatment will be determined by the overall characteristics of the single composite supply. 10. If there are multiple supplies, the relevant provisions of the Act are applied to each supply. Where the recipient pays a global amount for multiple supplies with different GST treatments, the consideration is apportioned under s 10(18) between taxable supplies and non-taxable or exempt supplies. 11. The process is summarised in the following flowchart. The flowchart is intended to be an aid to interpretation only. A more detailed discussion of the process follows the flowchart: 4 Unclassified 5 Unclassified Introduction 12. GST is imposed on the supply of goods and services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by a registered person by reference to the value of the supply: s 8(1). Supply is defined broadly to include “all forms of supply”: s 5(1). Supplies can be subject to GST at the standard rate, or be zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST. Issues can arise where different elements of a supply are potentially subject to different GST treatments. These issues are referred to as “boundary issues”. 13. Boundary issues arise only where multiple elements are supplied. Contracts for the supply of a single element do not raise boundary issues. Boundary issues primarily arise where some elements of the supply are subject to GST at the standard rate and other elements are zero-rated, exempt or not subject to GST. If the GST treatment of each element of the supply is the same, then boundary issues do not arise. Unlike other jurisdictions, New Zealand has relatively few boundary issues. 14. Where multiple elements are supplied with potentially different GST treatments, the supplier must determine whether they have made a single composite supply with a single GST treatment or multiple separate supplies with different GST treatments. 15. The single composite supply or multiple separate supplies issue arises in various scenarios. For example:  language schools – whether the supply of language tuition (standard-rated) is a separate supply from pre-arrival assistance services (zero-rated), which was considered in Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) and is discussed from \[41\];  credit card surcharges – whether the charge for paying by credit card (exempt) can be separated from the goods or services being paid for (standard-rated); and  loyalty cards – whether the supply of loyalty points (standard-rated) is a separate supply from the supply of credit card services (exempt). 16. The Commissioner considered specific single composite supply or multiple separate supplies issues in the following items:  “Financial Planning Fees – GST Treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001): 37 (IS0079). This statement addresses the GST treatment of financial planning fees charged to investors where the supply comprised exempt financial services and associated potentially standard- rated services.  “QB 12/07: Goods and Services Tax – Treatment of Transitional Services Supplied as Part of the Sale of a Business (that Includes the Supply of Land)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 65.  “Goods and Services Tax – GST and Retirement Villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015) : 6 (IS 15/02). This statement addresses the GST treatment of taxable supplies of care services and accommodation in a commercial dwelling, and exempt supplies of financial services and accommodation in a non-commercial dwelling. 6 Unclassified 17. The purpose of this Interpretation Statement is to set out the general principles for determining whether a supply of multiple elements (supplied together in a single transaction) is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies and to apply those principles to examples. The Commissioner considers that these general principles are consistent with those set out and applied in the items listed at \[16\]. Analysing supplies involving boundary issues 18. Before reviewing how the courts have analysed boundary issues, it is necessary to consider whether any specific deeming provisions of the Act will apply. 19. The Act contains several provisions that prescribe how supplies must be treated. This means that irrespective of how the supply might be analysed under ordinary principles, the Act overrides this and specifies how the supply will be treated. This occurs, for example, in:  s 5(14B) for rights embedded in shares;  s 5(20) for warranty services provided to a non-resident warrantor; and  s 5(15) for supplies including residences. 20. The application of these sections is discussed briefly in \[21\] to \[28\] below. This list is not exhaustive. Other provisions in the Act may have similar effects. Rights embedded in shares 21. Section 5(14B) was enacted (along with the definition of “associated supply” in s 2 and s 14(1B)) in response to the outcome in CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA) for supplies of equity securities and participatory securities (“shares”). Gulf Harbour is discussed from \[30\]. 22. Section 5(14B) provides that if part of a supply of a share is the supply of a right to receive supplies of goods and services that are not exempt supplies, the supply of the right is treated as being a separate supply. This may mean the right is subject to GST rather than being an exempt financial service. For more information about s 5(14B), see “Goods and Services Tax – GST and Retirement Villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6 (IS 15/02), \[142\]–\[155\]. 23. If elements other than the shares (part of which is the right to receive non- exempt supplies) are supplied under the contract, those other elements must still be considered to determine whether there is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. Warranty services provided to a non-resident warrantor 24. Section 5(20) applies to the supply of services under a warranty covering imported goods. Commonly, two types of warranty cover imported goods:  a factory warranty offered by the non-resident manufacturer to the importer; and  an extended warranty offered by the importer or distributor to the final consumer. 7 Unclassified 25. When the final consumer makes a claim on the warranty, the importer or distributor makes two supplies, namely, a supply of:  goods and services to the final consumer; and  the service of remedying a defect under a factory warranty to the non- resident warrantor (zero-rated under s 11A(1)(ma)), who pays for the supply of that service. 26. Section 5(20) requires the supply of goods and services to the final consumer to be treated as the service of remedying a defect to the non-resident warrantor. It effectively ignores the supply of goods and services to the final consumer. This makes it more likely that the supply of warranty services by the importer or distributor can be zero-rated as a service supplied to a non-resident. For more information about ss 5(20) and 11A(1)(ma), see “Zero-rating of Warranty payments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14 No 11 (November 2002): 71. Supplies including residences 27. Section 5(15) deems a supply that includes a principal place of residence to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. The section also applies to a dwelling that has been rented out by the vendor exclusively for accommodation for at least the preceding five years. For example, when a farm (which includes the farmer’s house and its surrounding curtilage) is sold, s 5(15) provides that the vendor’s supply of the farmer’s house and curtilage is a separate supply from the supply of the remainder of the farm. The GST treatment of each supply is determined separately. Usually, the supply of the remainder of the farm must be zero-rated under s 11(1)(mb) while the supply of the farmer’s house and curtilage is not subject to GST because it is private and does not form part of the vendor’s taxable activity. 28. Once s 5(15) has been applied, the remaining elements (other than the principal place of residence or dwelling) supplied under the contract must still be considered to determine whether there is a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. Whether the supply should be treated as a single composite supply 29. Once any relevant specific deeming provisions have been considered, the next step is to determine the nature of the supply. The approach of the New Zealand courts to identifying what has been supplied is to consider the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA); Gulf Harbour. 30. In Gulf Harbour, the Court of Appeal emphasised the importance of identifying the true nature of the legal arrangements entered into between the supplier and the recipient when determining the GST consequences of a supply. In that case, the taxpayer supplied redeemable preference shares that included membership rights in a golf club (the rights were attached to the shares). The Commissioner argued the supply was of a golf club membership, so was subject to GST. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that there were two supplies: a supply of a share and a supply of a golf club membership. The taxpayer argued that there was a single supply of a GST-exempt financial service (a share). 8 Unclassified 31. The Court of Appeal stated that the Commissioner’s argument (at \[39\]) “involves putting the contractual arrangement to one side and looking at what in substance \[the suppliers\] were supplying ...”. The Court of Appeal considered the Commissioner was incorrectly looking at what “in substance” was being supplied, instead of looking at the contractual arrangement. The Court considered the “true nature” of a transaction must be ascertained by a careful consideration of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out – not by an assessment of the broad substance of the transaction, measured by the results intended and achieved, or of the overall economic consequences. 32. The Court of Appeal held that the golf club membership rights attached to each share were incidents of the share and no independent source or origin of those rights existed. As a result, the Court found for the taxpayer and held that there was a single supply of a share. The Act was subsequently amended in response to this outcome for supplies of equity securities and participatory securities: ss 2 (definition of “associated supply”), 5(14B) and 14(1B). 33. Where it is unclear whether there is one composite supply or multiple separate supplies under the contract, the transaction must be analysed further to determine the issue. Case law has established numerous principles to assist in this enquiry. 34. The leading New Zealand decision considering whether there is a single supply or multiple supplies is the High Court decision in Auckland Institute. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J considered the GST treatment of supplies to international students studying in New Zealand. The taxpayer provided tuition services to students coming to New Zealand from overseas. An associated company provided pre-arrival services. The students paid a single “global fee” to the taxpayer for all supplies from both the taxpayer and the associated company. One of the issues before the Court was whether it was appropriate to split the supply to enable the pre-arrival services to be zero-rated. 35. Hansen J discussed the approach of the House of Lords in Card Protection Plan v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2001\] 2 All ER 143. In that case, the House of Lords considered whether a credit card protection plan offered to cardholders was a single composite supply or two independent supplies comprising the supply of VAT-exempt insurance and a separate supply of VAT-chargeable card registration services. The House of Lords concluded the dominant supply was of VAT-exempt insurance and the supply of the card registration services was ancillary to the exempt supply. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J summarised the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (at \[32\]): • Every supply of a service must normally be regarded as distinct and independent. • A supply which comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split, so as not to distort the functioning of the VAT system. • The essential features of a transaction must be ascertained in order to determine whether the taxable person is supplying the customer, being a typical consumer, with several distinct principal services or with a single service. • There is a single supply in particular in cases where one or more elements are to be regarded as constituting the principal service whilst one or more elements are to be regarded, by contrast, as ancillary services which share the tax treatment of the principal service. A service must be regarded as ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 9 Unclassified • Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 36. After reviewing all the relevant authorities, Hansen J summarised the principles for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (with one or more differing GST treatments) (at \[36\]): \[a\] In determining whether a supply may be apportioned for GST purposes, it is necessary to examine the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to determine whether there is a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion them accordingly. \[b\] The enquiry is to determine whether one element of the transaction (or consideration given) is a necessary or integral part of another or whether it is merely ancillary to or incidental to that other element. \[c\] A service will be ancillary to a principal service if it does not constitute for customers an aim in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal service supplied. 37. Based on these principles, the Commissioner considers it helpful to ask three questions when analysing the transaction:  What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient?  What are the relationships between the elements supplied?  Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 38. When answering these questions, it is important to consider the supply from the perspective of a typical customer. What is the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient? 39. The first question requires a registered person to identify the essential features of the arrangement – the true and substantial nature of what is supplied to the recipient for their payment. In doing so, it is important to examine what is supplied from the point of view of a “typical customer”: Card Protection Plan. In Auckland Institute, Hansen J stated: \[44\] In my view, the attempt to characterise all of the services provided by International as a separate supply is based on a fundamental misconception. It overlooks the need to examine the supply from the point of view of the consumer. It focuses on the arrangements between AIS and International. It fails to consider the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to the consumer. \[45\] The importance of examining the services provided under the contract between the supplier and recipient emerges clearly from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton Ltd v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. ... Richardson J observed at 12,328 that the statutory scheme is directed to contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient of the supply ... \[Emphasis added\] 40. The Commissioner considers that the phrase “the true and substantial nature” does not refer to an “in substance” analysis of the arrangement between the supplier and the recipient. Instead, “the true and substantial nature of the consideration given to the consumer” refers to what the recipient paid for and was supplied with. It requires an examination of the supply from the recipient’s perspective. The true and substantial nature of what is provided to the recipient (the supply or supplies) is determined objectively: British Airways plc v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[1990\] STC 643 (CA). 10 Unclassified 41. The relevant arrangement is the one between the supplier and the recipient. It is irrelevant that the supplier may arrange some other party to deliver the goods or services to the recipient on the supplier’s behalf. This was the view taken in Auckland Institute. In that case, one member of a group of companies contracted with overseas students to provide tuition services. The tuition services were provided to the students by another company in the group. Hansen J concluded that whether a service could be supplied separately (by another entity or a third party) was irrelevant in determining whether a single supply was made. Hansen J focused on the supply actually made under the contract with the recipient – “the true and substantial nature” of what was supplied to the recipient. 42. In this step, the focus is not on what one of the parties subjectively considered the supply was, or could have been. The relevant perspective is to consider what was supplied to the recipient as viewed objectively from the recipient’s perspective. The fact a single price is charged to the recipient does not determine whether one or more than one supply is made. It is the actual supply made to the recipient that must be considered and not how the supply is invoiced or charged. What are the relationships between the elements supplied? 43. It is also helpful to consider the relationships between the different elements supplied. The courts consider whether one element of the transaction is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The phrases “ancillary or incidental to” and “necessary or integral part of” are different descriptions of a similar test: C & E Commrs v United Biscuits (UK) Limited \[1992\] STC 325 (Ct of Sess). The Court in that case noted that one description might be more appropriate for one set of facts and the other for a different set of facts. This view was echoed in College of Estate Management v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2005\] UKHL 62, where the Court noted that the applicable test will depend on the facts of the case. If one element of the transaction is ancillary or integral to another (dominant) element of the transaction, then there will be a single composite supply, with the GST treatment of that supply following the dominant element. 44. Examples of elements that are ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, a dominant element include where the element is:  not an aim in itself; instead the goods or services facilitate, contribute to, or enable the supply of the dominant part;  a means of better enjoying the dominant supply;  an optional extra and not in any real or substantial sense part of the consideration for which a payment is made. 45. In Auckland Institute Hansen J quoted from Customs & Excise Commissioners v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd \[1997\] STC 445 (EWCA) at 462, where Millett LJ noted that the issue is not whether one element is ancillary or incidental to, or even a necessary or integral part of, the whole, but whether one element is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. Hansen J stated (at \[30\]): The issue is not whether one element of a complex commercial transaction is ancillary or incidental to, or even a necessary or integral part of, the whole, but whether one element of the transaction is merely ancillary or incidental to, or a necessary or integral part of, any other element of the transaction. The reason why the former is the wrong question is 11 Unclassified that it leaves the real issue unresolved; whether there is a single or a multiple supply. The proper inquiry is whether one element of the transaction is so dominated by another element as to lose any separate identity as a supply for fiscal purposes, leaving the latter, the dominant element of the transaction, as the only supply. If the elements of the transaction are not in this relationship with each other, each remains as a supply in its own right with its own separate fiscal consequences. \[Emphasis added\] 46. Hansen J held that the pre-arrival services were ancillary or incidental to the principal supply of tuition services. Therefore, the supply of tuition services and pre-arrival services comprised a single supply of tuition services: \[48\] ...They are goods and services provided to enable it (or AIS) to better perform the services supplied to students. Students did not contract for the provision of those services. It may be argued that the students benefited from them but, as Richardson J pointed out in Wilson & Horton, that is not the test. ... \[53\] Notwithstanding the Commissioner's concession that pre-arrival services constitute a separate supply, I am of the view that all of the services provided by International/AIS to students overseas are an integral part of the supply of tuition services. In terms of the fourth of the propositions in the Card Plan Protection case, I would regard those services as not constituting an aim in itself but as a means of better enjoying the principal service. \[Emphasis added\] 47. Hansen J concluded (at \[52\] and \[59\]) that the pre-arrival services were ancillary and integral to the supply of tuition, because they facilitated the students undertaking a course of study. 48. Hansen J borrowed heavily from the United Kingdom VAT cases when deciding whether the pre-arrival services were ancillary or integral to the supply of tuition. Although the categories of goods and services that are exempt or zero-rated under the United Kingdom VAT legislation differ from those under the New Zealand legislation, Hansen J considered the approaches taken in the United Kingdom VAT cases to be of assistance. 49. In College of Estate Management, the College provided a distance-learning course and the necessary written materials to complete the course. The Court considered that the written materials were not ancillary to the provision of the course, but neither was the supply of the written materials an end in itself. Lord Rodger stated: \[10\] ... But, since the court envisages that the principal supply may itself comprise more than one element, plainly, in cases where there is no ancillary supply, a single supply may still be made up of more than one element. So where a taxpayer is involved in a transaction in which he performs several services, none of which can be singled out as the dominant or principal supply, it may nevertheless be necessary to consider whether, for tax purposes, they are properly to be regarded as elements of a single supply. The supply of restaurant services is one example (see Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg C- 231/94 \[1996\] All ER (EC) 656, \[1996\] ECR I-2395). \[11\] ... In the present case, however—leaving aside any allocation of a proportion of the price—it would be highly artificial, to say the least, to describe the printed materials as nothing more than a means for the students the better to enjoy the education supplied by the College. In reality, those materials were the means by which the students obtained most of their education. \[12\] But the mere fact that the supply of the printed materials cannot be described as ancillary does not mean that it is to be regarded as a separate supply for tax purposes. One has still to decide whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the College should properly be regarded as making a separate supply of the printed materials or, rather, a single supply of education, of which the provision of the printed materials is merely one element. ... The question is whether, for tax purposes, these are to be treated as separate supplies or merely as elements in some over-arching single supply. ... \[Emphasis added\] 12 Unclassified 50. Lord Walker stated: \[30\] ... But there are other cases (including the Faaborg case \[C-231/94 Faaborg-Gelting Linien A/S v Finanzamt Flensburg \[1996\] STC 774 (ECJ)\], the Dr Beynon case \[Beynon and Partners v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2004\] UKHL 53\] and the present case) in which it is inappropriate to analyse the transaction in terms of what is ‘principal’ and ‘ancillary’, and it is unhelpful to strain the natural meaning of ‘ancillary’ in an attempt to do so. Food is not ancillary to restaurant services; it is of central and indispensable importance to them; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the Faaborg case). Pharmaceuticals are not ancillary to medical care which requires the use of medication; again, they are of central and indispensable importance; nevertheless there is a single supply of services (see the Dr Beynon case). ... \[32\] ... What the judge called ‘a component part of a single supply’ may be (in the fullest sense) essential to it—a restaurant with no food is almost a contradiction in terms, and could not supply its customers with anything—and yet the economic reality is that the restaurateur provides a single supply of services. Without the need to resort to gnomic utterances such as ‘the medium is the message’, the same sort of relationship exists between the educational services which the College provides to a student who takes one of its distance-learning courses and the written materials which it provides to the student. \[Emphasis added\] 51. The House of Lords considered that the written materials were the means by which the students obtained most of their education. Their Lordships implied that the written materials were of central and indispensable importance to the educational services. The written materials were necessary to complete the course. The Court concluded that the supply of the written materials was part of the overall supply of education services. 52. College of Estate Management was recently distinguished in Metropolitan International Schools v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2015\] UKFTT 517 (TC). In Metropolitan International the Court said (at \[66\]) that “an element that is not an end in itself ranks as an ancillary element. Ancillary elements generally contribute to the better enjoyment of the principal element”. On the facts of Metropolitan International, from a recipient’s point of view, there was a supply of VAT-exempt manuals with a separate supply of optional educational services (which would not lead to any qualification unless the recipient undertook exams with a third party). This can be compared with College of Estate Management, where the facts showed that the overall characteristic of the supply was educational services (leading to a formal qualification) with the additional supply of written materials being part of the supply of the educational services. 53. An example of minor or peripheral parts of a composite supply is seen in Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2007\] EWHC 103 Ch. In this case, it was held there was a single supply of membership of a club that conferred on a child the right to attendance at classes involving structured physical play. Other benefits received on admission to membership (a DVD, a CD, a gym bag, a membership card, personal accident insurance for a child while attending a class, and a subscription for a magazine) were not separate supplies, but were peripheral, and ancillary, to the supply of membership. Briggs J considered that it was “a matter of common sense” that the fee was for membership of the club and not the other benefits of membership (at \[27\]). To conclude otherwise “would be to allow the tail to wag the dog” (at \[29\]). 13 Unclassified Is it reasonable to sever the elements into separate supplies? 54. Finally, it is necessary to consider whether it is reasonable to sever the elements of a transaction into separate supplies. This test requires taking an overall view, without over-zealous dissection, and to look for the essential (or dominant) purpose of the transaction: College of Estate Management (per Lord Walker); Card Protection Plan. A supply that comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split: Card Protection Plan. 55. Similarly, in Auckland Institute, Hansen J cites Tipping J’s judgment in CIR v Smiths City Group Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC). In Smiths City, Tipping J noted (at 9,144) that the Court “must decide as a matter of fact and degree whether there is in the transaction under scrutiny a sufficient distinction between the allegedly different parts to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly”. If, on an objective examination, it is not reasonable to sever the different elements of the transaction, then there will be one composite supply only. 56. It appears from the cases cited above that the “reasonable” test focuses on the essential purpose of the transaction and on the elements themselves (whether there is a sufficient distinction between the elements to make it reasonable to sever them and apportion accordingly) rather than on whether a separate amount is charged for the element in question or on how easily a global fee can be apportioned. 57. Further, one of the principles from Card Protection Plan for determining whether a supply could be separated into multiple supplies (as summarised in Auckland Institute (at \[32\]) is: Even if a single price is charged which may indicate a single supply, it must still be considered whether the arrangements indicated that the customer intended to purchase two distinct services. 58. Hansen J also stated in Auckland Institute (at \[61\]): I do not see the fee structure as a decisive consideration but I think it tends to confirm that the services which the plaintiff claims are covered by the overseas assistance fee are more realistically to be seen as among the costs which AIS incurs in providing tuition services. \[Emphasis added\] 59. Hansen J’s comments relate to an argument by the Commissioner that as there was no material difference between the fees charged to domestic and overseas students, the fee structure confirmed that a separate supply of overseas assistance services was not made to students. Hansen J did not consider that the fee structure was determinative. 60. And in Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications Plc \[1999\] BTC 5,273 (which was cited in Auckland Institute of Studies) Lord Slynn said: On the authorities it is clear that the fact that one ‘package price’ is charged without separate charge for individual supplies being specified does not prevent there being two separate supplies for VAT purposes. In my opinion the fact that separate charges are identified in a contract or on an invoice does not on a consideration of all the circumstances necessarily prevent the various supplies from constituting one composite transaction nor does it prevent one supply from being ancillary to another supply which for VAT purposes is the dominant supply. Even though it may be desirable to approach each supply as if it were a separate supply and even though each supply in a composite transaction may be an independent separate 14 Unclassified supply the essential features of a transaction may show that one supply is ancillary to another and that it is the latter that for VAT purposes is to be treated as the supply. \[Emphasis added\] 61. Lord Hope (also in British Telecommunications) similarly considered that in all cases the essential features of the transaction must be identified. All the circumstances of the transaction must be considered and no one factor will determine whether there is a separate supply. Whether a separate charge is made or whether a separate price can be identified, whether the service could be supplied separately or whether the supplies are “physically and economically dissociable” (for example, where there is a supply of goods and a supply of services and the price for each supply can be identified) are not determinative. GST treatment of a single composite supply 62. If it is determined that there is a single composite supply, it is still necessary to determine whether there are any other specific provisions in the Act that may apply. For example, the following matters need to be considered. Some supplies of land must be zero-rated 63. The first is whether the single composite supply includes land and must be zero- rated. Section 11(1)(mb) provides that a supply that wholly or partly consists of land must be zero-rated if at settlement date:  the supply is made by a vendor who is a registered person to a purchaser who is a registered person;  the purchaser acquires the goods (including land) supplied with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and  the land included in the supply is not intended to be used as the purchaser’s principal place of residence or the principal place of residence of a relative of the purchaser. 64. If s 11(1)(mb) applies, the single composite supply must be zero–rated, regardless of whether the land is the dominant element of the supply. Other supplies may be partly zero-rated 65. Sections 11, 11A, 11AB and 11B provide that some taxable supplies must be zero-rated. While all the zero-rating provisions apply to “a supply”, some indicate that part of the supply can be zero-rated by using the words “to the extent that” or other equivalent wording. Where a provision of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B requires part of a supply to be zero-rated, the different elements of a single composite supply may be subject to different GST treatments. 66. These different GST treatments are achieved through s 5(14). Section 5(14) applies when a supply is subject to GST at the standard rate but any of the provisions of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B require part of the supply to be zero-rated. If s 5(14) applies, the zero-rated part is treated as being a separate supply. For a more detailed discussion of s 5(14), see “IS 08/01: GST — Role of section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in Regard to the Zero-rating of Part of a Supply” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8. 15 Unclassified Otherwise, GST treatment follows dominant element 67. If the provisions of ss 11, 11A, 11AB or 11B do not apply to the single composite supply, the GST treatment of that supply will follow the dominant element of the supply. If there is no dominant element (for example, the supply is made up of several equally important elements that are integral to each other), the GST treatment will be determined by the overall characteristics of the single composite supply. GST treatment of multiple separate supplies 68. If there are multiple separate supplies, the relevant provisions of the Act are applied to each supply. This means that it is necessary to consider each separately identified supply to determine whether any of the specific provisions (such as, for example, s 11(1)(mb)) apply. 69. In some situations, a recipient may pay a global amount for multiple supplies with different GST treatments (for example, taxable supplies and exempt supplies). Section 10(18) provides that GST should be calculated on that part of the consideration that is properly attributable to the taxable supply. This means the consideration must be apportioned between taxable supplies and non-taxable supplies or exempt supplies. Examples 70. The following examples illustrate how the law applies. All persons mentioned in the examples are GST registered. Example 1 – Services supplied to overseas students to help them to move to New Zealand 71. Ecological Education Ltd offers education services to students in New Zealand. The education services are intended to provide students with a qualification in eco-management. Almost all of Ecological Education’s students are from overseas. To help students moving to New Zealand, Ecological Education provides various pre-arrival services to the students while they are still overseas (for example, interpreting and translating services, assistance with immigration procedures and the completion of enrolment applications). Ecological Education charges the student a single fee for the tuition costs and the pre-arrival services. Are the pre-arrival services separate zero-rated supplies? 72. No. The pre-arrival services are part of a single composite supply of standard- rated education services, so are also standard-rated. 73. First, it is necessary to identify the supply by considering the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out by the supplier and the recipient in light of the surrounding circumstances. It is evident from the arrangement that Ecological Education supplies multiple elements, namely education services to the students in New Zealand, and various pre-arrival services to students while they are still overseas, all for a single fee. 74. To decide whether Ecological Education has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies it is helpful to consider the true and substantive nature of what is supplied to the student from the recipient’s (that is, the student’s) 16 Unclassified perspective. From the student’s point of view, the dominant supply is of education services. Considering the relationship between the elements supplied, the pre-arrival services are ancillary or incidental to the supply of education services. The pre-arrival services are not aims in themselves, but are a means of better enjoying the education services. Accordingly, there is a single composite supply of education services that is subject to GST at the standard rate. Example 2 – Tablet provided as part of mortgage promotion 75. Andrew needs to obtain a mortgage of $250,000 to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches New Bank, because of its recent mortgage promotion. He gets his mortgage approved and, as part of the mortgage promotion, he receives a new tablet. 76. If these were separate supplies, the mortgage would be an exempt supply of financial services under s 14(1)(a). The supply of the tablet would be a taxable supply under s 8. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST? 77. No. The tablet is an incidental part of a single composite, exempt supply of the mortgage, so is also exempt from GST. 78. The true nature of the legal arrangement is a loan from New Bank to Andrew (secured by a mortgage over the land). The contract also includes a supply of goods from New Bank to Andrew. Therefore, New Bank supplies multiple elements to Andrew, namely a loan and a tablet. The question is whether these two elements are a single composite supply or multiple separate supplies. As with example 1, the nature of the supply has to be considered from the recipient’s (that is, Andrew’s) perspective. 79. Unlike example 1, the supply of the tablet cannot be considered ancillary to the supply of financial services, because it does not facilitate, contribute to or enable the supply of the dominant part of the transaction (the mortgage). The supply of the tablet does not directly affect the supply of the mortgage in any material sense. 80. However, the supply of the tablet is incidental, minor or peripheral to the dominant element of the supply. Andrew would not have entered into a mortgage simply to receive the tablet. Obtaining the tablet is not an aim in itself. Andrew’s aim is to obtain a mortgage. Objectively, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. The supply of the tablet is also not sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the parts. It is the supply of the mortgage that triggers the supply of the tablet. 81. In this situation, there is a single composite, exempt supply of a mortgage. The supply of the tablet is an incidental or peripheral supply to the dominant supply of GST-exempt financial services. This means all elements of the supply under the agreement are exempt for GST. Example 3 – Tablet available at reduced price as part of mortgage promotion 82. As a variation to the facts of example 2, Andrew still needs to obtain a mortgage to purchase land for the expansion of his manufacturing business. He approaches 17 Unclassified New Bank, because of its recent mortgage promotion. New Bank’s mortgage promotion is that for new borrowings in the range of what Andrew wants to borrow, it is offering customers the opportunity to purchase for $500 a new tablet valued at $1,500. Andrew’s mortgage is approved and, as part of the mortgage promotion, he takes up the opportunity to get a new tablet for $500. Is the supply of the tablet subject to GST? 83. Yes. The supply of the tablet is separate to the supply of the mortgage. Therefore, although the mortgage is exempt as the supply of financial services, the tablet is a taxable supply. 84. Unlike example 2, the tablet is not incidental to taking out the mortgage. Obtaining the tablet was an aim in itself. While Andrew’s primary aim was to obtain a mortgage, obtaining the new tablet was a separate objective. As in example 2, the supply of the tablet does not change or facilitate the dominant element, which is the mortgage. However, in this case the supply of the tablet is sufficiently distinct from the supply of the mortgage to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the elements. The tablet was not part of the supply of the mortgage – it was separately pursued by Andrew for further consideration. Example 4 – Theatre tickets purchased on credit card and credit card surcharge 85. To celebrate the expansion of his business, Andrew buys theatre tickets for all his employees. Andrew purchases the tickets from the theatre box office using his credit card. The theatre charges Andrew a credit card surcharge. Is the credit card surcharge a separate exempt supply of financial services? 86. No. The credit card surcharge is part of a single composite supply of standard rated theatre tickets. 87. The true nature of the legal arrangement is for the supply of multiple elements, namely theatre tickets and the facility to pay for those tickets by credit card, with each element itemised and charged for separately. It is necessary to consider whether there is any relationship between the supply of the tickets and the supply of the financial service (being the facility to pay with a credit card). Viewing the arrangement between Andrew and the theatre from Andrew’s point of view, the dominant supply is the supply of theatre tickets. While he is paying a surcharge for using his credit card, the dominant supply remains the supply of theatre tickets. Andrew’s ability to use his credit card is not an aim in itself. The facility to pay by credit card is ancillary to the dominant supply of the theatre tickets, in the sense that it enables the supply to occur. 88. There is a single composite, taxable supply of theatre tickets. This means all the elements of the supply under the agreement are subject to GST. Example 5 – Residential accommodation and cleaning services 89. Andrew’s parents are looking to move into a villa that is part of a retirement complex. The villa stands alone and, at this stage, Andrew’s parents do not require any care. When considering the options, Andrew convinces his parents that they should get the option offered by the retirement complex of having a cleaner come to the villa weekly. 18 Unclassified 90. If these are separate supplies, the supply of the right to live in the villa would be an exempt supply of residential accommodation under s 14(1)(c). The supply of the cleaning services would be a taxable supply under s 8. Are the cleaning services subject to GST? 91. Yes. The cleaning services are a separate supply to the supply of the right to live in the villa. 92. The dominant supply is the right to live in the villa. In some respects, the cleaning services could be seen as ancillary or incidental to the right to live in the villa. However, in this case, the cleaning services are not necessary or incidental to the right to live in the villa – they are an extra service that not all recipients require. In this case, a separate amount is charged for the cleaning services. This fact may indicate multiple separate supplies, but it is not determinative. It must still be considered whether the arrangements indicate that Andrew’s parents intended to purchase two distinct services. While Andrew’s parents’ primary aim was to obtain the right to live in the villa, obtaining the cleaning services was a separate objective. In this case the supply of the cleaning services is sufficiently distinct from the supply of the right to live in the villa to make it reasonable to sever and apportion the elements. Example 6 – Loyalty points with a credit card 93. Electronics Ltd (an electronics retail chain) operates a customer loyalty programme in its retail stores. Registered customers receive loyalty points for shopping at Electronics Ltd and these loyalty points entitle them to future discounts at Electronics Ltd. 94. New Bank wants to expand its credit card business. It decides to enter into an arrangement with Electronics Ltd. Under the terms of the arrangement, New Bank and Electronics Ltd intend to provide additional loyalty points in Electronics Ltd’s loyalty programme to registered customers who use the New Bank credit card to purchase goods from Electronics Ltd. 95. New Bank pays Electronics Ltd for services associated with promoting and maintaining the loyalty programme. These services include access to Electronics Ltd’s customer database, marketing the loyalty programme (including the provision of all marketing material), encouraging customers to use the New Bank credit card, managing all non-credit card aspects of the loyalty programme, accepting in-store account payments, assisting the retail stores to accept in-store account payments and provide loyalty points, and training the retail store employees on how the loyalty programme works. 96. Electronics Ltd wants to know how it should treat the services it supplies to New Bank for GST purposes. Should any of the services be exempt as a separate supply of financial services? 97. No. The services are all part of a single composite supply of standard-rated marketing and promotional services. 98. The contract between New Bank and Electronics Ltd provides for the supply of several services from Electronics Ltd to New Bank. It is necessary to consider whether there is any relationship between the various services provided. The 19 Unclassified focus must be on what is supplied to the recipient. The recipient of these services is New Bank, despite the fact some of the services are supplied directly to New Bank’s customers (for example, answering questions about the loyalty programme). 99. The supply could be broken down into separate elements (some taxable at the standard rate and some exempt). However, this would not appropriately reflect what is supplied to the recipient, New Bank. The supply from Electronics Ltd to New Bank is a supply of all the elements. From New Bank’s perspective, it has contracted with Electronics Ltd for the supply of all those elements as a single package of marketing and promotional services. It is helpful to consider the relationship between the different elements of the supply when deciding whether Electronics Ltd has made one composite supply or multiple separate supplies to New Bank. 100. The dominant element of the supply to New Bank is marketing and promotional services for the loyalty programme. While Electronics Ltd may, as part of that dominant element, be providing financial services, such as accepting account payments, these are ancillary to the dominant element when packaged together. This is because these parts of the supply are not aims in themselves. They are included so that New Bank can better enjoy the dominant element of the supply of marketing and promotional services. It is also helpful to consider the essential purpose of the transaction between New Bank and Electronics Ltd, namely, the provision of a single package of marketing and promotional services. It would not be reasonable to sever the elements of the transaction into separate supplies. 101. In this situation there is a single composite, taxable supply of marketing and promotional services. The GST treatment of the dominant element of the supply (marketing and promotional services) is a taxable supply at the standard rate. Therefore, the ancillary or incidental supplies are also taxable at the standard rate. Example 7 – Treatment of transitional services supplied as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) 102. “QB 12/07: Goods and Services Tax – Treatment of Transitional Services Supplied as Part of the Sale of a Business (that Includes the Supply of Land)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 65 provides an example of the application of the principles set out in this Interpretation Statement. 103. QB 12/07 considers whether transitional services provided by the vendor as part of the sale of a business (that includes the supply of land) will be part of a single composite supply and therefore zero-rated for GST purposes where:  the services and the sale of the business form part of the same contractual arrangement, and  the services are not provided for a separately identifiable consideration. 104. The examples consider two fact scenarios. The first scenario is where the vendor provides basic transitional services as part of the sale of the business. The vendor agrees to be onsite for a week from the day of transfer to show the purchaser how the business operates, to answer any questions that the purchaser has and to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business. 20 Unclassified 105. In this situation there is a single composite, zero-rated supply of a business that includes land. The dominant element of the agreement is the supply of the business (including land). The services are not extensive and are provided for only a short period of time. Further, the nature of the services is to facilitate a smooth transfer of the business to the purchaser. Consequently, the services provided are ancillary and incidental to the supply of the business. They do not constitute an aim in themselves, but rather are a means for the purchaser to better enjoy the supply of the business. 106. The second scenario is where the vendor provides extensive transitional services as part of the sale of the business. The vendor agrees to manage the business for the purchaser for an initial period of 12 months. 107. In this situation there are two separate supplies - one of the land/business and one of transitional services. The transitional services are relatively extensive and are provided over a 12 month period. They are an aim in themselves for the purchaser who requires someone to run the business on an on-going basis. The fact that the services are not provided for a separately identifiable consideration is not determinative. The supply of these transitional services should be standard-rated, as ss 11(1)(mb) and 5(24) do not apply. 108. As noted in the example, no amount of consideration has been attributed to the transitional services. Therefore, the total consideration provided for under the agreement will need to be apportioned between the zero-rated supply (the business/land) and the standard-rated supply (the transitional services). 109. The Commissioner considers that these outcomes are consistent with the general principles set out and applied in this Interpretation Statement. 21 Unclassified References Related rulings/statements “Financial Planning Fees – GST Treatment” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 7 (July 2001): 37 (IS 0079) “Goods and Services Tax - GST and Retirement Villages” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 11 (December 2015): 6 (IS 15/02) “IS 08/01: GST — Role of Section 5(14) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in Regard to the Zero-rating of Part of a Supply” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 5 (June 2008): 8 “QB 12/07: Goods and Services Tax – Treatment of Transitional Services Supplied as Part of the Sale of a Business (that Includes the Supply of Land)” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 6 (July 2012): 65 “Zero-rating of Warranty Payments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002): 71 Subject references Apportionment GST Multiple supplies Single supply Legislative references Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, ss 5, 8, 10, 11, 11A, 11AB, 11B, 14 Case references Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) British Airways plc v C & E Commrs \[1990\] STC 643 (CA) Card Protection Plan v C & E Commrs \[2001\] 2 All ER 143 (HL) CIR v Gulf Harbour Development Ltd (2004) 21 NZTC 18,915 (CA) CIR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140 (HC) College of Estate Management v Customs & Excise Commissioners \[2005\] UKHL 62, 4 All ER 933 Customs & Excise Commissioners v British Telecommunications Plc \[1999\] BTC 5,273 Customs & Excise Commissioners v United Biscuits (UK) Limited \[1992\] STC 325 Customs & Excise Commissioners v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd \[1997\] STC 445 (EWCA) Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086 (CA) Metropolitan International Schools v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2015\] UKFTT 517 (TC) Tumble Tots (UK) Ltd v Revenue & Customs Commissioners \[2007\] EWHC 103 Ch 22 Unclassified Appendix – Legislation Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 1.

(5) The Commissioner may extend the 28-day period before a supply of goods is charged with tax at the rate specified in section 8 if the Commissioner has determined, after the supplier has applied, that— (a) circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and the recipient have prevented, or will prevent, the export of the goods within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply; or (b) due to the nature of the supply, it is not practicable for the supplier to export the goods, or a class of the goods, within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply. (6) If subsection (1)(g) applies and the goods cannot be evidenced, as specified by the chief executive of the New Zealand Customs Service in accordance with the sealed bag system, as being exported within 28 days beginning on the day of the time of supply, despite subsection (1)(g), the supply must be charged with tax at the rate specified in section 8. (7) Subsection (1)(i) applies to the supply of a boat or an aircraft, if— (a) the boat or aircraft is exported within 60 days beginning on the date on which the recipient or the recipient’s agent takes physical possession of it, or within a longer period as the Commissioner may allow under subsection (8); and (b) the vendor or the purchaser provides the Commissioner with such documentation and undertakings as the Commissioner may require in relation to— (i) records of the sale of the supply; and (ii) limitations on dealings in and the uses to which the boat or aircraft will be put before export; and (iii) the proposed and actual date of export. (8) The Commissioner may extend the 60-day period if the Commissioner is satisfied, upon the application of the supplier, that circumstances beyond the control of the supplier and the recipient have prevented, or will prevent, the export of the boat or aircraft within the period. (8B) Whether a supply of goods is zero-rated under subsection (1)(mb) is determined at the time of settlement of the transaction relating to the supply.
