International treaty examination of taxation agreements with the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Chile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of the Philippines, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the following double taxation agreements: • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol • Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income • Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 • Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 2 • Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 • Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims. We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.

International treaty examination of taxation agreements with the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Chile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of the Philippines, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the following double taxation agreements: • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol • Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income • Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 • Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 2 • Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 • Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims. We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.

International treaty examination of taxation agreements with the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Chile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of the Philippines, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the following double taxation agreements: • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol • Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income • Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 • Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 2 • Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 • Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims. We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.

International treaty examination of taxation agreements with the Republic of South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Chile, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Republic of the Philippines, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the following double taxation agreements: • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income • Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol • Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income • Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 • Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 2 • Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 • Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims. We have no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The National Interest Analyses for these treaties are appended to this report. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 3 Appendix A Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA) with South Africa on 6 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and South Africa, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The DTA with South Africa will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. Where both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 4 The level of trade is one factor in deciding with which country to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to South Africa amounted to $129mil and $101.7mil respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with South Africa is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 5 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. The DTA with South Africa will bring to 28 the number of DTAs in our tax treaty network with our major trade and investment partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 4 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 6 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and the Republic of South Africa – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will reduce withholding taxes on interest, dividends and royalties to 10%, 15% and 10% respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange information relating to taxes, and will. 7 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the allocation of taxing rights to South Africa under the DTA. However, since taxing rights are allocated on a reciprocal basis the overall effect of the DTA is likely to be revenue neutral. The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to South Africa under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive. 8 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with South Africa. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 9 A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. 10 Under domestic law New Zealand taxes its tax residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. South Africa has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and South Africa. Under this DTA, New Zealand and South Africa will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 5 • Business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various specific rules applicable in specific situations. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country resident may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 6 • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of South Africa (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22 and 24 of the DTA refer.\]. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 11 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 12 It is possible that the DTA may result in some cost to New Zealand, in terms of revenue forgone, but if so this will be very minor given that the DTA has been negotiated on a reciprocal basis. Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 7 Appendix B Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and Protocol (the DTA) with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 22 September 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to Become a Party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs also assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 The negotiation of a DTA with the UAE is unusual on one level because the UAE does not have a general income tax system and, therefore, double taxation does not generally arise in cross border transactions between New Zealand and the UAE. The UAE has, however, indicated that it may introduce a general income tax system at some stage in the future. 5 The main rationale for the DTA with the United Arab Emirates is to facilitate investment from the UAE into New Zealand. Due to the absence of a general income tax in the UAE against which New Zealand taxes would otherwise be credited, UAE investors will seek to receive the same after tax rate of return from New Zealand as they can earn elsewhere, including from countries that impose no tax on their investments. Consequently the imposition of full domestic New Zealand tax on UAE investments will, in many cases, result in the UAE investor requiring a rate of return from New Zealand investments which is grossed-up by the amount of New Zealand tax. In essence, UAE INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 8 investors are sensitive to New Zealand taxes and the imposition of New Zealand tax on the UAE investor could result in the UAE financing fewer projects in New Zealand. Further, where a higher rate of return is demanded than in the absence of tax, the tax cost would likely be borne by New Zealand factors of production, from whom it would be more efficient to collect the tax directly. Accordingly, this treaty relieves tax on UAE investments in accordance with New Zealand’s treaty policy. In particular, UAE investors are likely to be less sensitive to tax on investments which can only be undertaken in New Zealand and the DTA generally retains full taxing rights over investments of this nature. 6 The UAE Government’s main investment arm, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), has significant investments overseas (in excess of US$400 billion). Similarly the Dubai Investment and Development Authority (DIDA) has significant overseas investments, and the UAE private sector is understood to have in the vicinity of US $600 billion available for investors. The UAE government has indicated that it is keen to diversify its investment portfolio into New Zealand as well as increase bilateral trade, joint ventures and education. However, the UAE emphasised that a DTA was a basic pre- requisite for any investment from the UAE due to UAE investors’ sensitivity to New Zealand tax. 7 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. The level of imports from and exports to the UAE amounted to $357,068,000 and $108,760,000 respectively for the year ended June 2003. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 8 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand. It follows the standard format of our other DTAs such that New Zealand enterprises dealing with the UAE will be subject to familiar rules. Although the problem of double taxation does not generally arise with the UAE, the significant level of trade between our two countries makes it important that residents of both countries have the comfort of certainty of tax treatment and the benefit of a mutual agreement procedure should they experience taxation difficulties. 9 The main advantage for New Zealand, however, is that the DTA opens up significant opportunities for foreign investment into New Zealand from the UAE. The UAE Government has made it clear that they are willing to look at investing into New Zealand provided a DTA is in place to provide relief from New Zealand taxes. Private sector investment from the UAE into New Zealand also has the potential to increase significantly, given the reduction of withholding tax rates under the DTA. 10 The DTA also advantages New Zealand in that it opens up other opportunities for the UAE to strengthen their relationship with New Zealand, particularly as the UAE have consistently noted that they see New Zealand as a safe, politically stable country. The negotiation of a DTA was a major factor in the decision of the UAE airline Emirates to commence a service to New Zealand. Further it is likely that the DTA will pave the way for fee-paying students to come to New Zealand to study at New Zealand educational institutions. 11 The ability to exchange information with the UAE will also be an advantage for New Zealand, as this will assist in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 9 12 The disadvantage of the DTA is that by allocating taxing rights between the two countries, New Zealand may forego revenue on any existing UAE investments. However, as mentioned in the discussion of the revenue implications of the DTA under the heading "Costs”, UAE investment in New Zealand is likely to be neligible in the absence of a DTA. 13 A detailed aspect of this DTA is that it provides in the Protocol that the Contracting States recognise that sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Governments of both countries, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. This provision clarifies that the DTA recognises and protects (but does not extend), the sovereign immunity doctrine that New Zealand applies to all countries. 14 Consistent with international norms, a restrictive doctrine of sovereign immunity operates in New Zealand. Under this doctrine immunity from judicial suit is provided only in respect of Government acts of a Government nature. It does not provide immunity for Government acts of a commercial nature. Therefore, if the UAE Government enters a transaction of a type that is open to a private citizen the act will be considered commercial or private in nature and sovereign immunity will not apply. 15 Any transactions falling outside the ambit of sovereign immunity will be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with the terms of the articles in the treaty. There is provision for special relief for Government and certain Government owned entities in these articles. Under paragraph 9 of the Protocol the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions that form an integral part of the UAE. 16 On balance, New Zealand stands to gain significant foreign direct investment from the implementation of the DTA and therefore, it is considered that it is in New Zealand’s interests to enter into the DTA. Obligations 17 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the treaty and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 18 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. The UAE has a limited income tax system for oil companies and foreign owned banks. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and the UAE. Under this DTA, New Zealand and the UAE will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income and profits from hydrocarbons situated in the UAE will remain subject to the domestic laws and regulations of the UAE. \[Article 3 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from immovable property will generally remain taxable in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 10 • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless the profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment is essentially a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 9 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent. In cases where the Government of a country or a Government owned financial institution derives interest from the other country, the country in which the interest arises cannot impose any tax. Paragraph 9 of the Protocol clarifies that the ADIA and DIDA are recognised as being an integral part of the Government for these purposes. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of movable property the gains are generally taxable in the country in which the alienator is resident. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for more than 183 days and certain other conditions are met. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country in which the company is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson take place. The country in which the activities take place cannot impose tax if the entertainer or sportsperson is sponsored by the Government of the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions and annuities are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. Government pensions are in limited circumstances taxable in both States. \[Articles 19 and 20 of the DTA refer.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 11 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 20 of the DTA refers.\] • Students from one country who study in the other country are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. However a person can only benefit from this for five fiscal years. \[Article 21 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 23 , 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] • Sovereign immunity from income tax is provided to the Government of the United Arab Emirates, including agencies that form an integral part of the Government. In essence, this means that transactions in New Zealand by the United Arab Emirates Government or its agencies that are of a ‘government’ rather than a commercial nature are exempt from income tax. \[Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and the Dubai Investment and Development Authority are recognised as government institutions by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. \[Paragraph 1 of the Protocol and Paragraph 9 of the Protocol refers.\] • The provision in the DTA that refers to Income from Employment shall apply from the 27 October 2002. \[Paragraph 11 of the Protocol refers.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 19 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 20 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and the UAE which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of the UAE residents in New Zealand which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of the UAE in respect of which, the DTA will lower withholding rates. This could result in a revenue loss in relation to revenue collected on any existing investment from the UAE. The extent of this revenue cost, if any, depends on whether significant investment activity would take place in New Zealand in the absence of a DTA. Discussions with the UAE indicate that this would be unlikely. However, if as a result of the new DTA, UAE investment in New Zealand increases significantly, the revenue collected on that new investment together with the economic benefits associated with the new investment, will outweigh any such revenue cost. Future Protocols 21 No future protocols are anticipated. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 12 Implementation 22 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 23 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 24 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 25 Article 28 of the DTA provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 13 Appendix C Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Finance and Revenue signed the Convention Between New Zealand and the Republic of Chile for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Protocol to the Convention between the Republic of Chile and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) on 10 December 2003. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Chile, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to \[complete\] 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Chile were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American Strategy, and the DTA represents our first with that region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Chile as our highest priority in Latin America. 4 The DTA with Chile will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 14 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Chile amounted to $31.0m and $32.8m respectively for the year ended June 2003. The extent of trade with Chile is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Chile – in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 %, 15 % and 10 % respectively (but see below on these withholding rates), and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. Where both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand will forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Chile under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Chilean tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 A feature that is unique to this DTA is the taxation of dividends. Dividends from one State paid to a resident of the other State may be taxed by both States. The DTA provides that the tax payable in the source State is limited to 15 per cent of the gross amount of dividends. This limitation applies only to New Zealand and not to Chile – which is an unusual feature of this DTA. Usually the limitation on source taxing rights is reciprocal, but this was not possible in the case of Chile because of Chile’s company tax system. Chile has a low (15 %) company tax rate but a high (35 per cent) withholding tax on distributions. The company tax is then credited against the withholding tax to reduce the total tax burden to 35 % under the DTA. New Zealand will impose a 33 % company tax and 15 % withholding tax on distributions. Generally, however, the total New Zealand tax burden will not exceed 33 % because of the application of our Foreign Investor Tax Credit rules which reduce the company tax rate by an amount equal to the withholding tax. 10 As the total tax impost in each country in respect of company profits and distributions is broadly similar – New Zealand 33 % and Chile 35 % – the absence of reciprocity in the DTA is not as inequitable as it may seem on the face of it. Other countries negotiating with Chile have reached accommodation on this issue in a variety of ways. However, New Zealand’s preference is to revert to a reciprocal formulation in the DTA if Chile moves to a company tax system that is similar to our own. The DTA contains a review clause to INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 15 ensure that if Chile makes any changes to its taxation of company profits or distributions, that render the DTA inequitable, the two sides will re-enter negotiations with the aim of restoring an appropriate balance. 11 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Chile under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 27 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests.) 12 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Chile. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 13 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 14 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Chile has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Chile. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Chile will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country, except in the case of ‘cabotage’ (carriage within New Zealand) which is taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. New Zealand may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 per cent on the gross amount of the dividends if it is the source country. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers. Please also refer to the discussion on this issue above under the heading Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty entering into Force.\] INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 16 • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent on interest granted by loans from banks and insurance companies and 15 per cent in all other cases. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 per cent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gains are generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Chile (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 23, 24 and 25 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 15 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 16 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Chile which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 17 forgone in relation to the short-term activities of Chilean residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone in relation to dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Chile, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Chile will also be similarly constrained from taxing income flows from Chile to New Zealand, and this reduced Chilean tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction of creditable Chilean taxes, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future Protocols 17 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 18 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 19 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 20 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with private sector firms was undertaken before and during negotiations. Withdrawal or Denunciation 21 Article 29 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 18 Appendix D Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom signed the Protocol between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to amend the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Gains, signed at London on 4 August 1983 (the Protocol) on 4 November 2003. Following the completion of the international treaty examination process, the Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK), in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 27 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 2 3 The Protocol amends a DTA which New Zealand already has with the UK that came into force in December 1983 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and on capital gains (the DTA). 4 Negotiations for a protocol were initiated by New Zealand following advice from the UK that it had modified its position on the exchange of information to allow it to use its information gathering powers to obtain information requested by its DTA partners where there was no domestic tax interest (i.e. where no UK tax was also at stake). Before this change of policy, New Zealand was unable to obtain full information, in all cases, from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. The change in UK domestic law now ensures that information requested by New Zealand can be obtained without the need for a UK tax interest. However, the wording of the exchange of information provision in our DTA with the UK needed to be updated before we could take advantage of this new position. New Zealand already exchanges full information with all our DTA partners. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 19 5 The UK also wished to amend the DTA in order to address concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to utilise the DTA to avoid UK capital gains tax. This is done by amending the article on the “alienation of property”. 6 The opportunity was also taken to make certain other minor amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with developments in New Zealand, the UK and the OECD. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 7 The primary advantage of the Protocol is that it ensures that New Zealand tax authorities will now be able to obtain full information from the UK to assist with audits of New Zealand taxpayers. This will significantly reduce the ability of New Zealand taxpayers to avoid or evade New Zealand tax on income sourced from the UK. 8 The anti-avoidance provisions in the “Dividends”, “Interest” and “Royalties” articles will help eliminate abuse of the DTA. 9 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 10 The Protocol ensures that New Zealand retains the right to tax income from insurance according to our domestic law provisions. This is an important New Zealand anti- avoidance provision designed to prevent the non-residents from otherwise using the DTA to recharacterise profits as insurance premiums and distribute them offshore free of New Zealand tax. 11 All these provisions are advantageous to New Zealand. The Protocol does not have any disadvantages for New Zealand. The other articles in the Protocol relate specifically to UK taxpayers. The change to the “Dividends” article ensures that the DTA remains relevant to the way the UK now taxes dividends. The changes to the “Alienation of Property” article are to prevent UK taxpayers avoiding UK capital gains tax on the sale of property. Obligations 12 The Protocol will not impose requirements on taxpayers. The only obligations of a DTA are on the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Protocol modifies these DTA obligations as follows: INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 20 • Article 1 of the Protocol inserts a new paragraph 6 in Article 8 of the DTA concerning the taxation of cross border insurance premiums. Like the previous paragraph 6 the new paragraph allows New Zealand and the UK to tax income from insurance premiums under our domestic law. However, for insurance premiums (other than life insurance) paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other country, other than through a permanent establishment such as a branch, that other country can tax only 10% of the income derived from such premiums. This provision reflects the New Zealand domestic legislation. • Article 2 of the Protocol deletes the current “Dividends” article (Article 11) and replaces it with a new one based on the standard OECD formulation. Paragraph 1 gives a taxing right to the country of residence of the person receiving the dividends. Paragraph 2 also entitles the country from which the dividends are paid to tax the dividends although this taxing right is generally limited to 15% of the gross amount of the dividends. Paragraph 3 defines the dividends to which the article applies as meaning income from shares and similar income. Paragraph 4 provides that paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the owner of the dividends carries on business in the country from which the dividends are paid through a permanent establishment or a fixed base. Paragraph 5 prohibits extra-territorial taxation of dividends paid by a company which derives income from the other country. Paragraph 6 is the new anti- abuse provision to prevent the use of the DTA to avoid tax by taking advantage of the reduced withholding rates on dividends under the DTA. This paragraph is not in the standard OECD formulation although it is suggested in the commentary to the OECD Model Tax Convention. • Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol are the same as paragraph 6 of Article 2. They are to prevent the use of reduced withholding rates in the interest and royalties articles of the DTA to avoid tax. • Article 5 deletes paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Alienation of Property in the DTA (Article 14) and inserts new paragraphs 1, 4 and 5. New paragraph 1 extends the rule dealing with income from the alienation of ‘immovable property’ (e.g. land and buildings) to include income from the alienation of shares deriving the greater part of their value from such property. This is primarily an anti-avoidance rule designed to ensure that a country does not lose taxing rights over its real property just because the shares in a company owning the property are sold rather than the property itself. New paragraph 4 corrects a typographical error in the old paragraph 4 of the Article by inserting the word ‘only’. An additional rule, paragraph 5, has been included to deal with the UK concerns over UK avoidance schemes designed to avoid UK capital gains tax by the alienator of the property becoming resident in New Zealand for the purposes of selling the property. The application of this provision is limited specifically to UK taxpayers. It ensures that, notwithstanding the rest of the article, the UK can levy capital gains tax on a person who is a UK resident during the year the property was alienated or at any time during the 6 years preceding that year. • Article 6 of the Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 21 • Article 7 of the Protocol deletes the existing Exchange of Information Article (Article 25) and replaces it with a new version which reflects the change in UK domestic law. Previously, the UK had only been able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents held by banks and other persons if it was able to demonstrate to an independent tribunal that UK tax was at stake. Until now, this has meant that the domestic ‘third party’ information powers have not always been available to assist in complying with requests for information made under its DTAs (including its DTA with New Zealand). This position was changed in the UK Finance Act 2000. The UK will now be able to use its ‘third party’ information powers to obtain or inspect documents, including those held by banks, in order to respond to specific requests made under exchange of information provisions contained in DTAs or Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs). These powers may only be used if the DTA or TIEA in question specifically requires information to be obtained as well as disclosed for exchange of information purposes. The new Article 25 includes this requirement and so will enable New Zealand to take advantage of this change in UK domestic legislation. • Article 8 of the protocol sets out when the provisions of the Protocol will apply from. As the UK were anxious to address their avoidance issues Article 5 applies from the date of signature of the Protocol. Similarly, Article 7 of the protocol will apply from the date of signature ensuring it will apply to all information exchanged or requested after this date (including tax matters relating to a time prior to signature). The rest of the Protocol will apply (in the case of New Zealand) from the first day of April following the entry into force of the Protocol. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects will be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 There should be no revenue, administrative or compliance costs for New Zealand arising from the protocol. The UK will collect more tax as a result of closing down the loophole for avoiding capital gains tax. However, this is not revenue that New Zealand would have collected because we do not tax these gains under our domestic law. The UK may also have some collateral administrative costs associated with their broader obligations to exchange information that arise as a result of this protocol. There is no change to New Zealand’s obligations to exchange information. Future Protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Protocol will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs and protocols which amend DTAs, to be INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 22 given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that these agreements will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or Denunciation 19 The Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 23 Appendix E Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Commissioner of Inland Revenue signed the Protocol amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (the Second Protocol) on 21 February 2002. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Philippines, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 New Zealand currently has a DTA with the Philippines that came into force on 1 April 1980 referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). When the DTA was negotiated the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines fro the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol) was also negotiated and came into force at the same time. 4 The Second Protocol modifies the DTA and First Protocol in several ways. The main change is that the Second Protocol closes down the potential for abuse of the tax sparing provisions in the DTA. It also contains provisions that update several other aspects of the DTA that were no longer in line with New Zealand’s standard negotiating position. These generally relate to reductions in the level of withholding taxes imposed on cross border flows of dividends, interest, and royalties. Overall, the Second Protocol results in the application of the DTA and First Protocol being more favourable to New Zealand. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 24 Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol is advantageous for New Zealand because it removes tax sparing. Tax sparing is a concession granted by developed countries, (in this case New Zealand) in their DTAs with developing nations. It ensures that tax incentives granted in the developing country to attract foreign investment will not be clawed back by the tax regime of the other country. In the case of New Zealand’s DTAs, tax sparing works by permitting New Zealand taxpayers who invest in a developing country, in this case the Philippines, to take advantage of tax incentives offered there. The New Zealand taxpayers can then claim a foreign tax credit against their New Zealand tax liability on income earned from that investment as if it was tax paid in the other country. 6 The Second Protocol removes this tax sparing feature of the DTA. This will mean New Zealand taxpayers will no longer be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes spared (not paid) in the Philippines. This will increase the taxes paid by those taxpayers in New Zealand. 7 Other amendments have also been made to the DTA and First Protocol in the Second Protocol to reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest and royalties on a reciprocal basis. These rate reductions bring the withholding rates in the DTA more in line with current New Zealand DTA policy. This is advantageous to New Zealand because it further reduces tax impediments associated with cross-border trade and investment with the Philippines. The article in the DTA dealing with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises has also been amended by inserting a provision to ensure that correlative relief is provided in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made. This has the advantage of ensuring that double taxation does not arise as a result of a transfer pricing adjustment made in one country. Obligations 8 The obligations under the Second Protocol are related to the collection of income tax in New Zealand and the Philippines. Under Article V of the Second Protocol New Zealand will no longer have to give tax credits for deemed tax paid in the Philippines. Prior to the Second Protocol, New Zealand was obliged to give tax credits under Article 23 of the DTA even though no tax was paid in the Philippines. Consequently the Second Protocol removes an obligation on New Zealand imposed by the DTA. 9 The Second Protocol also makes five other amendments to the DTA. • A new paragraph 2 has been added to Article 9 of the DTA, which deals with transfer pricing adjustments between associated enterprises. The new paragraph provides a mechanism for correlative relief in the other country once a transfer pricing adjustment has been made, and is now a standard provision in New Zealand’s negotiating model DTA. (This provision also accords with international standards.) • Paragraph 2 of Article 10 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on dividends, from a split rate of 15% (where the beneficial owner of the dividends is a company) and 25% (in all other cases), to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all dividends). The 15% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 25 • Paragraph 2 of Article 11 of the DTA has been amended to reduce the withholding rate imposed on interest from 15% to 10%. The 10% rate is consistent with current New Zealand DTA policy. • Paragraph 2 of Article 12 of the DTA has also been amended to reduce the Philippines withholding rate imposed on royalties from a split rate of 15% (in the case of royalties paid by specified enterprises) and 25% (in all other cases) to a flat rate of 15% (applying to all royalties). The 15% rate is higher than the standard rate of 10% applying in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, but does represent a reduction in Philippines tax, and is in line with the rate applying in some of our DTAs such as those with Canada, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. • Finally, the definition of ‘royalties’ in paragraph 3 of Article 12 of the DTA has been updated to provide a formula which better takes into account modern technology. The new definition follows closely that used in the DTA recently agreed with Russia. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 The removal of tax sparing from the DTA does not impose any costs on New Zealand. On the contrary, it can only give rise to an increase in revenue to New Zealand. 12 There could be revenue costs associated with the application of the reduced withholding rates on interest and dividends from investments made by residents of the Philippines into New Zealand. However, these revenue costs could be offset by revenue gains associated with the reduction in withholding taxes imposed by the Philippines on interest, dividends and royalties earned by New Zealand residents in the Philippines. (The reduction in withholding taxes will mean that more New Zealand tax is paid in relation to those investments.) Future Protocols 13 None anticipated. Implementation 14 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 15 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, and the Tax Administration Act 1994. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 26 Consultation 16 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol Withdrawal or Denunciation 17 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 27 Appendix F Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Second Protocol Amending the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, Signed at the Hague on 15 October 1980 (the Second Protocol) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Second Protocol will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Second Protocol will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Second Protocol in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 New Zealand is party to 27 double tax agreements (DTAs), which are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but which also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The Second Protocol amends a DTA New Zealand has with the Netherlands that came into force in March 1981 and which is more correctly referred to as the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the DTA). The DTA already stands amended by the Protocol to the Convention between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income (the First Protocol), which came into force at the same time as the DTA itself. 4 The Second Protocol was driven primarily by the need to close down a tax avoidance opportunity in New Zealand involving the payment of cross-border insurance premiums to the Netherlands. The opportunity was also taken to make certain other amendments to the DTA to bring it up to date with current DTA and domestic policy in both countries. For instance, the method to be used by the Netherlands for relieving double taxation on certain passive income was altered to reflect Netherlands domestic law, which now adopts the “credit method” rather than the “exemption method”. (This amendment has no implications for New Zealand.) In addition, a “non-discrimination” article and an “other INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 28 income” article were also inserted into the DTA. The non-discrimination article protects nationals and residents (in certain cases) of both countries from discriminatory tax laws (if any), and needed to be inserted pursuant to a “Most Favoured Nation” obligation contained within the DTA itself. The “other income” article allocates taxing rights in respect of income that is not covered by any other specific article in the DTA, and ensures that no items of income will fall out of the DTA. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 5 The Second Protocol will have a number of advantages. The main one is that it closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. In the absence of this amendment it is possible for profits derived from New Zealand by a non-resident to be characterised as insurance premiums and distributed out of New Zealand without being subject to New Zealand tax. This provision ensures that the DTA can no longer be used to prevent New Zealand from applying its domestic law taxing provisions in such circumstances. 6 An Article dealing with “other income” is also inserted into the DTA. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific articles in the DTA. This article provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may be taxed in the other country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The advantage of this is that it provides certainty to taxpayers of both countries that no income will fall out of the DTA and be subject to unrelieved double taxation. 7 The Second Protocol also inserts a “non-discrimination” article into the DTA. The advantages of a non-discrimination article for New Zealand are that our nationals operating in the Netherlands are assured of receiving no worse tax treatment than nationals of the Netherlands in the same circumstances. Thus the Netherlands are constrained from applying any discriminatory tax laws against New Zealand nationals. 8 The Protocol does not have any disadvantages to New Zealand. Obligations 9 Neither the Second Protocol nor the DTA itself (before or after amendment) will impose requirements on taxpayers. The DTA obliges the respective Governments to restrict their taxing rights under domestic law in certain circumstances. In other words, a DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot itself impose tax. The Second Protocol modifies these obligations as follows: • Article I of the Second Protocol inserts an article in the DTA dealing with “other income”. This article is a catch-all article which covers everything not covered by any of the other specific article of the DTA. It provides that any “other income” will be taxable in the country in which the recipient is resident. However, if the income arises in the other country it may also be taxed in that country up to a limit of 15% of the gross amount of the income. The imposes an obligation on New Zealand to limit its taxation of some New Zealand sourced income derived by a resident of the Netherlands (albeit very minor, given that very little income is expected to fall under this article). INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 29 • Article III of the Second Protocol inserts a non-discrimination article into the DTA. This article will prevent New Zealand from imposing discriminatory tax laws on nationals of the Netherlands operating in New Zealand, although New Zealand does not currently impose any such discriminatory tax laws and does not propose to introduce any. This article also requires New Zealand to provide no worse treatment to enterprises owned by Netherlands’ residents that it applies to enterprises of any other state. • Article IV of the Second Protocol closes down a tax loophole involving cross-border insurance premiums. This provision permits New Zealand to impose a minimum level of tax on insurance premiums paid to residents of the Netherlands (and vice versa). This new provision is consistent with the position under New Zealand domestic law. It does not create an additional obligation for New Zealand. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 10 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 11 There may be a small revenue cost associated with limiting source taxation on “other income” to 15% from Netherlands residents earning income in New Zealand. However, this revenue cost could be offset by revenue collected by “other income” earned by New Zealand residents in the Netherlands. It may also be offset by tax withheld on insurance premiums paid by New Zealand residents to the Netherlands. We do not expect that any costs will arise in relation to the non-discrimination article. Future Protocols 12 None anticipated. Implementation 13 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 14 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Consultation 15 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Protocol. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 30 Withdrawal or Denunciation 16 The Second Protocol can be terminated by terminating the DTA. The DTA can be terminated by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year. Prepared by Inland Revenue Department November 2003 INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 31 Appendix G Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims National Interest Analysis Date of Proposed Binding Treaty Action The Minister of Foreign Affairs signed the Convention between New Zealand and the Kingdom of the Netherlands for Mutual Assistance in the Recovery of Tax Claims (the Agreement) on 20 December 2001. Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the Agreement will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The Agreement will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and the Netherlands, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the Agreement in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the Treaty 2 In 1999, New Zealand changed its law to enable it to enter into bilateral “assistance in recovery” agreements, which provide that one country will assist the other country in the recovery of the first country’s unpaid tax. This Agreement with the Netherlands is the first assistance in recovery agreement New Zealand has entered into. 3 In the absence of this Agreement, New Zealand would have to seek judgement in its favour in the Netherlands if it were to recover a debt from a New Zealand taxpayer who went to the Netherlands with New Zealand tax outstanding. The Agreement provides that where New Zealand tax is outstanding in the Netherlands the Netherlands Revenue will recover the tax on New Zealand’s behalf as if the tax was outstanding in the Netherlands. The Agreement applies on a reciprocal basis. It allows both Governments the opportunity to recover unpaid tax more efficiently and effectively than would have been possible without the Agreement. Advantages and Disadvantages to New Zealand of the Treaty Entering into Force 4 The advantage of entering into the Agreement is that it will provide a mechanism for the New Zealand Government to recover unpaid tax from taxpayers living in the Netherlands. This will result in the New Zealand Government being able to collect tax more effectively and efficiently than it would be able to in the absence of the Agreement. 5 A disadvantage of the Agreement is that the obligations are reciprocal in nature. In other words, the Netherlands Government is able to require the New Zealand Government to collect its unpaid tax from taxpayers in New Zealand. It can only do so if all avenues for collecting the tax available in the Netherlands have been exhausted. INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 32 6 On balance it is expected that the advantages of the Agreement will outweigh the disadvantages. The Agreement is closely related to the double tax agreement currently in place with the Netherlands and serves to further strengthen ties between the two Governments in this area. Obligations 7 The obligations under the Agreement are for the New Zealand Government to provide assistance to the Netherlands Government in the collection of unpaid tax. It requires the New Zealand Government to undertake all the procedures for recovery of tax that it would undertake if the tax recovered were New Zealand tax. Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Effects 8 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 9 It is not possible to estimate the costs of the Agreement to New Zealand. The costs relate to the administrative costs in collecting different types of taxes in New Zealand on behalf of the Netherlands Government. It is not expected, however, that there will be a large volume of requests from the Netherlands. Moreover, the obligations are reciprocal in nature and may reduce costs of collecting tax debts owed to the New Zealand Government in respect of taxpayers resident in the Netherlands. Future Protocols 10 None anticipated. Implementation 11 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this Agreement will be implemented by Order in Council pursuant to section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 The Agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section 173 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables assistance in recovery agreements to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the Agreement will override the Income Tax Act 1994 and any other enactment relating to unpaid tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the Agreement and will effectively override the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 13 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the Agreement. Withdrawal or Denunciation 14 Article 8 provides that either contracting state may terminate the Agreement by giving notice of termination through diplomatic channels. This requires an exchange of notes INTERNATIONAL TREATY EXAMINATION OF TAXATION AGREEMENTS 33 whereby one country gives notice of termination and the other country confirms receipt of the notice.

Zealand companies gaining access to offshore venture capital. The main change is to provide an exemption from income tax for certain non-residents that sell shares in unlisted New Zealand companies. Profits from the sale of such shares may currently be taxable if a non-resident has purchased them with the purpose of resale or the proceeds from the shares are a part of the non-resident’s business income. Non-residents will generally be eligible for the exemption if they are resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement and would not be eligible for a tax credit in their home jurisdiction for any New Zealand tax paid if the income were taxable in New Zealand. These criteria will generally be met by residents that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction. The new rules also provide that certain foreign funds of funds (FFOFs) will qualify as eligible investors. In a venture capital context, a FFOF pools funds on behalf of a number of international investors and invests the capital in local venture capital funds. The changes will also see the repeal of section HC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This section currently prohibits partners of special partnerships from offsetting special partnership tax losses against their other income. 4 ELIGIBLE INVESTMENT Issue: Widening the concept of eligible investment to include assets other than shares Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Under the current proposal, the rules will exempt gains from the sale of shares in an eligible New Zealand company. PWC note that, for a number of commercial considerations, an investor may want to invest in instruments that have equity characteristics but are not shares. Examples of such instruments are options and profit-linked interest bearing debentures. For this reason PWC suggest that the exemption should apply to gains derived from the disposal of equity and debt. MERW considers that the form of an investment should not determine whether the tax exemption should apply. It is suggested that the proposed exemption should be extended to include the sale of New Zealand business assets. Comment The purpose of the proposed changes is to remove tax barriers to venture capital investment. A key characteristic of venture capital investment is that the venture capital investor’s return is connected directly with the performance of the company into which the investment is made. Therefore a venture capital investment is generally an equity rather than a debt investment. This explains why the current proposals are limited to an investment in shares. The current definition of “share” in section OB 1(a) encompasses investments that have both debt and equity characteristics. That is, in subparagraph (ii) of section OB 1(a) a debenture to which section FC 1 applies is included in the definition of “share”. A debenture of this type is one where the interest payable is determined by reference to the dividends payable or the company’s profits. As the return from such a debenture is linked directly to the performance of the company, it is appropriate that such an investment is included in the ambit of the proposed rules. Therefore the definition of “share” that should apply for the purposes of the new rules is that contained in paragraph (a) of the definition of “share” in section OB 1. This definition would not encompass a share option because a share option is not a direct “interest in the capital of a company”. However, the economic substance of a share option (the option to purchase shares in a company at a given price at some time in the future) is clearly akin to an equity interest in that company. Therefore officials consider that an option to purchase shares in a company at a given price at some time in the future should be encompassed as an eligible investment in the new rules. 5 Under the proposed change, an interest in a company in the form of a convertible note that is converted into shares before the sale of those shares would not qualify as an eligible investment. However, officials consider that it is appropriate that where an interest in a company is held in the form of a convertible note and converted into shares before the sale of that interest, that interest should qualify as an eligible investment if the interest has been held for at least 12 months. This is consistent with the Australian approach and provides further flexibility when investing in venture capital. Officials do not consider that the exemption should be extended to include the sale of New Zealand business assets. The proposals are aimed at venture capital investments. The return from a venture capital investment is typically the profit on the sale of shares rather than the sale of the underlying assets of a business. Recommendation That the proposed venture capital exemption encompasses the sale of shares (as per the definition of “share” in paragraph (a) of section OB 1) and share options. The exemption should also be extended to accommodate interests purchased as convertible notes where the interest has been held for at least 12 months and which are converted to shares before sale. Issue: Extending the exemption to cover dividends Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The current proposal would not amend the tax treatment of any dividends that the foreign investor derived from the investment in the New Zealand company. Generally, such dividends would be subject to non-resident withholding tax of 15%. The same logic that exempts non-residents that are tax-exempt in their own country from New Zealand tax on their revenue account capital gains, applies equally to any tax that New Zealand may levy on dividends. That is, their tax exempt status in their home country will mean that they are unable to claim a tax credit for any tax that New Zealand may levy on dividends. Therefore the exemption should be extended to cover dividends. Comment Officials do not consider that the exemption should be extended to cover dividends. This would go further than the aim of the proposals, which is to facilitate typical venture capital investments. Consultation revealed that venture capital investors would expect to gain the vast majority of their return from an increase in the value of the underlying share rather than a distribution of dividends. This was confirmed by representatives of the venture capital industry. 6 In addition, the approach of excluding dividends from the ambit of the proposed regime is consistent with the Australian approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for manager’s carried interest Submission (16 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association) The proposed rules should provide an exemption for the fund manager’s “carried interest”. Such an exemption would mean that New Zealand’s rules would be competitive with those in Australia. Comment In certain venture capital fund manager structures it is common for a portion of the venture capital fund manager’s fee to be linked directly with the performance of the underlying investments. This portion of the manager’s fee (referred to as the “carried interest”) is often structured as a given percentage of the profits when the shares are eventually realised. The purpose of such fee structures is to provide the manager with an additional incentive to perform. The Australian rules provide a tax concession for the carried interest by deeming it to be a capital return. By treating it as a capital return, the tax rate that applies is halved. Officials do not consider that the New Zealand rules should provide a similar tax concession for the manager’s carried interest. The carried interest portion of the manager’s fee is akin to a performance bonus and should be taxed as such. In addition, a rule that deemed the carried interest to be a capital return for tax purposes would have the effect of rendering the manager’s return tax-free. This is because, unlike Australia, New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 Issue: Property development, royalties and lease payments as excluded activities Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The prohibited activities in the proposed section CB 2(1)(g)(iii) should be amended. “Property development” in sub-sub-paragraph (A) should be amended so that it refers to “land development” and the references to “royalties” and “lease payments” in sub- sub-paragraph (H) should be removed. Comment Officials agree that the reference to “property development” on the list of main activities which are excluded from the rules in CB 2(1)(g)(iii) is too wide because the property referred to could include intellectual property and other property which is not land. This is not the intention as the exclusion is aimed at land development. Many venture capital-funded companies will derive income in the form of royalties from licensing intellectual property or leasing technology. Therefore to include this type of income on the list of excluded activities would be unnecessarily restrictive and possibly disqualify a large portion of potential investee companies. Therefore officials agree with the submissions and recommend that the reference to “royalties” in section CB 2(1)(g)(iii)(H) be removed. The reference to “lease payments” could include also include a “royalty”. This is not the intention. Therefore it is recommended that the term “lease payments” remain in section CB 2(1)(g)(iii)(H) but with an exclusion for a lease payment that is also a “royalty”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Holding companies – ownership requirement of subsidiaries Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement in the proposed section CB 2(1)(h)(iii) that companies which receive funding from a holding company must be part of the same wholly owned group should be removed. 8 Comment In the venture capital industry it is common for an investor to acquire a company in which the founding or existing shareholders retain an equity interest in the company. This is a common scenario because the investor may want to grow the company but retain the skills of the current management and shareholders. Equity participation is also often a factor in attracting senior management. Under the current proposal, however, an investment in a holding company can qualify as an eligible investment only if the companies into which it invests are 100 percent owned by it. This excludes the scenario described above, because the existing shareholder will own the equity of some part of the company. This may inhibit the operation of the new rules. Officials therefore agree with the submission and recommend that there be no requirement that the holding company and the companies into which the investments are made are part of the same wholly-owned group. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Residence of holding company subsidiaries Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement in section CB 2(1)(h)(iii) for all subsidiaries of a holding company to be resident in New Zealand should be removed. Comment Officials do not agree with this interpretation of the proposed section CB 2(1)(h)(iii). The proposed rule requires only that a holding company have a “main activity” of investing in eligible companies. Therefore a holding company may have non-New Zealand subsidiaries and be an eligible investment as long as its main activity is not investing in non-New Zealand companies. Officials agree that the provision should be extended further so that eligible holding companies can have a have “main activity” of investing in non-New Zealand resident companies. The current requirement that the main activity of the holding company is investing in New Zealand resident companies could provide a barrier to New Zealand companies expanding into offshore markets. However, the requirement in the bill that the New Zealand companies that the holding company invests into (as part of its main activity) are all eligible investments should remain. This will ensure that the provisions are properly targeted at venture capital. 9 In addition, the recommended removal of the requirement for investments to be made into companies that were all part of the same wholly owned group (as discussed in the previous submission) should add some additional flexibility in this area. Generally, the intention of this proposed provision is to ensure that venture capital funds which are invested in New Zealand and qualify for the tax exemption are used to fund New Zealand venture capital companies. However, officials are comfortable that there is no mischief in allowing foreign investors in unlisted holding companies which invest in foreign companies to be exempt from the gain on the sale of their interest in that holding company. The portion of the gain that relates to the non- resident company is effectively non-New Zealand sourced income of a non-resident and is currently subject to New Zealand tax only in a limited number of circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Redrafting the 12-month rule Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The drafting of the proposed rules in section CB 2(1)(g)(i) and section CB 2(1)(h)(i) result in unnecessary complexity. Comment The proposed rules in section CB 2(1)(g)(i) and section CB 2(1)(h)(i) provide that, for an investment to qualify for exemption, the shares must be held for at least 12 months before they are sold. The proposed provisions achieve this through a requirement that “...the share is purchased...on a day that is 12 months or more before the day of the sale...” Officials do not consider that this drafting is particularly complex and, therefore, do not consider that an amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 Issue: Redrafting the listing requirement Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed rules in section CB 2(1)(g)(ii) and section CB 2(1)(h)(ii) are complex and should be clarified. Comment The proposed rules in sections CB 2(1)(g)(ii) and CB 2(1)(h)(ii) specify for what periods the shares that are purchased cannot be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. The intention of the provisions is to provide that: • if the shares are listed when they are purchased they must be de-listed within 12 months; and • if shares that were listed when they are purchased are de-listed within 12 months they cannot be listed again within the next 12 months Officials agree that the current drafting of these rules is complex and consider that they should be redrafted. Officials also recognise that the requirement that a de-listed company cannot be re-listed for 12 months is inflexible and may not accommodate all genuine venture capital investment strategies. Therefore officials propose that the listing requirements for eligible venture capital investments are simply that the company is either unlisted at the time the shares are purchased or, if it is listed at the time of purchase, that the company is de-listed within 12 months. This will make the listing requirements more flexible and enable the simplified drafting of these requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 11 Issue: Definition of “recognised exchange” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “recognised exchange” in section OB 1 should be amended so that it applies for the purposes of section CB 2(1)(g) and section CB 2(1)(h). Comment The proposed section CB 2(1)(g) and section CB 2(1)(h) refer to “recognised exchange”. Section OB 1 contains a definition of “recognised exchange”. Section OB 1 should be amended so that it applies for the purposes of CB 2(1)(g) and section CB 2(1)(h). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 ELIGIBLE INVESTORS Issue: Expanding the list of preferred countries for FFOFs Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ), 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts (MERW)) Under the current proposals, foreign funds of funds (FFOFs) qualify for the venture capital tax exemption only if they are established in one of eight countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Singapore, France, Germany and Japan). A number of submissions have suggested that the number of eligible countries should be increased. ICANZ notes that the equivalent Australian tax rules have been criticised for being too restrictive in including countries on the FFOF eligible list. They suggest that, in order to attract investment, the New Zealand rules should be as flexible as possible. ICANZ submits that the New Zealand rules should include as an eligible country all countries with which we have an exchange-of-information agreement. PWC are also concerned that the current list of countries is unduly restrictive and, as a result, will not attract substantial investment from FFOFs. It is noted that commercial considerations often mean that FFOFs are established in internationally recognised fund management centres such as Luxembourg and Belgium – not eligible countries under the current proposal. MERW note that, under the current proposals, an FFOF that is established in a tax haven will not qualify as an eligible investor. They suggest, however, that such FFOFs are likely to be the greatest source of potential venture capital investment. They suggest that FFOFs established in such countries should be made eligible investors to the extent that the investors in the FFOF would have been eligible if they had invested directly (rather than through the FFOF). Comment The key aim of the venture capital proposals is to remove New Zealand tax for foreign investors if the foreign investor cannot benefit from a credit in their home country for the New Zealand tax levied. This inability to benefit from a tax credit will generally arise from the fact that foreign investors are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction. However, for Inland Revenue to be able to administer these rules effectively, it was also considered necessary to allow the exemption to such investors only if they were resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). The exchange-of-information Article in DTAs (with the exception of the DTA with Switzerland) allows Inland Revenue to request relevant tax information from the competent authority in the DTA country. 13 The aim of targeting tax-exempt foreign investors, and the need for Inland Revenue to monitor the rules effectively, explains why the current proposals would allow non- residents that cannot benefit from a tax credit in their own jurisdiction to qualify, provided they are resident in a DTA country (with the exception of Switzerland). Extending the rules to exempt certain FFOFs did not accord entirely with the key aim of targeting tax-exempt foreign investors. To meet this aim, in respect of FFOFs, it would have been strictly necessary to look through the FFOF for tax purposes and exempt the ultimate investors in the FFOF if those investors would not benefit from a tax credit for any New Zealand tax levied and they were resident in a DTA country (with the exception of Switzerland). Investors in the FFOF that did not meet these two tests would not gain the benefit of the automatic exemption and could face tax if the shares were held on revenue account. However, it was considered that this “pure” approach would give rise to compliance costs for FFOFs and their investors (that would ultimately reduce the likelihood of receiving any such investment) and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It was therefore considered appropriate to provide the exemption to the FFOF itself, provided that there was a reasonable likelihood that the majority of the ultimate investors in the FFOF would not benefit from a tax credit in their home jurisdiction and were resident in a DTA country. Given that the FFOF rules compromised the policy aim of targeting non-residents that would not benefit from a tax credit, it was considered appropriate to limit the countries where eligible FFOFs could be established not only to DTA countries, but also those countries where there was a reasonable prospect of investment from FFOFs. This explains the current list of eight countries. The submissions suggest that investment from FFOFs is likely to arise in countries that are not included on our current list of eight. These include countries that could be considered tax havens, as well as countries with which we currently have a DTA. While we agree with these submissions, we still consider that it is necessary that an exchange of information agreement exist between New Zealand and the FFOF’s country of establishment. This would allow Inland Revenue to administer the rules effectively. Therefore we consider that it is appropriate for the list of eligible countries where an FFOF can be established to be the same as that which applies for direct investors under the proposed section CB 2(4)(a). Under this proposal, there would be one list of eligible countries for all categories of investors and it would comprise those countries with which New Zealand has a DTA (with the exception of Switzerland). Recommendation That the list of eligible countries where an FFOF can be established be the same as that which applies for the proposed section CB 2(4)(a). 14 Issue: Targeting of non-residents that would not receive a credit for any New Zealand tax imposed Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Under the current proposal, the exemption is targeted at venture capital investors that would in no circumstances be able to receive a tax credit in their home country for the imposition of any New Zealand tax that would, in the absence of the proposed exemption, be imposed on the sale of the share. A number of submissions have expressed concern that the proposed approach of targeting the availability of tax credits would be difficult to apply in certain circumstances and may give rise to an incorrect result. It is noted that investors may not be eligible to benefit from the provision of a tax credit for New Zealand tax paid in a situation where they can offset income in their home country with losses that are carried forward. It is also suggested that the change may apply more widely than intended as it would exempt foreign investors that would not benefit from a tax credit for New Zealand tax paid because their home country has a rule that does not tax income of this nature if the income arises from a preferred country such as New Zealand. One submission suggests that, given the proposals are intended to target tax exempt investors, the drafting should simply use words along the lines of “tax exempt or effectively tax exempt”. Comment The target of the proposed exemption is non-resident investors that are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax on profits from the sale of private equity. The reason such investors may be sensitive to New Zealand tax is the fact that often they are exempt from tax in their home country (for example, United States pension funds). This is because investors that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction will not be able to claim a credit in their own country for the New Zealand tax imposed. As one submission suggests, one option for targeting the category of investors that are likely to be sensitive to the New Zealand tax is simply for the rules to refer to “exempt or effectively exempt”. The problem with this approach is that there would be some uncertainty as to whether certain investors would qualify for the exemption. For example, certain investors may at the outset be taxed in their home country on the profits, but can later receive a refund of the tax that was initially levied. In such a case it could be difficult to maintain that the investor was “exempt” or even “effectively exempt” from tax. Australia uses the words “exempt or effectively exempt” to target tax-sensitive non- resident venture capital investors. However, Australia has a registration board (the Pooled Development Fund (PDF) Board) that registers eligible investors and investments and administers the rules. The PDF Board can consider on a case-by- case basis whether an investor is “exempt or effectively exempt” and, if it is satisfied, it can provide certainty to the investor through registration. The New Zealand rules 15 would operate through self-assessment rather than a registration system. Therefore it is important that investors can themselves determine with a degree of certainty whether they qualify. Therefore officials still consider that the approach of targeting the new rules to investors that would not, essentially, receive a financial benefit from tax that would otherwise be levied in New Zealand is the correct approach. In addition, officials consider that foreign investors that would not receive a financial benefit from the imposition of New Zealand tax because, for example, their home country does not tax such investments if they arise in a preferred country (such as New Zealand) should qualify for the exemption under the new rules. Given that their home country does not tax the amount, the foreign investors are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. On the other hand, officials do not consider that the exemption should be available to investors that cannot receive a financial benefit from the imposition of New Zealand tax simply because of personal circumstances, such as the availability of tax losses. This is the reason why the words “...in no circumstances...” is included in the proposed section CB 2(4)(a)(iii) and the words “...in any circumstances...” are included in the proposed section CB 2(4)(b)(vi)(B) and the proposed section CB 2(4)(c)(vi)(B). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing requirements Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is currently no guidance in the proposed provisions as to when, and for what periods, a “qualifying foreign equity investor” must satisfy the required tests. In addition, the current proposals do not clarify adequately when, and for what period, a relevant New Zealand company must qualify under the new rules. An amendment is required that provides clarity on this issue. Comment Officials agree that the proposed rules should be clarified. The policy underlying the proposals is that the foreign investor should satisfy the definition of QFEI at all times during the period of the investment – that is, from the time that the share is purchased until the time that it is disposed of. The proposed new section CB 2(1)(g) should be amended to clarify this. 16 In addition, the bill should be amended to clarify that the company into which an investment is made cannot have a main activity that is one of the listed prohibited activities for the period of the investment – that is, from the time that the share is purchased until the time that it is disposed of. The proposed new section CB 2(1)(g) should be amended to clarify this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exemption should apply to all non-residents Submission (4 – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (NZVIF), 16 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association (NZVCA)) The proposed exemption should apply to all non-residents, regardless of their domestic tax status. Comment Officials do not agree with these submissions. The exemption is aimed at non- residents that are likely to be sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. Extending the exemption to all non-residents would mean that investors that were taxable in their home jurisdiction would qualify for the exemption. These investors are not likely to be sensitive to New Zealand tax as they would be able to offset the tax in their home jurisdiction with a credit for the New Zealand tax paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Accommodating foreign funds of funds that are structured as limited liability partnerships that have separate legal entity status Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed definition of QFEI in section CB 2(4)(b) should be widened to include FFOFs that are structured as limited liability partnerships but also have separate legal entity status. This should be done by deleting the proposed section CB 2(4)(b)(viii). 17 Comment Officials agree that section CB 2(4)(b)(viii) should be deleted. Currently, the bill requires that to be a QFEI under section CB 2(4)(b), an investor must be structured as a limited partnership that is legally equivalent to a New Zealand special partnership (section CB 2(4)(b)(viii)). This is likely to give rise to a significant degree of uncertainty as the limited partnership rules in various jurisdictions can differ significantly from New Zealand’s special partnership rules. However, limited liability partnerships that are separate legal entities will be dealt with under section CB 2(4)(c), which deals with incorporated bodies, rather than widening section CB 2(4)(b). Section CB 2(4)(b) will cover only limited liability partnerships which, like New Zealand special partnerships, do not have separate legal entity status but there will no longer be a requirement that they are legally equivalent to New Zealand special partnerships. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that the proposed section CB 2(4)(b)(viii) is deleted from the bill. Issue: Accommodating foreign funds of funds that are structured as limited liability companies Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The definition of QFEI under section CB 2(4)(c) should be amended so that FFOFs that are structured as separate legal entities (such as United States limited liability companies (LLCs)) can make allocations of income to members that are not in proportion to the members’ interest in the capital. Comment Currently, the proposed section CB 2(4)(c) requires that for a FFOF that is structured as a separate legal entity to meet the QFEI definition it must, among other things, have members who are entitled to shares of the income of the entity that are in proportion to their capital interest in the entity (section CB 2(4)(c)(ii)). This provision is designed to accommodate entities such as LLCs by describing their common features. However, LLCs may, in certain circumstances, be permitted to make disproportionate allocations of income to their members. The ability to make such disproportionate allocations may, therefore, disqualify such LLCs from the proposed rules. This is not appropriate. 18 Therefore officials consider that the proposed section CB 2(4)(c) should be amended to remove the requirement that members of the entity must be entitled to income in proportion to their capital interest in the entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Disqualification of FFOFs Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) There is no reason why the ineligibility of one of the partners or members of a FFOF should disqualify the whole fund from qualifying as a QFEI. Comment A FFOF may currently not have any member or partner who owns more than ten percent of the fund and is not resident in a listed country. The new rules are targeted at tax-exempt investors. These investors often invest through foreign funds of funds. The proposed legislation is not trying to target taxable investors who may be indifferent to the imposition of New Zealand tax. Therefore funds that include large investments from taxable investors will not qualify. If the presence of one ineligible investor did not disqualify the entire fund, Inland Revenue would be in a position of providing the exemption to the extent that the fund consisted of investors who met the criteria. This would involve Inland Revenue having to “look through” the fund to determine the tax status and ownership interest of every investor. Officials believe that such a measure would be impractical and would impose large administrative costs. Officials accept that FFOFs will contain a mix of tax-exempt and non-tax-exempt investors. However, the information we have received has led us to believe that many of the big FFOFs are made up of predominantly tax-exempt investors and that the ten percent limit on taxable interests in an eligible fund of fund will not disqualify from the rules many of these types of investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 Issue: Targeting investors with a 10% or less tax rate Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The regime should be aimed not only at those who are effectively tax exempt or have a 0% tax rate but also those who effectively have a tax rate of 10% or less. Comment The proposal is aimed at foreign investors who are sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax. This is generally non-residents that are tax-exempt in their own jurisdiction, as such investors would be unable to benefit from a credit (or other compensation from their domestic tax authority) for any tax that they may pay in New Zealand. The targeting of such tax-sensitive investors will be achieved in the new rule by focussing on whether non-residents are able to gain a financial benefit in their own country from the imposition of New Zealand tax (see sections CB 2(4)(a)(iii); CB 2(4)(b)(vi)(B); CB 2(4)(c)(vi)(B)). Such financial benefit would normally be in the form of a tax credit for the New Zealand tax paid. If the submission’s suggestion were to be applied it would be necessary to amend the rules that seek to ascertain whether the investor will gain a financial benefit from the imposition of New Zealand tax, to provide the exemption if the financial benefit arising from the imposition of New Zealand tax was not significant. Officials consider that a formulation along these lines would give rise to uncertainty and, therefore, should not be adopted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Residence of QFEI in a DTA country Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The residence requirement in CB 2(4)(a)(i) should be amended so it applies to tax- exempt entities, and the residence requirement in CB 2(4)(c) should be removed. The only requirement for qualifying foreign equity investors in subsections (b) and (c) should be that the investor is established (rather than resident) in a DTA country. 20 Comment To be a qualifying equity investor under CB 2(4)(a)(i), a person must be resident in a territory under a DTA between New Zealand and that territory (excluding Switzerland). This provision is targeted at investors that cannot benefit from a tax credit in their home jurisdiction for New Zealand tax paid – generally tax-exempts. However, under many of New Zealand’s DTAs a person can only be resident of a country if they are “liable to tax” in that country. The issue therefore arises whether a tax exempt investor is “liable to tax” and, therefore, a resident under the DTA. The better interpretation of “liable to tax” is that entities that are tax exempt under their country’s tax laws are “liable to tax”. The fact that a country provides an entity with an exemption does not mean that the entity is not liable to that country’s tax laws. Therefore no amendment is needed. There is also a residence requirement in section CB 2(4)(c). Paragraph (c) targets FFOFs that are structured as entities that are flow-through for tax purposes but use a company form. However, there is currently some uncertainty about the ability of such an entity to be tax-resident under many of New Zealand’s DTAs because a flow- through entity is transparent and, therefore, not subject to the country’s tax laws. Therefore the presence of a residency requirement would mean that a FFOF could generally not qualify as a QFEI. The rule should, therefore, be amended to remove the requirement that the FFOF be resident in a particular country. A residence requirement is, however, required to disqualify FFOFs that do become resident in a country that treats them as an entity and taxes them as such. The reason for this is that such FFOFs are unlikely to be sensitive to the imposition of New Zealand tax as they will generally be able to claim a credit for New Zealand tax paid in their home jurisdiction. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted. The residence requirement in the proposed section CB 2(4)(c) should be amended to remove the requirement for the FFOF to be resident in a particular country. A residence test should be added that disqualifies FFOFs that are resident in a country and that country taxes the FFOF as an entity. Issue: Exempt investors in a foreign fund of a fund structured as a partnership Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The exemption provided in section CB 2(4)(b) should be provided to the individual partners of the unincorporated body (the limited partnership) rather than the partnership itself. 21 Comment A limited partnership is flow-through for tax purposes. In cases where New Zealand recognises a foreign limited partnership as a partnership and treats it as flow-through for tax purposes, any New Zealand tax will be imposed on the partners rather than the partnership itself. However, the proposed section CB 2(4)(b) provides the exemption to the partnership itself. This will have no effect as the partnership is effectively ignored for tax purposes. Therefore the proposed section CB 2(4)(b) should be amended to provide the exemption to the partners of the foreign limited partnership, provided that the partnership itself qualifies under the other requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Introduction of eligible investment vehicles and a registration system Submission (4 – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) The regime should be available only to those investing through eligible investment vehicles and who are approved through a registration process, similar to that which operates in Australia. Comment The New Zealand Venture Investment Fund (VIF) suggests that the rules around the eligibility of foreign investors are overly restrictive and should be relaxed, but does, however, acknowledge that some restrictions are necessary. The necessary rules are best administered, it suggests, by defining eligible investment vehicles and approving investors through a registration process, similar to Australia’s. Officials consider that a system (like that in Australia) that registered eligible investors and eligible investments would be overly restrictive and bureaucratic. Such a system would impose compliance costs for investors and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Officials consider that the proposed rules are sufficiently robust to prevent abuse of the regime and provide the opportunity for Inland Revenue to access sufficient information so that any suspected abuse can be investigated appropriately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Issue: Countries in which a direct QFEI can be resident Submission (4 – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) In relation to the proposed section CB 2(4)(a)(i), the list of countries in which an investor can be resident should be widened, at least on a case by case basis. Comment The reason that investors must be resident in certain countries (DTA countries with the exception of Switzerland) is to provide Inland Revenue with the opportunity to exchange information. This is necessary in order to administer the proposed rules. However, officials recognise that effective information exchange agreements may be negotiated in the future outside the context of a full DTA. If this occurs there may be some scope to extend the list of eligible countries outside those where there is a DTA. Recommendation That where an effective exchange-of-information agreement is negotiated with a country (outside the context of a full DTA), consideration be given to making the country eligible under the proposed venture capital rules. Issue: Redrafting of CB 2(4)(a)(iii) Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The words “would in no circumstances be entitled to” in section CB 2(4)(a)(iii) should be replaced with the words “is not entitled to” for the purposes of clarity. Comment ICANZ have submitted that the words “in no circumstances” are unnecessary and add doubt as to when the section applies. This wording is designed to catch only those investors who are tax-exempt or in a similar position from a tax perspective. As mentioned earlier, officials consider the current words are necessary to exclude investors who are not tax-exempt, or in a similar position to a tax-exempt investor, but are unable to receive a financial benefit from the government because of a temporary feature of their current circumstances, such as being in a tax loss position. There is a risk that the wording suggested by the ICANZ submission would not exclude investors in such a position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: The scope of the associated persons test Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The associated persons test used in section CB 2(4)(b)(v)(A) and (vi)(A) and CB 2(4)(c)(v)(A) and (vi)(A) is too wide because it could associate all partners in a FFOF. Comment The test referred to in these sections is the test laid down in OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, this test is too wide and could result in all the partners of a FFOF, structured as a partnership, being associated. This would mean that if a fund had one taxable investor or an investor not resident in a DTA country, the FFOF would not be an eligible investor because this investor would taint every investor in the fund by association. The PWC submission has suggested using section OD 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in place of OD 8(3). Officials agree that OD 8(3) is too wide and note that it is not the intended effect of this test to associate all of the investors in a FFOF. However, officials consider that the test in OD 7 is deficient because it does not cover trusts. Therefore officials are of the opinion that OD 8(1) should be the associated persons test used for the purpose of the sections in question. This test avoids the problems with OD 8(3) but is wide enough in scope to cover certain situations involving trusts. Recommendation That the submission be partially accepted and the associated persons test in sections CB 2(4)(b)(v)(A) and (vi)(A) and CB 2(4)(c)(v)(A) and (vi)(A) be changed from the test provided in section OD 8(3) to that in OD 8(1) of the Income Tax Act. Issue: FFOFs established under State laws Submission (Matter raised by officials) FFOFs should be allowed to qualify as QFEIs under section CB 2(4)(b) and section CB 2(4)(c) even if they are established under the state laws of a jurisdiction. Comment Under the proposed section CB 2(4)(b) and section CB 2(4)(c), an FFOF can qualify as a QFEI if it “...is established under the laws of a territory”. A territory in this context refers to the foreign country. FFOFs are typically limited partnerships or foreign hybrids that are established under the state laws of a particular jurisdiction. There is some doubt whether the current drafting of the proposed section CB 2(4)(b) and section CB 2(4)(c) would extend to cover FFOFs established under a country’s 24 state laws. It is therefore recommended that these provisions be amended to clarify that a limited partnership or foreign hybrid established under the state laws of a particular country can qualify under the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS Issue: Extending the removal of the loss ring-fencing to release losses accumulated under the old rules Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Under the current tax rules, partners of special partnerships cannot offset special partnership tax losses against their other income. These losses must be carried forward and offset against future special partnership income (section HC 1 refers). The proposal in the bill would remove this restriction for losses incurred from 1 April 2004. The restriction should also be removed for special partnership losses incurred before 1 April 2004 and carried forward because the deferred deduction rules address any concerns about the quality of the accumulated losses. Comment Officials do not agree with the suggested approach. Removing the loss ring-fencing rules for special partnership losses incurred before 1 April 2004 and applying the deferred deduction rules to these losses could result in uncertainty as to whether the deferred deduction rule should apply to suspend such losses. The application of the deferred deduction criteria to transactions that were entered into in past years could in many cases be very difficult. Recommendation That the submission is not accepted. Issue: Tax position of investors not subject to the regime Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The provision of an exemption from tax on particular revenue account capital gains of certain non-residents may imply that similar capital gains of investors that do not qualify under the new rules are subject to tax. This could be addressed by including a provision in the bill to the effect that the new rules do not alter the tax position of investors who do not qualify under the regime. 26 Comment Officials do not agree that the new exemption will give rise to an adverse inference that similar investments not covered by the exemption are automatically taxable. Under the current tax rules, profits from the sale of shares will only be taxable if, broadly, the shares were purchased with the dominant purpose of resale or the profits form part of the investor’s business income. The new exemption is designed to remove a risk that certain foreign investors could be caught by these rules. Officials acknowledge that, in many cases, the automatic exemption afforded by the new rules would not be necessary. While it is not considered that an amendment is required to clarify the position of non- qualifying investors, officials understand the concern raised by PWC. It is suggested, therefore, that the Tax Information Bulletin that is published covering the enactment of the new legislation should make it clear that the intention of the new rules is not to affect the tax position of non-qualifying investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the relevant Tax Information Bulletin make it clear that the intention of the new rules is not to affect the tax position of investors that are not covered by the new rules. Issue: Mutual recognition of regimes between Australia and New Zealand Submission (4 – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund) There should be mutual recognition in Australia and New Zealand of the other country’s venture capital tax regimes. This would mean that foreign venture capital investors would see Australia and New Zealand as a single venture capital market. Comment Officials consider that this proposal has merit and should be pursued with Australia. Currently, the Australian venture capital tax concessions apply only if the venture capital investment is made into an Australian resident company. Similarly, under the proposed New Zealand rules, the tax exemption would only apply if the investment was made into a New Zealand resident company. There is some merit in both countries considering whether their respective exemptions could be extended to apply to an investment made into the other country. The advantage of this approach would be that a non-resident venture capital investor could access New Zealand and Australian venture capital opportunities without being required to make separate investments into New Zealand and Australia. 27 Officials are in discussion with their Australian counterparts on this issue and it is hoped some progress can be made in the medium term. Recommendation It should be noted that New Zealand officials are in discussion with their Australian counterparts on this issue. Issue: Introduction of an internationally recognised limited partnership regime and the tax treatment of foreign hybrid entities Submission (4 – New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 16 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association) New Zealand should introduce an internationally recognised limited liability partnership regime which includes the following features: • It is simple and familiar to international investors. • The entities should be re-named “limited liability partnerships”. • It provides certainty in relation to limitation of liability and tax flow through treatment – including separate legal entity status. The current bill should complement and accommodate the introduction of such an entity. In addition, the proposed reform should include a clarification of the tax treatment of foreign hybrid entities. Comment International venture capital investors prefer to invest through limited liability partnerships. The absence of such a vehicle is perceived as a barrier to attracting venture capital to New Zealand. While New Zealand has a form of limited liability partnerships (called special partnerships), these vehicles lack some of the standard features that many consider are required for venture capital investing and may have outdated and inappropriate administrative requirements. The creation of an internationally recognised limited liability partnership regime in New Zealand is largely a regulatory issue and is currently being considered by the Ministry of Economic Development. The main features of such a vehicle are limited liability status for limited partners, unlimited liability for general partners, flow- through tax treatment and separate legal entity status. Separate legal entity status is seen as important to ensure that the limited liability of limited partners is recognised in cross-jurisdictional transactions. 28 Under current tax law, however, an entity with separate legal entity status will be taxed as a company and, therefore, will not be flow-through for tax purposes. The issue of separate legal entity status was an issue that was raised with Inland Revenue late in the consultation process. Inland Revenue and Treasury officials are now aware of this issue and are in the process of reviewing whether the provision of tax flow- through status to an entity with separate legal entity status is appropriate. However, this is a complex issue and the review will take some time to complete. Officials are unlikely to be in a position to recommend a course of action on this issue until November 2004. Therefore, it is likely that changes to the regulatory regime for special partnerships will not occur until after the tax issues associated with the provision of separate legal entity status are settled. The clarification of the tax treatment of entities known as foreign hybrids (foreign entities which look like companies but are taxed on a flow-through basis) is also an issue that Inland Revenue and Treasury tax officials are currently working on. Officials are currently bilaterally addressing, with the United States, the issue of the status of foreign hybrids under our double tax agreement. Measures to address the issues around New Zealand residents investing in foreign hybrids are due to be introduced in the first taxation bill of 2005. Recommendation That the introduction of an internationally recognised limited liability partnership regime and the clarification of the treatment of foreign hybrid entities cannot be achieved as part of this bill. Issue: Drafting in CB 2(4)(b)(iv) and (c)(v) Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Sections CB 2(4)(b)(iv) and (c)(v) contain double negatives and should be removed. Comment These sections contain requirements that a FFOF contain no member or general partner that is not resident of an approved country. In the context of the bill, officials consider that this is the clearest way to draft this particular concept. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 Issue: The description of flow through tax treatment Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The phrase “as not being subject to tax on income other than as a body that handles the income of its members” in CB 2(4)(b)(vii) and (c)(iii) is difficult to interpret and should be clarified. Comment This phrase is designed to describe a person that has flow through tax treatment. In the absence of any legal term for a person of this nature, officials are of the opinion that in the context of this bill, the description is the appropriate way to describe this concept. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Redrafting of CB 2(6) Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Subsections (a) and (b) of section CB 2(6) need to be clarified as it is unclear what they mean. Comment Officials consider that this drafting achieves the correct result and that it is not unclear and, therefore, do not consider that an amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 Issue: Redrafting of cross-referencing Submission (Matter raised by officials) The cross-reference in section CB 2(1)(h)(iv) needs to be redrafted to avoid confusion. Comment The current wording of this cross-reference could lead to some confusion because the subsection refers to companies “other than the resident company”, while the cross- referenced subsections are based on the “resident company” meeting the criteria they set out. Therefore the cross-reference does not work as it was intended and needs to be changed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: General partners of a special partnership – section HC 1 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 24 should be amended so that the repeal of section HC 1 applies to special partnership losses of general partners and special partners of special partnerships. Comment The effect of the current drafting of clause 24(2) is that the special partnership losses of general partners of the special partnership that are incurred after 1 April 2004 would still be subject to the loss ring-fencing rules in section HC 1. The intention of the proposed clause 24(2) is that the losses of general partners of special partnerships would not be subject to section HC 1. It is therefore recommended that clause 24(2) be amended so that section HC 1 is repealed for general partners of special partnerships in respect of special partnership losses incurred after 1 April 2004. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 31 Issue: Section 57 of the Partnership Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 145, repealing section 57 of the Partnership Act 1908, should be removed from the bill. Comment Clause 145 removes section 57 of the Partnership Act 1908. This section states that a special partnership cannot be formed for a period longer than seven years, at which point in time it may be renewed. The objective behind this change was to update the legislation to reflect the normal life of venture capital funds (which generally exist for 10 to 15 years). However, the Ministry of Economic Development has advised that it believes this clause should be removed from the bill. This is because the removal of the whole of section 57 would create some ambiguity and would require the courts to infer (on reading section 58, which talks about certificates of renewal) that the government intended to retain the right to renew the partnership. There are also other references to time limits, registration and dissolution, such as sections 51(f), 54 and 62, which would need to be amended or removed to ensure the government’s intention to remove any time restrictions on the duration of special partnerships was clear. As section 48 prevents any of Part 1 applying to Part 2 unless specifically stated in Part 2, general provisions detailing circumstances for dissolution of the partnership will not apply to special partnerships. The Ministry of Economic Development will reconsider the best way to achieve the government’s intent as part of its review of special partnerships and will make the required changes in its bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 32 33 Disputes resolution 34 35 OVERVIEW Clauses 9, 34, 70, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 95, 97, 99, 102, 104, 129, 134, 141, 143 and 144 The main objective of the disputes process is to have legislation and administrative practices which encourage disputes to be dealt with fairly, efficiently and quickly, before they get to court. As part of the generic tax policy process, a post-implementation review of the disputes process was undertaken, resulting in the July 2003 discussion document Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review. Following the review, the amendments proposed in the bill seek to further improve the framework within which tax disputes are resolved, to ensure that the process is meeting its objectives. This includes ensuring that legislated time-frames provide a balance between the government’s and taxpayers’ interests. The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps prescribed in legislation, the main elements of which are: • A notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). This is a notice by either the Commissioner or a taxpayer to the other that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s self-assessment. • A notice of response (NOR). The NOR is a notice of response issued by the party receiving the NOPA if they disagree with the NOPA. • A disclosure notice and statement of position (SOP). A disclosure notice triggers the issue of an SOP. An SOP contains the detailed facts and legal arguments to support the position taken and again is issued by both parties. It is an important document because it limits the parties to their respective facts and arguments if the case goes to court – this limitation is referred to as the “evidence exclusion rule”. The prescribed documents are intended to encourage an all “cards on the table” approach to dispute resolution that ensures that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court. There are also two administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. The conference is a relatively formal meeting between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer which aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. Adjudication involves the independent consideration of the dispute by Inland Revenue and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer’s assessment is amended. The process is set out in the diagrams on pages 38 and 39. 36 Key features of the proposed amendments Completing the process Proposed amendments which ensure that the various steps required to facilitate the resolution of a dispute are completed as the legislation intended include: • clarifying that the Commissioner must, other than in prescribed circumstances, apply all the legislated steps of a dispute (proposed new section 89N, Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)); • replacing the current six-month period within which the parties may agree to extend the time available for a dispute with a 12-month period (section 108B); and • expanding the circumstances in which a document that is provided late by the taxpayer will be accepted by the Commissioner (amending section 89K). Ensuring the process is efficient and cost-effective To ensure that the disputes resolution process is accessible to taxpayers, the costs incurred in preparing the various documents should be no greater than is necessary for each particular case. Amendments aimed at achieving this objective include: • simplifying the documentation required by both parties to progress a dispute (amended sections 89F and 89G); • requiring a more detailed document where a NOPA is issued by a taxpayer; • extending the time for taxpayers to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment from two months to four months (amendment to the definition of “response period” in the TAA); • introducing an accessible small claims process which includes raising the threshold for such cases from $15,000 to $30,000 and clarifying that a “precedent” case is one that has wider implications for other taxpayers (sections 13B of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, 89E of the TAA and regulation 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998); and • allowing the disputes process to be stayed pending the outcome of a test case if both parties agree (proposed new section 89O). Providing time-frames which balance government’s and taxpayers’ interests The provision of time-frames is necessary to balance the government’s need to manage revenue risk and the taxpayers need to ensure that their tax is correctly paid. To achieve this, the time-frames within which tax refunds are allowed (sections MD 1(1)and MD 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 45 of the GST Act) are being amended to provide for a four-year rather than an eight-year refund period, unless the taxpayer has made a clear mistake or simple oversight, where the period will remain eight years. 37 If a taxpayer is retrospectively claiming a GST input tax deduction in circumstances where the issue may be more complex and/or disputable – for example, one arising from new case law or a new interpretation that the taxpayer had not previously considered – a period of two years will be allowed. A taxpayer’s currently unlimited ability to claim an input tax credit in a current period return relating to a past transaction will be retained for straightforward cases, such as those involving a clear mistake or simple oversight. Submissions Twelve submissions were made on the various clauses in the bill relating to the review of the disputes process. Five submissions supported the improvements made to the disputes process but considered that the amendments did not go far enough. Five submissions noted that the amendments did not address taxpayers’ concerns and that the proposals weighed heavily in favour of Inland Revenue rather than taxpayers. One commented generally on the disputes resolution process, and the rest of the submissions made specific recommendations to further improve the amendments. 38 Commissioner-initiated dispute Taxpayer who is required to file return must make an assessment CIR issues NOPA? s 89B(1) May elect small claims jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authority Taxpayer issues NOR rejecting NOPA s 89G(1)?

Under proposed section 89N what is meant is that the issue of the Commissioner’s SOP and taxpayer’s SOP plus consideration of the taxpayer’s SOP will occur. This is not clear in the legislation. Comment The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which to amend a taxpayer’s assessment following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In the case of a dispute the assessment is amended following the process for resolving disputes. The intention at the time the legislation was introduced was that the various steps involved in the process would be undertaken within the four-year period. Owing to the manner in which it has been possible to apply the disputes process, the various steps in the process have not been completed as the legislation intended in all cases. To address this, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be required to follow the legislated steps of the disputes process, other than in specific circumstances. The policy intent is that both the taxpayer and Commissioner SOPs should be issued and considered within the four-year period and this is what is meant by “completing the process”. Submissions note that it is not clear whether completing the disputes process includes the consideration by the Commissioner of the taxpayer’s SOP, issued in response to the Commissioner’s SOP. Officials agree that this should be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 41 Issue: Lack of time-frames on the Commissioner Submissions (13 – Jeff Owens & Company, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 27 – KPMG) Submissions state that the objectives of the disputes process will never be achieved while Inland Revenue has unlimited time in which to deliver on its own objectives. A fundamental fault with the disputes regime is that the legislation imposes deadlines on taxpayers at every stage of the process, but there is no deadline on the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice in a taxpayer-initiated dispute or to issue a SOP in a Commissioner-initiated dispute. The justification for the lack of time-frames ignores important points: • Disputes can, and do, drag on for years. • The main reason taxpayers would like a legislated time-frame is not to gain assurance as to progress, it is to have disputes resolved in a timely manner. • Administrative methods of progress are ineffectual. • It would be a measure of good faith on the part of Inland Revenue if they showed some willingness to be subject to the same, or similar, time-frames. Inland Revenue has assured taxpayers that administrative improvements and guidelines will effectively mean the Inland Revenue will be working to set time limits internally. The submitters are not convinced that administrative time limits will work. Submissions request that both Inland Revenue Policy and Operations provide the select committee with reasons why such statutory time-frames are unacceptable and advise how Inland Revenue proposes to improve its administration of tax disputes. There is concern that without a legislative requirement, such promised improvements will either never be made or will not be maintained. Comment The main reason that the legislation does not prescribe a time-frame for SOPs initiated by the Commissioner is that there needs to be adequate time allowed to determine whether the issue is able to be resolved before litigation. This includes allowing sufficient time for the conference phase, which is an important administrative part of the disputes process. In an efficiently managed case, excessively rigid time-frames may signal to the taxpayer that Inland Revenue is focused on meeting the statutory phases of the dispute rather than on taking the time to actually resolve it. 42 Although introducing more time limits at the SOP stage would provide taxpayers with more assurance as to how their dispute is progressing, this can also be achieved administratively through greater contact with the taxpayer and the provision of guidelines as to likely time-frames. This is the current practice adopted by Inland Revenue in its standard practice statement (INV-170). Further, the proposal requiring the Commissioner to complete the disputes process means that the SOP phase must be completed within four years from the return filing date. This in itself ensures that disputes are managed in a timely manner, and that audits are started and completed earlier. The ability to agree to a time bar waiver for 12 months then provides for the dispute to go through the adjudication phase, if this has not been completed within the four years. These changes already aim to enhance the timeliness of disputes and Inland Revenue will need time to adapt to these changes. For this reason alone, officials do not recommend legislating a time-frame for SOPs, even if that were an appropriate policy outcome. Operational processes are continually being improved to ensure disputes are administered efficiently. Changes to internal processes have been implemented or are in the process of being developed, to address issues raised in the Office of the Controller and Auditor General’s report on the performance of taxpayer audit (July 2003). For example, Inland Revenue is currently reviewing its case management requirements, with the aim of introducing a new case management system across the organisation. Taxpayer audit is one of the first areas of focus. This will improve the management of disputes. Note that Inland Revenue has to meet external performance standards agreed to with the government, of which timely completion of the disputes process is one. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Alternative proposal: There should be a statutory time limit requiring Inland Revenue to start and complete audits within a time-frame to ensure that the disputes process is completed Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Inland Revenue takes too long to start and then complete audits, which affects the department’s ability to complete the disputes process within the required four-year period. Legislative amendments that impose statutory time limits requiring Inland Revenue to start and complete audits faster and more efficiently would be the preferred approach. 43 Comment Officials consider that the proposal that disputes reach the SOP phase, except in certain specified circumstances, before the four-year time bar, in effect ensures that audits are started and completed earlier in the process. An additional requirement may not be able to be managed administratively without causing a revenue risk – for example, through Inland Revenue being unable to investigate a complex issue across a wide range of taxpayers within the available time-frame. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Reference to adjudication should be inserted into the legislation Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments do not achieve the objective of ensuring that the disputes process be completed. This is because there is no requirement to complete the adjudication phase. These requirements must be in the legislation. A simple reference in new section 89N(2) to “including adjudication phase as carried out by the Commissioner” should be sufficient. Comment When the current disputes process was introduced it was envisaged that the adjudication function would be separate from Inland Revenue’s audit function and would have as its purpose “...the provision of an impartial application of tax law and a greater application of technical expertise to the affairs of taxpayers prior to the issue of an assessment.” 1 Submissions view the present adjudication function as a beneficial and positive aspect of the disputes process. They therefore consider that the Commissioner should ensure that disputes have the opportunity to proceed to adjudication. Officials agree with this view. However, legislating a requirement for adjudication is only one option for ensuring this. Another option, as proposed in the bill, is to provide a framework to ensure that there is sufficient time for referral to adjudication to occur administratively. 1 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department; Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994, p 67. 44 The adjudication follows the issue of SOPs in the disputes process. It is proposed that the SOP phase must be completed before an assessment is able to be issued (except in certain prescribed circumstances). The time-frame for the Commissioner to amend an assessment is four years from the date the return is filed. Inland Revenue will need to ensure that the adjudication process is able to be completed within the four-year period. However, the legislative requirement to follow the process to the SOP phase will in some cases place more pressure on the time for the adjudication phase. Hence an extension to the time bar waiver has been recommended. The current time bar waiver allows the parties to agree, if the four-year period for issuing an assessment is about to expire, to extend the four-year period by six months. The period proposed is 12 months. This should ensure that there is sufficient time for disputes to proceed to adjudication, if adjudication has not been completed in time. This alternative approach effectively achieves the same result but removes difficulties which officials consider are likely to arise from the submissions’ approach such as: • The adjudication function will need to be defined. Even if this is done broadly there will need to be reference to such terms as “impartial” or “independent” which will in themselves give rise to disputes. • Even at a broad level the functions of adjudication will need to be set out and this will need some consideration – for example, would the function be a final decision-making one and, if so, in what form would the final decision be conveyed? • Presumably, time-frames for completing an adjudication would need to be considered. Given the complexity of many of the cases that are currently referred to adjudication, it would be important to ensure that a revenue risk did not arise because insufficient time was available to complete the adjudication. As noted above, officials’ view is that the time needed to ensure this is the four- year period for assessments and a further 12-month waiver period. That would suggest that, if the adjudication function were legislated, the time bar on the Commissioner would need to be extended to five years. A change of this nature would require analysis and consultation beyond the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 45 Issue: Adjudication should be legislatively provided for and a time limit placed on the issue of the adjudication report Submissions (13 – Jeff Owens & Company) The adjudication unit in Inland Revenue should be required to issue a ruling within two months. Adjudication takes too long despite the Taxation Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3, August 1996 stating that an “adjudicator’s decision will be made within 4-6 weeks, this could be longer, or shorter depending on how complex the case is.” Such time-frames should be put on hold during any period in which Inland Revenue has made a reasonable request for information from the taxpayer and is waiting for a response. Comment Adjudication’s role is to consider the correct application of the law and determine whether the facts of the case meet the requirements of the legislation. Adjudication brings an impartial fresh perspective to the dispute and is independent of Inland Revenue’s audit function. The adjudicator considers carefully every argument put forward before reaching a conclusion. Therefore it is difficult to place a time limit on the production of the adjudicator’s report, as this can be affected by factors such as the complexity of the case and the amount of information contained in the files sent to adjudication. As reflected in the comments on the previous submission, to ensure that the adjudication was able to be completed within a set time-frame a period of 12 months would be required. However, in order to place a time-frame on adjudication it would be necessary to first define adjudication legislatively and, for the reasons given, officials do not support this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 Issue: Other parts of the disputes process must be completed at least six months prior to the four-year time bar to allow for adjudication Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society) Alternatively, if the legislative provision of adjudication is not accepted there should be provision that the other parts of the disputes process must be completed at least six months prior to the time bar. This would allow time for Inland Revenue’s administrative requirements to be completed. Comment The proposed section 89N, states that the Commissioner must complete the disputes process – except in certain circumstances – before an assessment is issued. This places an onus on Inland Revenue to ensure that there is enough time to complete the disputes process. As noted in the previous comments, the new 12-month time bar waiver period aims to ensure that the adjudication process is also completed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: New section 89N – what constitutes a “failure to provide information requested” Clause 84 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) Clarification is required in proposed section 89N(1)(c)(vi) – one of the exceptions to the requirement to follow the full legislated process – as to what constitutes a failure to provide information. This limb should be invoked only where the taxpayer has failed to comply within a reasonable time-frame that the taxpayer has accepted in writing. If no clarification is provided, Inland Revenue will be empowered to determine subjectively whether or not a taxpayer has complied with a request. There is a risk that an investigator may incorrectly claim that information is being withheld. Comment In order to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach to dispute resolution that ensures that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed, Inland Revenue requires information from the taxpayer. 47 Generally, information is provided voluntarily to Inland Revenue. However, in situations where this does not occur a statutory power (usually in the form of a notice under section 17 of the TAA) will be invoked in order to obtain the information. The formal request will generally set out the time within which the information must be provided. Draft paragraph (vi) is intended to address a failure to comply with this type of request for information in circumstances where the specified time limit has not been met. Therefore the paragraph should be clarified to ensure that it applies only in this situation. This should address the submissions’ concern. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: New section 89N – what constitutes a “request under a statute for information”? Clause 84 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) Clarification is required in section 89N(1)(c)(vi) as to what constitutes “a request under a statute for information” as the current wording appears to provide an extremely wide exception to the full disputes process requirement. It is unclear whether any information requested by Inland Revenue will arguably be pursuant to delegated authority and therefore a request under a statute. Comment A request under a statute by the Commissioner refers to any section under the Revenue Acts administered by the Commissioner which provides the ability to request that information be provided. The proposed wording is not excessively wide as it is naturally limited to a statutory provision such as section 17 that allows the Commissioner to request information. The request is also limited to information that relates to the dispute. It is therefore unnecessary to list particular sections. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 Issue: New section 89N – the ability to apply to the High Court should be removed Clause 84 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) There is no need for the clause allowing the Commissioner to go to the High Court as an exception to the requirement to follow the full legislated process. The section should be deleted. Comment The section is necessary to cater for situations where the Commissioner considers that there are reasonable grounds, other than those specifically prescribed, for not following the full statutory process. It is envisaged that the exception will be used only in exceptional circumstances. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New section 89N – in what circumstances can the Commissioner apply to the High Court for an order to either issue an assessment, or complete the process? Clause 84 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clarification is needed as to the circumstances in which the Commissioner can apply under section 89N(3) to the High Court. It should also be clarified that taxpayers will have a right to appear in such hearings and appeal in any such proceedings. The TAA should prescribe the circumstances in which Inland Revenue may exercise this power. This course of action should only be available in very exceptional circumstances. In considering an application under proposed section 89N(3), regard should be had to the provisions of sections 89A and 89N, the conduct of the parties to the dispute and the purpose of the time bar in section 108 of the TAA. 49 Comment It is envisaged that the exception to apply to the High Court for an order to issue an assessment or to allow further time to complete the process will be used only in exceptional circumstances. It is intended that the section will cover broadly similar situations already listed in the proposed new section which provide a schematic constraint to its application. The High Court in Sweetline Distributors Ltd & Ors v CIR, High Court Wellington, CIV 2001-485-712, CP 107/01 confirmed that an assessment issued without completing the disputes process is valid and necessary in order to discharge the Commissioner’s duty to ensure that the highest net revenue is collected in the public interest. This decision provides some guidance for Inland Revenue and taxpayers as to when it will be appropriate for Inland Revenue to approach the High Court for an order. The process of applying to the High Court for an order is governed by the High Court Rules, not the disputes legislation and normal appeal rights exist, including the ability of the other party to appear at the hearing. Therefore officials do not agree that the circumstances in which the provision will be used needs to be detailed in the legislation. Officials do consider, however, that some guidance on the point should be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin or Standard Practice Statement. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New section 89N(3) – the time bar should be suspended when the Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to either issue an assessment, or complete the process Clause 84 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 89N(3) provides for the ability for the Commissioner to apply to the High Court for an order to issue an assessment or to complete the process. In situations where the Commissioner must act quickly and the time bar is imminent, it is necessary to suspend the 4-year time bar if an application is made under this section to ensure the court has the time to act accordingly. 50 Comment Officials consider that when an application is made the 4-year time bar should be suspended until such time as the assessment is issued, the process is completed (as directed by the court), or the dispute is otherwise resolved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 89N – incorrect reference to associated person provision Clause 84 Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society) The exception that refers to the associated persons provision is inappropriate. The proposal refers to section OD 8(3). This is a wide section. In a domestic context section OD 7 provides an appropriate test for associated persons. Comment Officials consider that section OD 7 is not an appropriate associated persons provision to use in this context as it has a number of shortcomings, including not having a test for the trustee and beneficiary relationship; the definition in OD 8(3) includes this test. There are many examples of the section OD 8(3) associated persons definition being used in a domestic context – for example, in all the depreciation provisions. Current drafting practice is to refer to section OD 8(3) rather than section OD 7 until such time as the associated person definitions are reviewed as a separate project. Therefore officials consider that the use of the section OD 8(3) definition is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 Issue: New section 89N – reference to “criminal matter” should be defined Clause 84 Submission (27 – KPMG) Allegations of a “criminal matter” in section 89N(1)(c)(i) – one of the exceptions to the requirement to follow the full legislated disputes process – should be defined. It is unclear what this means. The dispute could involve allegations of a criminal nature simply because the taxpayer was being assessed for the proceeds of crime. Comment The exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment where criminal activities are alleged. Therefore officials agree that the application of the section should be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 89N – judicial review proceedings Clause 84 Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 15 PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It is inappropriate that Inland Revenue is not required to complete the full disputes process where a taxpayer has chosen to bring judicial review proceedings. As suggested in the discussion document, the exception for judicial review should not apply to judicial review proceedings initiated in relation to the time-bar. Comment The exception relating to judicial review proceedings reflects that the parties’ resources may be directed away from progressing the dispute through the disputes process towards addressing the facts and issues in the judicial review application. The exception applies to all judicial review proceedings brought against the Commissioner. 52 Officials consider that this is an appropriate reason to issue an assessment without completing the full disputes process. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: New section 89N – the word “delay” should be removed Clause 84 Submission (27 – KPMG) The word “delay” should be removed from 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii). These paragraphs provide for the ability to issue an assessment without following the full legislated process if the Commissioner considers the taxpayer or an associated person of the taxpayer has taken steps as to the existence of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the payment of tax. The exception is reasonable if the intent is to avoid paying tax. It is unnecessary to also include the word “delay”. It is not clear what it means. Comment The purpose of the provision is to address situations where a taxpayer or associated person of the taxpayer seeks to dispose of assets which may be required to meet an outstanding tax liability, and the issue of an assessment becomes urgent. Officials consider that the meaning of the word “delay” can be determined by reference to its context in the proposed provision. To provide that the taxpayer has taken steps to avoid or delay means that it is not necessary that Inland Revenue prove that the taxpayer acted to ensure that the tax was never paid. This would often be very difficult to determine. It is therefore appropriate that the provision apply if the taxpayer sought to avoid or delay the payment of tax by taking steps in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer’s assets. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: Provision should be made to allow taxpayers to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society) Taxpayers should be able to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process and go directly to court. Otherwise they may be required to invest a considerable amount of resource in the NOPA/SOP phase, with the taxpayer receiving no benefit. Comment One of the reasons the Organisational Review recommended that Inland Revenue needed a new comprehensive approach to resolving tax disputes was because many disputes went to court that could and should have been settled by discussion and full disclosure of the factual basis for argument. 2 The current disputes process therefore aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court. Officials consider that giving taxpayers the ability to opt out of the disputes process unilaterally would defeat the purpose of the disputes process. In practical terms it would mean deferring the costs of a dispute to the litigation stage and potentially adding to the time and costs involved in a court hearing. There could be further additional costs if the court had to refer the case back to the parties – for example, to agree on the facts. 3 Officials do consider, however, that the disputes process needs to cater for all taxpayers and that there should therefore be an appropriate balance between ensuring the process is completed as was intended and that the costs of the process do not outweigh the amount of money in dispute. The bill therefore proposes two exceptions to completing the disputes process in smaller or more straightforward cases. First, the Commissioner and the taxpayer can agree to opt out of the process for any dispute. This would occur – for example, if the compliance and administrative costs that the parties might incur in completing the full disputes process would be excessive relative to the amount in dispute. Secondly, the taxpayer may elect, instead of having the full process, to have the dispute heard by the Taxation Review Authority acting in its small claims jurisdiction. The threshold for small claims has been increased from $15,000 to $30,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 2 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee, April 1994. P 67. 3 See, for example, Alpe v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,372. 54 THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED AS PART OF THE DISPUTES PROCESS Issue: The amount of detail required in the taxpayer NOPA should not be more than the detail required in a Commissioner NOPA Clause 80 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) There should not be a difference in the standards of detail required between taxpayer- initiated NOPAs and Inland Revenue-initiated NOPAs, as contained in proposed section 89F. The level of detail in a taxpayer-initiated NOPA should be self-policing as the taxpayer knows sufficient information needs to be provided. To have a legislative difference in levels of detail risks taxpayers being accused of providing invalid NOPAs when the focus should be on the substantive merits of the taxpayer’s NOPA. Comment Officials do not consider that a comparison between the detail required in a Commissioner NOPA and that required in a taxpayer NOPA is necessarily helpful since the two documents have quite separate functions. In general terms, less information should be required in a Commissioner NOPA because the taxpayer will know the background to the issued raised. In comparison, a taxpayer NOPA will very often contain the only information available to the Commissioner in respect of the issue raised. One of the main reasons taxpayers may choose to initiate a NOPA is to eliminate their exposure to shortfall penalties. At present, a taxpayer can file a return on a conservative basis and then raise a potentially more arguable issue arising from their return separately by way of a taxpayer NOPA. As penalties are calculated by reference to the tax position taken in a return (or self-assessment), rather than in a NOPA, the risk of shortfall penalties applying is removed. The purpose of requiring the taxpayer to provide more information in their NOPA is essentially to treat the document as if it were an investigation by the taxpayer of their own return. This will ensure that the taxpayer has fully considered an issue before raising it in a NOPA. It will also reduce administrative and compliance costs since, because of the greater level of detail that will be required, potential disputes may be able to be resolved at an earlier stage (ideally without the need for further investigation). 55 The growing use of the taxpayer-initiated NOPA may place pressure on Inland Revenue’s resources, particularly given the constraints of the two-month period to issue a notice of response. Therefore it is important that this process be managed as efficiently as possible. Compliance costs will also be reduced for taxpayers if Inland Revenue does not need to continuously seek further information from them. Officials note that, because of the potentially greater level of information that will be required in a taxpayer NOPA, taxpayers will be given four months, instead of the current two months, to provide the NOPA. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Detailed amendments to taxpayer NOPA if preceding submission not addressed Clause 80 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 89F(3)(a) should only refer to “a clear statement of the facts” rather than “clear and detailed...”. The reference to “detailed” risks being seen as requiring unnecessary levels of detail and will simply increase compliance costs on taxpayers. Comment The objective of the NOPA and NOR documents is to ensure that, where possible, enough information is provided to resolve a dispute at an early stage. The taxpayer should therefore provide enough information to ensure that the Commissioner is either able to respond to the NOPA or to agree to the adjustment. However, taxpayers should not incur unnecessary costs in doing so. Officials agree that the requirement that the statement of the facts and law be “detailed” should be removed. However, to ensure that disputes are resolved as quickly as possible, officials recommend that the taxpayer provide a “clear and complete statement of the facts and law that the taxpayer considers make the adjustment necessary”. This would reduce the submissions’ concerns with compliance costs but at the same time provide the information necessary for the Commissioner to consider the taxpayer NOPA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, in that the word “detailed” be removed from proposed section 89F(3)(a) and replaced with the word “complete” or a similar term. 56 Issue: To provide all material documentary evidence in a taxpayer NOPA is unnecessary Clause 80 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) There should not be a requirement for a taxpayer to attach all material documentary evidence to a taxpayer-initiated NOPA. Comment The requirement that a taxpayer attach all material documentary evidence to a taxpayer NOPA ensures that the Commissioner has all the information necessary to respond to the NOPA. If the information is adequate to support the adjustment then it is less likely that the Commissioner will need to investigate the adjustment further. This will facilitate a speedy resolution to the dispute. However, officials acknowledge that there are compliance costs associated with taxpayers ensuring they provide all the material documentary evidence. In response to this concern, new section 89F should be amended to state that the taxpayer is required to supply the “key” (or similar) documentary evidence materially relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the taxpayer, rather than all documentary evidence. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify that a taxpayer NOPA must identify the adjustment or adjustments made to a disputable decision Clause 80 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section 89F(3) setting out the content of a taxpayer NOPA should contain a requirement to ensure the taxpayer identifies the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to a disputable decision. 57 Comment A NOPA issued by the Commissioner must identify the adjustment or adjustments that must be made to the assessment. The proposed new section does not clearly provide that taxpayers must identify the adjustment in their NOPAs. Officials recommend that a similar reference be included in the requirements for a taxpayer NOPA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Detailed amendment to NOR Clause 81 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 89G(2)(e) requires that the issuer of the NOR indicate by how much the figure referred to in the NOPA is incorrect. The current wording assumes that the quantitative adjustments will be easy to calculate. “Likely to result” should be inserted to introduce a degree of flexibility. Comment One of the requirements of the NOR is that the taxpayer and the Commissioner must state concisely an adjustment to any figure referred to in the NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments relied on by the issuer of the NOR. This proposal ensures that the NOR is a meaningful document that responds fully to the NOPA. There is no requirement that the amount referred to be final. One of the objectives of the steps in the process – especially the NOPA and NOR phase – is to achieve a level of disclosure of relevant information and discussion between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. As the dispute progresses, the amount in dispute may be altered reflecting the outcome of, for example, a conference or other discussions between the parties. The quantitative adjustment requirement merely establishes, in the issuer of the NOR’s opinion, by how much the adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. Officials consider that the remaining steps in the disputes process in themselves provide the flexibility for this quantification to change. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 58 THE FOUR-MONTH TAXPAYER NOPA PERIOD Issue: Support for proposal Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 70 The proposed four-month period within which a taxpayer can issue a NOPA is better than the current two months and should be welcomed by taxpayers. Comment In recognition of concerns raised in submissions to the discussion document that more time is needed for taxpayers to issue NOPAs and the requirement on taxpayers to provide detailed information to the Commissioner when they initiate a dispute, it is proposed that the definition of “response period” in the TAA be amended to give taxpayers four months, instead of the current two months, to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Four-month NOPA period not long enough Clause 70 Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Four months is not long enough. Submissions prefer a 12-month period. Taxpayers do not generally undertake reviews of their tax returns within four months of the filing of the return. Errors are usually identified 12 months after the filing of a return. Comment In recognition of submissions on the discussion document that more time is needed for taxpayer-initiated disputes and the proposed requirement on taxpayers to provide complete information in the taxpayer NOPA, it is proposed to extend the current two month period to issue a taxpayer NOPA to four months. 59 However, any further time allowed in which to issue a taxpayer NOPA – for example, 12 months – greatly reduces Inland Revenue’s ability to manage the dispute through all the steps of the disputes process, within the four-year time bar. Therefore if the taxpayer NOPA period were extended to 12 months, the four-year time bar would need to be extended by a similar amount of time, which could significantly delay the issue of an assessment or resolution of the dispute. Extending the four-year time bar to five years would be inconsistent with the objective of attaining finality to an assessment within a reasonable period and would require full consultation beyond the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Ensure that the self-assessment date is clear Clause 92 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) Consideration needs to be given how the concept of “received at an office of the department” under section 92 and the time-frame for a taxpayer NOPA will work in practice. To ensure the date is known to taxpayers, the Commissioner should be required to print the date on the statement of account issued to the taxpayer that acknowledges the taxpayer’s assessment. Comment Inland Revenue practice is that on the date of receipt of the taxpayer’s assessment, the return is date stamped – electronically or manually – and it is this date that is entered into Inland Revenue’s FIRST system. Once this date is entered into the FIRST system, a return acknowledgment form is generated and sent to the taxpayer. Therefore the taxpayer will have a record of the date of receipt, and the date of self- assessment will be clear. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 60 TIME BAR WAIVER PROVISIONS Issue: Agreement must be in writing Clause 97 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The waiver under which the Commissioner and the taxpayer can agree to allow more time (up to 12 months) for a dispute to be resolved should be in writing. Comment The existing time bar waiver period of six months is problematic because in some cases six months is insufficient to complete the process. The proposal extends this six month waiver period to 12 months to provide sufficient time to complete the disputes process in cases where this extra time is needed. The proposal does not replace existing section 108B(2), which already provides that the waiver must be in the prescribed form and in writing. Therefore no further change is required as the submissions’ concerns are already addressed. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Clarify that the Commissioner must not raise new issues in the waiver period Clause 97 Submission (18 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) The wording of the amendment (that the Commissioner cannot raise new issues during the period of the waiver) in proposed section 108B(1B) needs to be explicit and state unequivocally that the Commissioner cannot raise any new issues during the period of the extension. 61 The wording should be amended to make it clear that the issues that Inland Revenue is limited to investigating are those that are currently the subject of dispute and are known to Inland Revenue and the taxpayer and also formally identified by both parties, prior to the waiver being granted. Comment The proposal to extend the waiver period to 12 months also provides that the Commissioner will not be able to raise new issues during the waiver period that are not identified and known to both parties before the start of the waiver period. This is intended to address concerns by both taxpayers and Inland Revenue that taxpayers have in the past been reluctant to grant the waiver because of the risk that Inland Revenue could raise new issues in the waiver period. Submissions consider that this requirement needs to be more clearly expressed in the draft legislation. Officials agree that some clarification is required to ensure that issues not already known and identified by both parties and to which the waiver applies are raised during the waiver period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: The taxpayer should be able to further extend the waiver period Clause 97 Submission (27 – KPMG) The taxpayer should be able to agree to further extend the waiver period if that is desired. The rules should allow further extensions in blocks of six months if agreement is reached. Comment Officials consider that the taxpayer should be able to extend the proposed 12-month time bar waiver by a further six month period. While Inland Revenue considers that this additional time would rarely, if ever, be required, taxpayers may, for example, want more certainty that if a case has gone to adjudication and the time (including the additional 12 months) expires the adjudication can still be finalised. The additional waiver period would not need to be agreed with Inland Revenue. 62 However, allowing ongoing six-month extension periods would be inconsistent with the objective of resolving disputes promptly. Therefore a further extension should be limited to a single six-month period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by allowing taxpayers to extend the proposed time bar waiver by a further six months. 63 EXCEPTIONS TO THE FOUR-YEAR STATUTORY TIME BAR Clause 95 Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 18 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society, 27 – KPMG) It is strongly recommended that the proposed changes to section 108(2) relating to the exception to the four-year time bar for the Commissioner to issue an amended assessment be removed from the bill. The existence of a period within which a citizen or taxpayer is at risk of inquiry and/or interference by the state is a fundamental constitutional issue. The length of the period in which the Commissioner can reopen an assessment and the grounds entitling him to do so must reflect the seriousness of the breach by the taxpayer. The proposed extension of the time bar override provisions to instances where the taxpayer materially overstates the amount of an allowable deduction is of a fundamentally different context to the earlier exceptions. There is no suggestion of the presence of any impropriety by the taxpayer (which arguably underlies the other exceptions to the time bar rules), merely the requirement that there exists an adjustable error in the filed tax return. This means the Commissioner could theoretically re-open a previously statute-barred return as a result of a court decision on the deductibility of a particular expenditure item that is decided many years later in the Commissioner’s favour. In all cases, Inland Revenue should have the ability to re-open a tax return only after the expiry of the four year statute bar where there has been misconduct on the part of the taxpayer. In addition, interpretation of the term “material” is likely to be problematic. Comment An assessment can currently be amended at any time if the return provided by the taxpayer is: • fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or • does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. On a literal interpretation, the assessment could be amended in the second situation regardless of whether or not it was the taxpayer’s intention to omit gross income. However, as has been suggested by the courts, the section will operate effectively only if Inland Revenue applies it having regard to the behaviour of the taxpayer and the amount of tax at stake. 64 While the current legislation refers to omission of income, it does not address a range of other aspects inherent in the calculation of a taxpayer’s tax liability, such as the overstatement of deductions. The proposed amendment is intended to overcome both these deficiencies. Regarding the issues raised in submissions, officials note that omitting income of a particular nature or source is not necessarily worse in terms of intent than materially overstating deductions. Under the current legislation if a taxpayer materially omits income from a return, the time bar exception will apply. But if a taxpayer materially overstates an expense claim or tax deduction in a tax return, the exception to the four- year period may not apply, even though the overstatement is material and might, in certain situations, be classed as tax avoidance. This inconsistency needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, officials note the concern that the amendments extending the circumstances in which the statute bar can be overridden may be too broad and that there may be uncertainty about how the materiality test would be applied. Therefore officials consider that the amendments should be removed from the bill for further consultation at a later date. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted by removing the amendments from the bill for further consideration at a later date. 65 TIME-FRAMES FOR REFUNDS OF EXCESS TAX Clauses 34 and 134 Submission (3 – National Council of Women, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The amendments to sections MD 1(1) and MD 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 45 of the GST Act (the refund provisions) represent a fundamental diminution in taxpayers’ rights to claim refunds of overpaid tax since: • if taxpayers have overpaid their tax they should be entitled to a refund; and • the Inland Revenue, as administrator of the tax laws, must fulfil its obligations within a reasonable time-frame in order to provide certainty. The legislative presumption should be to allow taxpayers an adjustment for overpaid tax as of right unless there is a good reason for its denial. The passage of time does not constitute sufficiently solid grounds to deny a refund. The proposal is grossly inequitable and contrary to the spirit of the disputes process. Taxpayers should be entitled to a refund of overpaid tax as a fundamental right, and reducing the refund window is tantamount to a tax increase. Therefore the amendments should be removed. Comment Officials consider that there should be no difference between the time-frame within which the Commissioner can increase a taxpayer’s assessment, and the time taxpayers have to decrease their assessments. The rationale for the time limit is the same – to provide certainty for the taxpayer and the government. However, for historical reasons, taxpayers have eight years to claim a refund. The long period for refunds was established in the 1950s, in an era when the administrative environment was based on assessments made by the Commissioner. The eight-year refund period is too long in the current tax environment, which aims to achieve certainty for taxpayers and the government at the earliest practicable stage. By comparison, for Inland Revenue, the longest period generally allowed for any issue to be identified and resolved is four years from the end of the income year in which the taxpayer’s return is filed. This is anomalous. 66 The eight-year period creates an unquantifiable revenue risk from backdated claims for overpaid taxes. This is not a significant concern in cases where the taxpayer has a clear entitlement to the refund. However, where the claim arises because of new case law or a new interpretation, substantial claims and a consequent revenue loss could result. The objective of the proposals is to protect the revenue base from large, unexpected tax refund claims and to ensure that time-frames provide the certainty for taxpayers and the government that is consistent with the objectives of administrative efficiency and equity. Therefore the refund provisions are being amended to limit the eight-year refund period to four years, with the Commissioner being able, in the case of clear mistakes and simple oversights, and for rebate claims, to extend the period to eight years. Retaining the eight-year period in these cases protects the taxpayer’s ability to claim refunds in clear cases. Officials note that restrictive time limits on claiming GST refunds have been introduced in overseas jurisdictions. Canada reduced the four-year time limit to claim a GST refund to two years in 1997. The United Kingdom reduced the six-year GST refund period to three years also in 1997. In comparison, a four-year limit in which to claim a GST refund applies in Australia. Further, the United Kingdom and Australia have an “unjust enrichment” provision which means if it is unlikely that the GST refund will be passed on to the recipient, the refund will be denied on the basis that it will result in a windfall gain to the supplier. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Alternative submission: The amendments should refer to “mistake or oversight” Clauses 34 and 134 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) If the previous submission is not accepted, the refund provisions should be amended to refer to “mistake or oversight”, not “clear mistake or simple oversight.” The words “clear” and “simple” create subjective uncertainty. If these words are retained, Inland Revenue would need to give adequate examples and clarification in a Standard Practice Statement on Inland Revenue’s view of these words. 67 Comment Officials consider that the words “clear mistake or simple oversight” should remain in the legislation. The objective of the wording is to distinguish between inadvertent miscalculation, and actively seeking to minimise tax liability, for example, as a result of a beneficial new interpretation or favourable new case law. However, officials agree that a Standard Practice Statement to guide taxpayers and Inland Revenue as to the correct interpretation of the terms should be issued. Examples of what could constitute “clear mistake or simple oversight” would include arithmetical errors, or inadvertently including in gross income the same item twice. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: The refund section needs to clarify that a refund claimed, but not received, before the end of the period can be issued to the taxpayer Clauses 34 and 134 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposals to amend the refund provisions need to ensure that the time limitation does not apply if a refund is requested or the formal dispute mechanism has been invoked prior to the end of the refund period. Submissions are concerned that Inland Revenue will be able to enter the disputes resolution process with no prospect of having to refund monies incorrectly collected where the outcome of the dispute favours the taxpayer and the refund period has elapsed. Comment The refund provisions currently state that no refund may be made after eight years, unless written application for the refund is made by or on behalf of the taxpayer before the expiration of the period. Officials agree that there needs to be a reference in the proposed amendments similar to the existing wording referring to application for the refund before the expiration of the time bar. This ensures that in situations where a dispute which results in a refund is resolved close to the time bar payment can still be made after the time bar period if application of the refund was made before the expiration of the four-year time bar. 68 Proposed section 89N states that the disputes process must be completed within the four-year time bar, before an amended assessment can be issued. This, in effect, ensures that the Commissioner cannot invoke the disputes process prior to the end of the refund period in order to ensure that a taxpayer does not receive a refund. If the taxpayer challenges the amended assessment by going to court, section 138I(3) states that the Commissioner must, after the date of determination of final liability, refund the tax to the disputant if the challenge is successful. The four-year time bar to amend an assessment does not apply to a determination or assessment made by a court. Therefore the concern raised in submissions relates only to the Commissioner’s determination of an issue, not a determination by a court. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 69 CLAIMING GST INPUT TAX CREDITS Clauses 78 and 129 Issue: The status quo should remain (3 – National Council of Women, 9W (11W & 12W) – Toovey Eaton & McDonald, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 18 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 21 – New Zealand Law Society, 27 – KPMG) The status quo (that is, the unlimited time for claiming input tax credits for past periods in a current period return) should remain because taxpayers are entitled to rely on the principle that, if they are a registered person, they will receive an input tax credit in respect of GST costs they incur. The proposed amendment does not take into account time delays. While this process commonly takes days, rather than weeks, it is a significant issue for large, geographically spread organisations. Unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that the delay in claiming the input tax credit was due to clear mistake or simple oversight, the taxpayer cannot claim the credit in the current period return. In this respect the proposal erodes taxpayers’ rights and is contrary to the philosophy of GST, which is intended to be an agency tax borne by the final consumer. The changes as proposed are likely to affect taxpayer perceptions as to the integrity of the tax system. This will result in the taxpayer having to incur potentially significant compliance costs because the taxpayer will have to issue a NOPA. This is an unsatisfactory outcome. Comment Under the present legislation, taxpayers are able to claim in a current period return GST input tax credits which have not been previously deducted. The time within which these claims may be made is unspecified, but may be practically limited by the seven-year statutory period for which business records must be retained. Allowing adjustments to be made in the current period return prevents the compliance costs that taxpayers might otherwise face if they continually had to amend past returns. The proposal is to limit the circumstances in which a GST input tax credit can be claimed in the current period return to those situations where a tax invoice has not been able to be obtained or where there has been a clear mistake or simple oversight. If there is a more disputable GST input credit claim – for example, a claim based on arguments following favourable new case law or a beneficial new interpretation of the law, a two-year period within which the taxpayer must initiate a dispute to the GST return is proposed. 70 Retaining the unspecified period for claiming an input tax credit is not appropriate because the government is exposed to a significant but unquantifiable revenue risk from large, backdated refund claims on more complex issues where the legislation may not be clear. Also, the unspecified time period does not provide certainty for taxpayers and the government that is consistent with a modern tax administration. Therefore officials do not agree that the status quo should remain. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Alternative proposal: Provide for a two-year period for claiming an input tax credit with restrictions placed after that period Clauses 78 and 129 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, matter raised by officials) There should be an unqualified two-year period to claim an input tax credit from a prior GST period. Outside of that two-year period, an unlimited time period should be included where adjustments are required as a result of delay as well as clear mistake or simple oversight. Submissions also raise the concern that if a failure to claim an input tax credit is caused by a dispute over the supply itself (and consequent non-payment) the exceptions to the two-year period would not apply. Comment The proposals in the bill continue to allow an unlimited period to claim an input tax credit but only where the inability to claim the input tax credit has arisen owing to a clear mistake or simple oversight or the inability to obtain a tax invoice. Other situations are catered for through the ability to issue a taxpayer NOPA, the period for which is currently proposed to be extended to two years for GST input tax credit claims. The important issue raised by submissions is whether the two-year period should apply to current period returns or, as proposed, require the issue of a taxpayer NOPA. The latter approach is clearly more compliance-cost intensive. 71 Officials consider that an unqualified two-year period to claim an input tax credit in a current period return should be provided for in place of the proposal for a two-year NOPA period. This would address the concern raised in submissions that invoices may not be processed and approved until many months after their receipt. One submission noted that, especially for large, geographically spread organisations, it is common for invoices to be at least two or more months old before being processed and paid. In most of these cases, it is not oversight or mistake that has caused the delay and, under the proposal, the taxpayer would not be able to claim the invoice in a current period return. While officials consider that the situations raised by submissions should be addressed by a general two-year time-frame for current period adjustment, an unlimited period to claim input tax credits in situations caused by a delay for any reason is not warranted. Taxpayers would still be able to make claims after expiry of the two years which officials now propose –not just in a current period return. However, outside of this unqualified two-year period, an unlimited period to claim an input tax credit should (in addition to the situations involving clear mistake, simple oversight or the inability to obtain an invoice) be allowed if the failure to claim the refund has arisen because the taxpayer did not accept a liability to pay for a supply. But at a later date – for example, because a court decided the dispute in favour of the supplier – it was determined that the taxpayer did have a liability to pay. Officials therefore recommend that the proviso to section 20(3) be amended to allow for an unqualified two-year period to claim an input tax credit in a current period return, with an unlimited time for the specific situations mentioned above. The two- year period would apply from the time an invoice is issued (or payment if earlier). An unqualified two-year period to make adjustments in a current period return would also apply for more contentious claims. However, as taxpayers currently have the ability to make current year adjustments at any time, this does not give rise to any new revenue risk. The proposal contained in new section 89DA(1B) to provide for a two-year period in which to dispute a GST return will be replaced with the general four-month period for taxpayer NOPAs. Officials note that overseas jurisdictions have introduced strict time limits on the ability to claim input tax credits. Introducing time limits has been motivated by the fiscal risk of allowing large backdated refund claims that could result from the ability to claim an input tax credit at any time. Canada reduced the four-year time limit to claim an input tax credit to two years in 1997. The United Kingdom allows three years to claim an input tax credit in a current period return. In comparison, a four- year limit in which to claim an input tax credit applies in Australia. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by allowing an unqualified two-year period to make a current period input tax credit claim with an unlimited time for specific situations outside of that two-year period. 72 Alternative proposal: Ability to claim input tax credit outside of the two- year period Clause 129 Submission (Matter raised by the adviser to the Committee) A failure to claim an input tax credit could also arise outside of the two-year period if a supply, following an elapse of time, is found to be taxable and the related input tax credit has not been claimed. Comment As noted in the response to the preceding submissions the ability to claim an input tax credit outside of the proposed two-year period will be restricted to situations involving clear mistake, simple oversight, the inability to obtain an invoice or the resolution of a dispute. A further situation that should be included is where it is found – for example, by Inland Revenue following an audit – that a supply previously considered by the taxpayer to be exempt was taxable and, on the basis of the taxpayer’s earlier view, input tax credits relating to the GST costs incurred in making the supply had not been claimed. Officials consider that an unlimited time to claim an input tax credit in this specific situation should also be allowed. Recommendation That the adviser’s submission be accepted. Alternative proposals: 12-month time period to claim input tax credit or specify when a credit cannot be claimed Clauses 78 and 129 Submission (9W (11W & 12W) – Toovey Eaton & McDonald, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The existing proviso should be amended to allow claims for, say, 12 months after the invoice date. (Toovey Eaton & McDonald) Rather than requiring taxpayers to prove their entitlement to an input tax claim relating to a prior period, the rules should allow taxpayers an input tax deduction except in certain circumstances specifically tailored to address the fiscal risk. (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 73 Comment Officials consider that a 12-month period in which to claim an input tax credit may not be long enough in many situations. Legislating for situations where an input tax deduction would not be allowed would require excessive detail in the legislation. Therefore a two-year period, as discussed in the response to the submissions above, with the appropriate qualifications in place after that period, is more appropriate to address the concerns raised in submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 74 THE APPLICATION OF THE COMMISSIONER’S DISCRETION TO AMEND ASSESSMENTS – SECTION 113 Issue: Practical application of section 113 of the TAA Clause 99 Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 27 – KPMG) Assuming Inland Revenue agrees with the technical position in relation to correctness of the proposed adjustment for tax overpayments, Inland Revenue should reassess and correct the tax overpayments as well as the underpayments under section 113. While the proposed amendments in the bill do not directly change the legal position under this scenario, there is a concern that some Inland Revenue operations staff are unwilling to reassess in the case of tax overpayments but do not hesitate to reassess for underpayments. The select committee should request that Inland Revenue reconsider its policy regarding the application of section 113. The circumstances when a taxpayer can request an amended assessment under section 113 should be broadened to circumstances where: • The taxpayer has made a genuine and clear error in a tax return they have filed with Inland Revenue; and • Their request for an amended assessment under section 113 is made within the four year time bar. Section 113 should be amended to remove the Commissioner’s discretion to reopen an assessment if a taxpayer is able to show that the assessment imposes an income tax obligation above an amount correctly determined in accordance with the Revenue Acts. Comment Many provisions in the Revenue Acts reserve powers to the Commissioner. These powers are generally in the form of discretions allowing the Commissioner to carry out administrative duties, and make decisions regarding the affairs of individual taxpayers. The Commissioner’s function of administering the tax laws requires him to operate efficiently within prescribed time-frames so that, as far as it is practicable to achieve, taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. For this purpose the Commissioner must be able to use a discretion to amend assessments and to make default assessments whether or not those assessments favour the revenue or the taxpayer. Therefore the discretion to amend assessments under section 113 should remain. 75 Note, however, that section 113 is being amended to provide that the discretion be subject to section 89N in cases involving a dispute. Officials note that Standard Practice Statement INV 510 sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may exercise the discretion to amend assessments to ensure correctness. The statement was issued in August 2002, following external consultation throughout its development. The statement provides guidance for situations where genuine errors have been made and there is an agreed adjustment. Inland Revenue is undertaking a general review of its practices, in part to address concerns raised in the Office of the Controller and Auditor General’s report on the performance of taxpayer audit. The issue raised by submissions should therefore be considered as part of that review. Recommendation That the submission requesting legislative change be declined. That the submission requesting an operational review of section 113 be noted by Inland Revenue. Issue: If the preceding submission is not accepted, section 89D(5) should be amended to accept a late NOPA Submission (27 – KPMG) Section 89D(5) of the TAA provides that a NOPA issued by the taxpayer must be issued within the response period – currently two months. The rule in section 89D(5) of the TAA should be amended to allow the Commissioner to accept a NOPA outside of the response period. Comment The definition of “response period” is being amended to give taxpayers four months, instead of the current two months, to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment. Section 89K of the TAA gives the Commissioner a discretion to accept a late document where exceptional circumstances have prevented the taxpayer from providing the document on time. Section 89K is being amended to give the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late document outside of the applicable response period if the lateness is minimal – for example, if the document is filed one or two days late or the document is late owing to one or more statutory holidays falling within the response period. 76 Officials do not recommend any further extensions of the period within which taxpayers must issue a NOPA without extending other time-frames, most notably the four-year period for the Commissioner to amend an assessment. Officials consider that increasing the overall period for issuing an assessment would need to be widely consulted on as it is outside the scope of the bill and could be viewed as inconsistent with the objective of the disputes process to achieve early finality of the assessment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The inability of taxpayers to amend their self-assessment at any time Submission (27 – KPMG) Taxpayers should have the power to amend their assessments at any time since under self-assessment they are charged with making their assessment. Comment The ability of the Commissioner to amend an assessment is based on the requirement that the Commissioner collect the correct amount of tax. The four-year time period within which to increase an assessment and the discretion to consider reductions in liability raised by taxpayers ensures that this is achieved efficiently. If taxpayers had the ability to reconsider their own assessments at any time within the four-year period, it would mean that the Commissioner’s audit activities could begin only after the end of four years because any prior audit would be subject to taxpayer amendments. Therefore any increase in time for taxpayers to make adjustments would need to be matched by an increase in time for the Commissioner to audit those changes. Given that the Commissioner has four years to review returns, the Commissioner would need another four years to review an amendment made by the taxpayer. This would mean that if a taxpayer made an adjustment, there would be no final assessment until eight years after the return is furnished. This is contrary to the objective of the disputes process to achieve early resolution of disputes over tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Changes to the definition of “disputable decision” Clause 70 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If these proposals, which define the matters that may be brought under the disputes process, are enacted, disputants will no longer be able to challenge procedural decisions made by the Commissioner. It needs to be clarified that the government intends that these decisions would be open to court review through the judicial review process. The proposals appear to be an erosion of taxpayers’ rights. Comment The term “disputable decision” is defined in the TAA to mean an assessment and a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law. The definition also includes exceptions to what is a disputable decision. The proposal excludes from the definition of “disputable decision’ decisions left to the Commissioner’s discretion that occur specifically under the disputes legislation contained in Part IVA of the TAA. The amendments ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as “disputable decisions” and that mechanical sections of the disputes process do not in themselves give rise to disputes. The right to commence proceedings pursuant to the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 (judicial review) is not removed as the proposals do not affect that Act. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 78 Issue: Exceptional circumstances – section 89K Clause 82 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed amendment to extend the circumstances in which the taxpayer may file a late document should proceed. However, clarification is needed as to how the Commissioner’s discretion will apply to situations where statutory holidays fall within the response period. If there is a reluctance to be too prescriptive in the legislation guidance as to what is “minimal” could be provided by way of a standard practice statement. This approach is acceptable provided that Inland Revenue is reasonable in its approach. The same expanded definition should be used in sections 89L and 138D. Judicial review of the decision should be available to taxpayers but clarification that this is intended would be useful. Comment The Commissioner is able to accept a late document within the response period if exceptional circumstances apply. The current definition of “exceptional circumstance” is too restrictive and is, therefore, being extended. Section 89K is being amended to give the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late document outside of the applicable response period if the lateness is minimal or the document is late owing to one or more statutory holidays falling within the response period. Officials agree that a standard practice statement should be issued to provide guidance as to what is “minimal”. This would be expected to include at least that the document was one or two days late. Officials do not consider that it is appropriate to amend section 89L and 138D in the same manner as section 89K. This is because section 89L provides that the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an exception where the Commissioner considers exceptional circumstances apply. Section 138D applies when a hearing authority may hear a late challenge. In these situations, it is left to the discretion of the Court to determine if the exceptional circumstances the Commissioner considers apply are in fact justifiable reasons to allow a notice to be issued late. The right to commence proceedings pursuant to the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 (judicial review) is not removed as the proposals do not affect that Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 79 Issue: Section 114 – validity of assessments not affected by failure to comply with section 89N Clause 100 Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society, 27 – KPMG) The submissions consider that the requirement in proposed section 89N to follow the full disputes process becomes entirely ineffective if section 114 of the TAA can validate an assessment notwithstanding the fact that the Commissioner may have failed to comply with section 89N. Paragraph (a) in section 114 should be amended or deleted to prevent this. Comment Section 114 provides that the validity of an assessment shall not be affected if any of the Revenue Acts have not been complied with. Section 114 of the TAA is intended to prevent arguments that the Commissioner was not entitled to make an assessment at all. The section, in essence, directs the taxpayer to convince the Commissioner (in a dispute) or the court (in a challenge) that the amount of the assessment is incorrect and by how much, rather than argue the validity of the assessment on procedural grounds. In considering section 114 the courts have noted that an assessment takes its character from the nature and quality of the decision made and not from matters of process or administration. In CIR v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd \[1994\] 2 NZLR 681, Richardson J held that in practice there were only two situations where the validity of the assessment itself could be attacked: • when, in law, no assessment was actually made – for example, a tentative or provisional assessment; or • the Commissioner did not exercise proper judgment in arriving at the decision to assess. (There must be a genuine attempt to ascertain the taxable income of a taxpayer even if carried out cursorily or perfunctorily.) In Dandelion Investments Ltd v CIR \[1997\] 2 NZLR 96 Salmon J concluded that there was no need to consider validity in any depth; rather, the taxpayer should have used the hearing to convince the court the assessment was incorrect and to what extent. In addition, even in the unlikely event that Inland Revenue were to circumvent the disputes process through reliance on section 114, the courts have the power to cure any procedural defects relating to the assessment. 80 A proposed amendment to section 114 does not alter its scope. The amendment confirms that an assessment made at the direction of an authorised officer, for example at the direction of an adjudicator, and assessments made following current policy or practice directed by the Commissioner is valid. The New Zealand Law Society has no concerns with this proposal. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Minor amendment to the challenge procedures – section 138B(3)(b) Clause 102 Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society) The legislation needs to specify what document is the “written disputable decision” for the purposes of section 138B(3). Comment Section 138B(3) provides taxpayers with the ability to challenge an assessment when the Commissioner has rejected (by issuing a notice of response) a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer and the Commissioner does not subsequently issue an amended assessment. Therefore the section has a very limited application. Some confusion has arisen for taxpayers in respect of the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner provided for in section 138B(3)(b). Taxpayers can challenge an assessment if they file proceedings within that response period. This written disputable decision was not intended to be restricted to the notice of response referred to in section 138B(3)(a). Therefore, the amendment clarifies this point by providing that the reference to “within the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner” is not restricted to the notice of response issued by the Commissioner. This means that the full disputes process will more clearly be provided for in the case of a taxpayer-initiated dispute. Officials consider that it is not appropriate to further define what the written notice is. This is because the ability to challenge may arise at any stage of the disputes process – for example, where the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree to proceed to court and the Commissioner does not issue an amended assessment. This could occur in a taxpayer-initiated dispute. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 Issue: Test cases Clause 84 Submission (27 – KPMG) It should be clarified that the taxpayer does not have to agree to be bound by the outcome of the test case, and can have the disputes procedures recommenced. If a taxpayer agrees to suspend the disputes procedures, all time periods necessary for the completion of the dispute should be reinstated. The outcome of the test case should be notified to all taxpayers who suspended their dispute under the test case procedures. Comment New section 89O allows for the suspension of a dispute as the result of the outcome of a test case. If the section does apply, the taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest of the date of the court’s decision, the date on which the test case is otherwise resolved, or the date on which the dispute is otherwise resolved. In agreeing to suspend the dispute, the taxpayer agrees to be assessed (or not as the case may be) on the basis of the test case. In such a case, any time bars affecting the dispute are stayed. Enabling the taxpayer and the Commissioner to agree to designate a case as a test case earlier in the disputes process will reduce administrative and compliance costs that might otherwise arise if the case involves, say, a taxpayer who is one of a number involved in a single scheme or in a series of similar transactions. The new test case process for disputes does not affect the taxpayer’s ability to challenge the assessment through the court process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 Issue: Self-assessment of GST and section 108A of the TAA Clause 96 Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society, 27 – KPMG) Both the existing and proposed exceptions to the GST time bar, read literally, in most cases remove any effect of the time bar. That is because the time bar will not apply if a taxpayer “fails to disclose...all material facts that are necessary for determining the amount of GST payable for a GST return period”. Therefore the materiality element should be removed. Comment The submission refers to an existing element in the wording of section 108A, which is not being amended in this bill. The amendment contained in the bill to section 108A of the TAA is a consequential amendment to reflect the move to self-assessment of GST. Therefore the requested amendment is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 83 Other policy issues 84 85 DEDUCTIBILITY FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENT AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT CONSENT APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT GRANTED OR ARE WITHDRAWN Issue: Resource management consents that are not fixed life intangible property Clause 11 Submission (6 – Holcim, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The changes should be extended to clarify that a deduction is available for costs associated with Resource Management Act consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn, where a depreciation deduction would otherwise have been available if the consent had been issued. The deduction should not be limited to just consent applications that would have been treated as fixed life intangible property if granted. Comment The bill proposes amendments to allow costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn to be made deductible. In relation to resource management consents, the changes, as currently drafted, are limited to costs associated with consent applications that would have constituted fixed life intangible property (if granted). Fixed life intangible property is any depreciable intangible property that must be depreciated over its legal life. This includes certain resource management consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. It has been submitted that the proposed changes should also recognise that some consents issued under the Resource Management Act are not fixed life intangible property. Such consents may be “depreciable intangible property” (but not fixed life intangible property) or may generally form part of the cost of other depreciable property (such as the cost of a building). The proposed changes should therefore be expanded to include expenditure in relation to consent applications that do not constitute fixed life intangible property, but would have been depreciable had an application been granted. Officials agree with this recommendation and consider that the policy intent of the change is to allow a deduction for costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn, to the extent these costs would have been depreciable had a patent or consent been granted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 86 Issue: Application date of the proposed changes Clauses 10 and 11 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed changes allowing costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn to be made deductible should apply to applications that are not granted or are withdrawn on or after the earlier of 1 April 2004 or the commencement of the person’s 2004-05 income year. Comment It has been submitted that the current application date for the proposed change – patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn in the 2004-05 or a subsequent income year – may disadvantage late balance date taxpayers. They are taxpayers who have accounting years ending with a balance date that falls between 1 April and the following 30 September. They may still be in the 2003-04 income year for tax purposes (for example, an income year beginning 1 October 2003 and ending on 30 September 2004). The current application date should not disadvantage any taxpayers, as it is designed to ensure that the change will become effective from the 2004-05 income year, regardless of balance date. We therefore do not consider that the application date for this proposal should be changed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax treatment of patents and resource management consents that are granted Submission (10 – Business New Zealand) The appropriate tax treatment of patents and resource management consents that are granted should be reconsidered. 87 Comment While the submission supports allowing costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are not granted or are withdrawn to be made deductible, it has been suggested that consideration should be given to moving away from capitalisation of patent and resource consent costs that are granted. In the case of patents, the submission comments that, even when granted, many patents will not eventuate into earning opportunities but are required to be depreciated over their legal life. The submission considers this to be a barrier to research and development. The tax treatment of patents reflects the fact that a patent, once granted, allows the patent holder monopoly rights over a particular mode of manufacture and the right to exclude others from using a patented process. It is therefore an asset to the holder and one which will last for a specified fixed term (a maximum of twenty years). Consequently, the costs associated with patents are required to be capitalised until the patent is granted and can then be depreciated for tax purposes. The submission effectively raises the issue of the economic life of a patent – where the expected income-earning capacity from a patent does not eventuate or where the patent (or more specifically the patented invention) becomes obsolete before the cessation of the patent’s legal life. Technically, in these scenarios the economic life of the patent would be less than its legal life. However, the difficulty that arises is determining the actual economic life of patents (and those of the underlying inventions). Depending on the invention being patented, economic life could vary significantly (for example, pharmaceutical versus other patents). Also, it is difficult to verify when a patent stops being used (or if it is ever used) in a taxpayer’s income- earning process. For example, some patents may simply be held to stop competitors from developing a patented product or using a patented process. Owing to these verification issues, the tax system uses the maximum legal life of a patent as a proxy for economic life. (Officials have recently released an issues paper reviewing the tax depreciation rules, which includes a discussion of the issues around the economic lives of patents.) The tax rules do, however, allow the cost of patents that are not renewed to be deductible. A patent must be renewed after the 4th, 7th, 10th and 13th years for legal protection to be ongoing. If a taxpayer does not renew a patent at any of these renewal dates, the tax rules allow the remaining tax-book value of a patent to be written off. Recommendation That the submission be noted. The concerns raised in the submission are being considered in the current review of the tax depreciation rules. 88 Issue: Deductibility for all costs that do not lead to a depreciable asset Clauses 10 and 11 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Relief should be extended to all applications that do not lead to a depreciable asset. Comment The submission comments that the proposed changes ignore a number of categories of expenditure that do not lead to the recognition of an asset (and hence may not be deductible), such as abandoned projects, failed consents, feasibility studies and aftercare expenditure. The scope of the proposed changes is to allow the deductibility of costs associated with patent and resource management consent applications that are withdrawn or are not granted, not the total cost of projects that are abandoned. Extending the proposed changes to include costs of feasibility studies and aftercare expenditure is also not within the scope of the proposed changes. Issues around deductibility of costs of feasibility studies for waste management and aftercare expenditure (such as site- restoration) are being considered separately as part of a project on expenditure incurred in preventing, combating and rectifying pollution. These issues are also canvassed in the officials’ issues paper reviewing the tax depreciation rules. The issue of feasibility expenditure, more generally, is the subject of an Inland Revenue draft interpretation statement recently released for public comment. We consider that these are more appropriate vehicles for dealing with these issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Carry-back of losses Clauses 10 and 11 Submission (16 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A provision should be made for costs that would become deductible under the proposed changes to be carried back to previous accounting periods. 89 Comment The submission comments that where a failed resource management consent application leads to a cessation of business, the resulting deduction may create a tax loss. The submission suggests that a taxpayer in such a situation should have the option of offsetting the loss against trading profits in a prior income year. The New Zealand tax rules do not allow carry-back of tax losses. Losses must be carried forward and offset against income in future years. Allowing carry-back of tax losses in the case where a consent application fails would require consideration of this option in respect of other expenditure incurred in the year of or after the cessation of business. This would have significant implications for the certainty of government revenue flows (as revenue collected in the past would be subject to taxpayer claim in future years) and would also require Inland Revenue to reopen assessments for previous income years for an uncertain number of taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 HORTICULTURAL PLANTS Issue: General support for changes Clauses 5, 12, 13, 14, 65, 68 and 90 Submissions (3 – National Council of Women of New Zealand, 10 – Business New Zealand, 17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) All submissions welcomed the proposed changes. The National Council of Women say that the “amortisation changes ... should be welcomed ... \[and\] are seen as offering relief from dependency on bank overdraft facilities.” Business New Zealand “supports the intent of the new rules to provide greater certainty for the treatment of replacement plants.” The Fruitgrowers Federation supports the introduction of the proposed changes because they reduce the uncertainties with regard to the tax treatment of replacement horticultural plants and will reduce the compliance costs for the industry. The rules will provide an objective measure rather than having to relying on subjective tests. The proposed rules closer reflect the commercial realities of sometimes replacing damaged trees by using different varieties. ICANZ support the introduction of proposed changes provided they are an optional extension because in the Institute’s view, in some instances, greater deductibility remains under general principles. Comment The amendments are in response to concerns raised by the Fruitgrowers Federation and trade off the flexibility of general principles to provide certainty. In addition to the Fruitgrowers Federation, officials have consulted New Zealand Winegrowers (Wine NZ), the New Zealand Berryfruit Growers Federation and Olives NZ. Recommendation That the general support for the amendments be noted. 91 Issue: Higher yearly deductions for replacement plants Clause 13 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The Fruitgrowers Federation submits that the annual allowable replacement planting for which a complete deduction is allowed should be 15% of an orchard in one year in any three-year period. ICANZ accepts that a large proportion of a total block of trees or vines may be capital. However, they believe that more than say 7.5% of a block of tree or vines could be replaced in the ground with the same variety, with the expenditure deductible under normal principles. Comment The proposed amendments are intended to allow replacement plantings that are necessary to repair and maintain a larger planting to be made and be treated as a deductible expense, regardless of whether the same type or variety of plant is used as a replacement. The replacement deduction rules will generally apply to a whole orchard, so that damaged trees or vines can be replaced anywhere. The thresholds have been designed in consultation with the Fruitgrowers Federation, on an agreed basis that an orchard could require up to 5% replacement in a year to repair damaged, diseased or dead trees to maintain a productive enterprise. Moreover, to provide extra flexibility, 50% more – 7.5% – will be allowed to be fully deductible in any one year, with no more than 15% in a three-year period being fully deducted. This extra flexibility addresses concerns raised earlier by the Fruitgrowers Federation regarding delays that growers experience in receiving nursery stock – though this is not strictly a tax policy matter. Increasing the annual deduction threshold could disadvantage new orchardists over existing orchardists. The threshold is set so that replacement planting programmes do not, to a large extent, result in fully productive orchards being renewed without recognising the capital value of large-scale replanting activities. Without this being recognised, existing orchards that are replanted with a new type or variety of plant would have an advantage over new orchards that put in the same plants for the first time. These amendments will not restrict replacement planting activities but will provide certainty on the extent to which replacement planting will be treated as repairs and maintenance. Replacement planting in excess of the thresholds provided will be deducted over time under the amortisation rules proposed in the amendments. This excess will be accounted for as part of the capital value of the orchard. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 92 Issue: Factors in determining a plant’s useful life Clauses 65 and 90 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It is more appropriate to look at the actual useful life of a tree, rather than its natural life when determining tax amortisation rates. Economic factors should be expressly provided for in either the definition of “estimated useful life” (clause 65) or in the list of factors the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can take into account in determining the estimated useful life of a plant (clause 90). Comment The amendments provide that estimated useful life is: “in respect of a listed horticultural plant, the period of time over which the listed horticultural plant might reasonably be expected to be useful to a person in deriving income or in carrying on a business in New Zealand, having regard to such factors as natural and incidental damage, decay, disease, or exhaustion, with the expectation based on an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance.” The definition focuses on the period within which a plant is useful for earning business income. For most plants it would be reasonable to expect that this period would be less than their natural life. There appears to be doubt as to whether the other factors listed in the definition are additional matters to be taken into account or specify the kinds of factors to be taken into account. The overall clarity and operation of this provision could be improved by removing the (italicised) list of factors which are also addressed by the replacement planting rule. This change would address the concerns raised in submissions to the extent that economic factors affect the time over which plants can reasonably be expected to be useful to a person in producing income. However, some matters affecting the economic viability of some plants cannot be predicted and taken into account – for example, changes in world production or consumer markets. Directly referring to other economic factors in broad terms in the statute would introduce too much uncertainty about what might reasonably be expected to affect the useful life of a plant. More specific factors such as the lifecycle of a product in a market cannot be estimated with sufficient certainty or reliability to provide a consistent result over time in the Commissioner’s determinations of amortisation rates. 93 Officials note that because the amortisation of planting expenditure uses only a diminishing value method, most of that expenditure will be deducted in the first years of amortisation. This ameliorates the effect of unpredictable changes in the market in later years. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, by clarifying that the Commissioner is not limited to considering the specific factors currently listed in the definition of “estimated useful life”. Issue: Amortisation rates Clause 13 Submission (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation) The current amortisation rate should be a minimum rate in the future. Comment The amortisation rate should reflect the estimated useful life of a plant. The current single rate that applies to vines and trees provides an arbitrary result to the extent that the useful lives of different plants differ. The current rate remains as a default rate for plants not listed as plants that the new rules will apply to. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Leasing horticultural businesses Clause 13 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The rules should apply to both landowners and growers if the landowner is not also the grower. 94 Comment Submissions highlight a change in the horticulture industry over time whereby it is becoming increasingly common for the ownership and operation of orchards to be separated. Changing the proposed amendments, as submitted, so that they apply to both parties would risk one item of expenditure being deducted by both a landowner and an orchard operator (when they are different people). Officials consider that some change to the proposed amendments is required, to ensure that planting expenditure does not fall into a black hole where no-one can deduct it. The drafting of proposed section DO 4C should be amended to refer to “developed land” rather than referring to development by the taxpayer who is in the business of operating the orchard. The proposed amendments should allow the person who carries on a horticultural business to deduct planting development expenditure associated with their business, regardless of whether the development is on land they lease or own. On the termination of a lease arrangement, a landowner who then operates the orchard should be able to continue to amortise the value of any development done by a lessee – the value of which may then be reflected in any subsequent lease arrangement. Also, even if the owner does not operate the orchard, the owner should be able to pass on the ability to amortise the value of the development to a subsequent lessee. These situations are currently provided for under section DO 4 and, therefore, proposed section DO 4C should be amended accordingly. If landowners do not operate the orchards on their land, any planting activities carried out by them while the orchard is operated by another person should be recognised under the lease or other contractual arrangements they have with their orchard operators. As the planting expenditure in this kind of situation effectively provides additional capital for the orchard operation, the recognition of the landowners’ planting activities would be a commercial matter to be managed by contract. This is the position under the current rules, and it ensures that neither two deductions nor no deduction are available for an amount of planting expenditure under the amortisation rules for horticultural plants. Recommendation That proposed section DO 4C be amended to refer to “developed land” rather than development by a taxpayer. 95 Issue: Whether horticultural replacement planting rules should apply more broadly Clauses 13 and 65 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The wording in sections DO 4C(1) and DO 4D(1) should be the same. Comment The difference in the wording used in sections DO 4C(1) and DO 4D(1) is deliberate as the replacement planting rules in DO 4D(1) should apply only to horticultural activities. The replacement planting rules should not apply to non-horticultural farming and agricultural businesses. Officials accept that minor changes to the drafting of the opening words could improve consistency of expression without affecting the substantive difference in the provisions. This is being considered by drafters. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Defining horticultural plants Clause 65 Submissions (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The exclusion for timber trees should be removed. Instead of a definition of non-listed horticultural plants it would be simpler for the Act to refer to “a horticultural plant, tree, vine, bush, cane or similar plant that is not a listed horticultural plant”. Comment Both suggestions would have the effect of including timber trees within the scope of the rules for horticulture. The tax treatment of timber trees is covered by a separate set of rules for forestry that provide a different treatment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 96 Issue: Specify method of election Clause 13 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The rules should state how to make the election referred to in section DO 4D(2)(c). This is done elsewhere in the Act – for example, section EH 25(4) Comment It is currently implicit that an election would be made by a person in making their assessment (and filing a return). However, officials agree that it can be explicitly stated that an election is given effect by taking a tax position in filing a return. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Extra immediate deduction for storm damage Clause 13 Submission (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation) Storm damage should be able to be immediately deductible, in addition to the allowance guaranteed under the proposed amendments. Comment Damage from a range of sources, including storm and weather damage, and disease, have been factored into the thresholds provided for immediate deduction. Large-scale replacements, whether they are due to storm damage or are carried out for other reasons, give rise to deductions for the book-value of plants written off. Replacement plants will be immediately deductible up to the thresholds provided in the proposed amendments and thereafter will be capitalised and deducted under the amortisation rules. This ensures that the productive capital of an orchard is recognised for tax purposes. 97 The reason for these amendments is to provide certainty and to save the industry compliance costs, including those that would be incurred in arguing a complex set of legal propositions with Inland Revenue or through the Courts. The amendments are intended as an alternative to the industry having to argue under general principles. They are also intended to avoid arguments about, for example, what constitutes a storm and, therefore, storm damage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Terminology – “vines and trees” and “horticultural plant” Clause 65 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Changing the terminology from “vines and trees” to “horticultural plant” could narrow the types of plants that could be included by using the word “horticultural”. There is a risk that blueberry bushes fall outside the current rules. Comment The definition of “listed horticultural plant” for the new rules, in addition to trees and vines, specifically includes things over which there could be doubt, such as bushes and canes. In addition, greater specificity would be provided by the Commissioner when listing plants under the rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 98 Issue: Definitions of “plot” and “planting” Clause 13 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The definition of “planting” relates only to new listed horticultural plants which are planted in an income year. The definitions of “plot” and “planting” should encompass all land at the end of a year on which listed horticultural plants are planted as there is a requirement for separate accounting. Comment In section DO 4B “planting” refers to plants, and “plot” refers to the land on which plants are planted. “Replaced area fraction” refers to the proportion of the plot on which plants are replaced. There is a requirement to account separately for replacement plants on newly acquired land for as long as the three-year, 15% replacement planting threshold would be affected. Otherwise plantings on all land are encompassed by the rules on the same terms. If situations involving the acquisition of land were not provided for, the rule for the three-year threshold would be too uncertain, with the risk that growers would not be able to deduct the costs of replacement plantings on a newly acquired block because they had reached the replacement planting threshold in relation to an existing part of their business. Officials note that submissions appear not to have noted the effect of proposed section DO 4B(3), which permits amalgamations of plantings under certain circumstances. The drafting of proposed section DO 4B could contain cross-references to help readers. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 99 Issue: Other drafting concerns Clause 13 Submissions (17 – Fruitgrowers Federation, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • Section DO 4C(6) could be more clearly expressed. • The use of the words “that” and “is” in the words before the formulae in DO 4C and DO 4D should be consistent. • Item f in DO 4D(4)(b) should refer to “income years” rather than “income year”. • The rules should state that listed horticultural plants can be replaced by listed horticultural plants of any variety. Comment A number of drafting matters have been raised throughout submissions for clarification or suggested changes of wording. These as with other drafting matters will be considered by drafters. Officials consider changes could be made to accommodate the first three points. However, we note that some concerns raised are already addressed in the legislation but using slightly different words that appear to achieve the same effect. For example, with regard to the fourth point, “replacement plant” means “a listed horticultural plant that replaces a listed horticultural plant, whether or not it is of the same type of listed horticultural plant”. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 100 Issue: Exclusion for wine growers Clause 65 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The treatment for wine growers should remain under the current rules rather than being included in the new rules. Comment In consultation prior to this bill being introduced, the wine-growing industry asked to be included within the scope of the new rules on the basis that they would further consider their position and, if needed, would raise the matter of exclusion in a submission to this Committee. On 8 July 2004 officials contacted the Grape Growers Council (which represents growers of grapes for wine production and is part of Wine NZ) and learned that, despite not having made a submission on the proposed change, the industry wished to remain under the current rules. Officials consider that vines used to grow grapes for wine production should be included in the list of excluded plants in the definition of “listed horticultural plant”. These vines will consequently fall into the definition of a “non-listed horticultural plant”, for which the current treatment continues under the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 SALE AND LEASEBACK OF INTANGIBLES Issue: Rely on anti-avoidance rules instead of proceeding with reform Clauses 19 and 65 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed amendment should be reconsidered after Inland Revenue has determined whether the anti-avoidance provisions deal with the issue. In the commentary to the bill it is stated that the anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 may apply to the type of transaction that the amendment is intended to capture. If the anti-avoidance rules do apply there is no requirement for the amendment, and therefore it is unnecessary. Comment The type of transactions that the amendments are directed against raise significant tax base protection concerns. They involve the sale and leaseback of intangibles under which tax deductions are claimed for what are, in substance, repayments of principal under a loan. The proposed amendments are designed to protect the tax base by ensuring that such deductions cannot be taken. The submission argues that the amendments are unnecessary because the type of transaction causing concern should be able to be countered under the general anti- avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act 1994: sections BG 1 and GB 1. Although it is possible that Inland Revenue could apply the general anti-avoidance rules in the income tax legislation against this type of transaction, this may involve litigation where the outcome is not certain. Also, any possible litigation involving the application of the general anti-avoidance rules can take a considerable period of time to complete. Therefore officials do not consider that it is sufficiently certain or timely to rely on the general anti-avoidance provisions to counter the type of schemes causing concern, instead of proceeding with the proposed amendments. The best way of protecting the tax base with sufficient certainty and in a timely manner against the type of transaction causing concern in this case is to proceed with the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 Issue: Review of finance lease rules instead of proceeding with proposed amendments Clauses 19 and 65 Submission (18 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) Concerns about any deliberate or inadvertent changes to the finance lease rules is reinforced by the existing difficulties with these rules. These difficulties arise from inadvertent consequences and the different factual permutations that exist. The submission considers that piece-meal changes to the finance lease rules should not be made but, rather, a review should be undertaken of the entire finance lease provisions. Comment The proposed amendments are being made to ensure that taxpayers entering into transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles such as trademarks do not get deductions for what are, in substance, repayments of loan principal. The proposed amendments are designed to protect the tax base. In particular, it is proposed to amend the tax rules for finance leases, which prevent deductions being taken for the principal amount of a deemed loan, to ensure that the transactions involving the sale and leaseback of intangibles that cause concern are caught by these rules. The tax base protection concerns which will be addressed by the proposed amendments are significant and need to be addressed now and cannot wait until any wider tax review of the finance lease tax rules. Any other remedial amendments to the finance lease rules to improve the operation of these rules can be dealt with under the general tax policy work programme. It is not necessary or desirable to defer the proposed amendments until any remedial amendments to the finance lease rules are also prepared. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 103 Issue: Concern over scope of proposed amendments Clauses 19 and 65 Submissions (18 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 10W – Business New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21 – New Zealand Law Society)) A number of submissions expressed concern over the scope of the proposed amendments and, in particular, on any adverse and unintended implications for leases of tangible assets. The Finance and Expenditure Committee should carefully consider the implications the bill’s provisions on the sale and leaseback of intangible property might have on leases of other assets. (Business New Zealand) The proposed amendments may also cause some leases to inadvertently fall into the definition of “finance lease” when previously they did not. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) The proposed changes go further than is necessary to achieve the stated tax objective and if the proposed legislation were to proceed without further changes, a degree of uncertainty would be introduced with respect to non-targeted commercial leasing arrangements. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed changes to the law to deal with the government’s concern about the sale and licence back of intangible property will adversely affect a wide range of genuine leasing and licencing transactions. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment The proposed amendments are designed to protect the tax base against transactions that could otherwise raise significant tax base protection concerns by allowing taxpayers to obtain deductions for what are, in substance, repayments of loan principal. Such an outcome is contrary to the policy intent underlying the tax treatment of debt transactions. It is not desirable for the proposed amendments to affect normal commercial leasing transactions that do not raise tax base maintenance concerns. Officials consider that concerns raised by submissions about the scope of the proposed amendments can be adequately addressed by either amending the proposals or issuing guidance on Inland Revenue’s interpretation of these amendments in the Tax Information Bulletin item published following the enactment of the amendments. These changes and departmental interpretations are discussed under the specific issues set out below in this report. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 104 Issue: Replacing substantive rights-based test with more targeted test Clause 65 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) The current wording for proposed new paragraph (d) of the finance lease definition will lead to uncertainty (and therefore increased compliance costs) over the application of the finance lease rules to both tangible and intangible property leases. The uncertainty is brought about by the fact that the phrase “substantive rights or obligations” is not defined and does not have a clearly discernible ordinary meaning in the context of leasing transactions. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) New paragraph (d) of the finance lease definition should be redrafted so that it applies only to the mischief the amendment is seeking to correct. A replacement form of wording focusing on the ability of the lessee or an associate, since a period of previous ownership, to reacquire or control the disposition of the lease asset, is suggested. As currently drafted, it is not clear what paragraph (d) achieves. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The wording in new paragraph (d) should be more targeted at the sale and leaseback transactions that are causing concern. The meaning of the words “no substantive rights or obligations in relation to the lease asset other than rights or obligations that relate to the enforcement of the lease” in proposed new paragraph (d) is not clear and the words themselves are very broad. Replacement wording for paragraph (d), focusing on a feature of the arrangements causing concern, involving an associate of the lessee having an option to acquire the lease asset who is not entitled to all of the lease payments accruing after the acquisition of the lease asset, is suggested. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The bill proposes to expand the definition of “finance lease” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (by adding a new paragraph (d) in the definition) to include a sale and leaseback arrangement under which the lessor has no substantive rights and obligations of ownership, other than those relating to enforcement of the lease agreement. An example of this would be where the lessee or an associate had always retained the ability, since the period of previous ownership, to reacquire or control the disposition of the lease asset. Although officials consider that the proposed amendment would be effective in relation to the type of transactions causing concern, we agree that the current wording of the proposed amendment may catch inadvertently other leasing transactions which do not have tax base protection concerns. This could have the consequence that some ordinary operating leases may be treated inappropriately as finance leases. We therefore agree with submissions that the substantive rights-based test in new paragraph (d) of the definition of “finance lease” should be replaced with a more targeted test. 105 Officials prefer the approach suggested by the New Zealand Law Society, which focuses on a feature of the transactions causing concern, that the sale of the lease asset back to the associate of the lessee does not involve the associate receiving all the rentals accruing from the date of sale; instead, lease payments continue to flow to the lessor (the financier). This is an unusual feature as, normally, following the sale of a lease asset, the new owner is entitled to the lease payments following the sale. It is this feature of the transactions that indicates their financing nature and, accordingly, it is appropriate to treat arrangements with this feature as finance leases. Specifically, paragraph (d) should include in the finance lease definition arrangements that involve an associate of the lessee having an option to acquire the lease asset (or the lessor having an option to require an associate of the lessee to acquire the lease asset) if under the terms of the option the associate is not entitled to all of the lease payments (if any) accruing after the acquisition of the lease asset under the option. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that the approach suggested by the New Zealand Law Society for new paragraph (d) of the definition of “finance lease” be adopted. Issue: Arrangement-based test Clause 65 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes to the finance lease definition would subject a lease “that involves or is part of an arrangement that involves” the various events specified in the finance lease definition limbs to the finance lease rules. The new test will necessarily involve a determination of the “arrangement” in respect of which the lease forms part of, and an assessment of whether the tests set out in the finance lease definition are met in relation to that arrangement rather than just the lease itself. In our view, the inherent difficulty in determining the composition of an “arrangement” for the purposes of the finance lease rules would lead to increased uncertainty for taxpayers. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The current definition of a finance lease is clear, by use of the words “under which” in the opening paragraph, that for tax purposes only the lease document itself needs to be considered by the taxpayers that are a party to that lease agreement in determining whether the lease is a finance lease. Under the current definition it can be established at the time of entering into the lease whether the lease will be a finance lease by reviewing the lease contract. This definition, which has had application since 20 May 1999, uses the words “under which” in order to provide certainty that was lacking in the pre-20 May 1999 specified lease definition. (New Zealand Law Society and Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) 106 The opening paragraph of the finance lease definition should not be amended as proposed. The finance lease definition should retain the words “under which”, as these words provide the certainty that is a key feature of the current finance lease definition which was enacted in 1999. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The submission understands that it is not the intention of the government to broaden the scope of the finance lease definition so that events that occur subsequently to entering into the lease can retrospectively cause it to be a finance lease from the time the lease was entered into. However, the use of the word “arrangement” in the proposed amendment could have such an effect. (New Zealand Law Society) When this amendment is enacted, an explanatory Tax Information Bulletin item should be issued, in which it is confirmed that in interpreting the term “arrangement” in the amended finance lease definition only any arrangement existing at the time the lease is entered into should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not a lease is a finance lease. It should be made clear that subsequent events are not considered part of an “arrangement” for the purposes of the application of the “finance lease” definition. (New Zealand Law Society and alternative Minter Ellison Rudd Watts submission) Comment The bill proposes to amend the definition of “finance lease” to provide that a lease “that involves or is part of an arrangement that involves” a situation specified in one of the limbs in the definition is a finance lease. Officials confirm that it is not intended to broaden the definition so that events that occur subsequently and independently to entering into the lease (other than an effective extension of the lease term, which is specifically dealt with) can retrospectively cause it to be a finance lease from the date the lease was entered into. The amendment is intended to clarify that the finance lease rules can apply if a feature referred to in the finance lease definition limbs, such as a transfer of ownership to the lessee or an associate or an option granted to a lessee or an associate, is contemporaneously part of the leasing arrangement when the lease is entered into but is not specified in the lease agreement itself. (Instead, such a feature is separately documented.) The interpretation guidance given in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 11 No. 6 (July 1999) remains applicable. In particular, when taxpayers enter into a lease they should generally be able to ascertain whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Certainty therefore remains one of the aims of the finance lease definition. Officials would therefore support the New Zealand Law Society and alternative Minter Ellison Rudd Watts submissions that, following the enactment of the amendment, an explanatory Tax Information Bulletin should be published confirming that in interpreting the term “arrangement” in the amended finance lease definition only any arrangement existing at the time the lease is entered into should be taken into account in determining whether a lease is a finance lease. Subsequent and independent events will not be considered to be part of the arrangement. 107 In relation to the example in the New Zealand Law Society submission, officials consider that the subsequent and independent agreement under which the lessee acquires the lease asset at the end of the lease term would not be considered part of the leasing arrangement. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by agreeing to the publication of an explanatory Tax Information Bulletin item after the amendment is enacted which confirms that in interpreting the term “arrangement” in the amended finance lease definition only any arrangement existing at the time the lease is entered into should be taken into account in determining whether or not a lease is a finance lease. Issue: Limiting amendments to leases of intangible property Clauses 19 and 65 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The background material to this amendment clearly envisage the proposed amendments to be a revenue base protection measure in the context of sale and licence or leaseback transactions involving intangible property which is not depreciable intangible property. However, the proposed legislative amendments have not been specifically restricted to intangible property transactions and, as drafted, are likely to result in the application of the finance lease rules to many non-targeted commercial sale and leaseback transactions involving depreciable intangible property. Our primary submission therefore is that the legislation should be limited to intangible property leases in order to preserve the policy intent underlying the changes. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) That, consistent with the intent to capture sale and leaseback transactions involving intangible property, paragraph (d) be redrafted to restrict its scope to leases of intangible property only. Although the transaction, giving rise to the concern, will certainly be captured by the new paragraph, we are not convinced there is any mischief in the sale and leaseback of tangible items that needs to be caught under the finance lease rules. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Officials consider it is difficult to justify limiting particular aspects of the finance lease definition (as proposed to be amended) to specific types of property. This is currently not done in the definition. 108 Although the type of transactions causing concern currently are certain sale and leasebacks of intangible property, and one of the specific amendments clarifies that the finance lease rules may apply to the granting of a licence to use intangible property, other amendments address general weaknesses in the definition of “finance lease” which are not restricted to a specific type of property. For example, an amendment will widen the application of paragraph (a) of the definition to include a lease which involves the transfer of ownership of the lease asset to the lessee or an associate during or at the end of the lease term rather than only at the end of the lease term, as the current definition provides. It is difficult to justify limiting this amendment to leases of intangible property only. Officials consider that the replacement paragraph (d) recommended in this report should address many of the concerns raised by submissions. There would seem to be no reason for limiting the new paragraph (d) in the definition, which focuses on whether the associate of the lessee is entitled to the lease payments after it purchases the lease asset, to leases of specific types of property only. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Non-exclusive licences to use intangible property Clause 65 Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 21 – New Zealand Law Society) A licence to use intangible property should only be a finance lease where the licensee obtains an exclusive right to use the licensed property. The deeming of all licences to use intangible property to be leases for tax purposes will have a very wide and unintended application. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Paragraph (c) of the finance lease definition, which refers to leases with a lease term of more than 75 percent of the lease asset’s estimated useful life, should not apply to licences to use intangible property which the bill proposes to include in the definition of “lease” for the purposes of the finance lease definition. This inclusion of licences to use intangible property could deem ordinary commercial licences to be finance leases for tax purposes under paragraph (c) of the finance lease definition. This must be unintended. If the decision is made that paragraph (c) of the finance lease definition should apply to licences of intangible property, then this should only be the case where the licence gives the licensee exclusive rights to use the licensed property. (New Zealand Law Society) In particular, the submissions give examples of the licencing of the right to use sales- related software to shops by a software owner as types of transaction that could be treated inadvertently as finance leases under the amendments. 109 Comment An amendment will clarify that the finance lease rules can apply to the grant of a licence to use intangible property by the owner of the property. This proposed amendment is in line with the definition of “lease” recommended in 1992 by the Valabh Committee, which proposed the revised finance lease rules that came into effect in 1999. (The Committee recommended that “a definition of lease would refer to any arrangement entered into involving the grant of the use or the right to use any lease asset”.) Officials consider that restricting this amendment to exclusive licences to use intangible property could leave the amendments vulnerable to circumvention. This is because it is a feature of intangible property that it can be easily subdivided in terms of geography, time and in other ways. Therefore it would be quite easy to convert what is, in substance, an exclusive licence into what is formally a non-exclusive licence, which would then fall outside the ambit of the amendments if they were restricted to exclusive licences, as proposed by the submissions. Importantly, officials do not agree that commonplace computer software transactions such as those referred to in the submissions would be caught by the proposed amendment to include licences to use intangible property. This view is based on the principles contained in the Inland Revenue Department interpretation guideline “Non- resident software suppliers’ payments derived from New Zealand – income tax treatment”, which was published in November 2003. The principles set out in that guideline on the classification and income tax treatment of various software transactions involving non-resident suppliers of software are also applicable to wholly domestic situations. These guidelines state that computer software transactions can generally be classified into two types: those relating to the copyright rights in the computer program and those relating to copies of the computer program that is protected by copyright. Functionally, the two types of transaction relate to the use of copyright and the use of a copy of the program respectively. Commonplace software transactions generally involve copies of computer programs (which may be protected by copyright), not copyright rights in the computer program. The amendment to include licences to use intangible property could apply only to transactions involving the supply of copyright rights (for example, the licence of a copyright right in a computer program). The type of computer software transactions that the submissions are concerned about involve the supply of a copy of a computer program (by way of sale or lease) that is used in the business of the recipient and do not involve the supply of intangible property such as copyright rights. The interpretation guideline draws a distinction between acquiring a computer program for personal or business use (as occurs in the examples in the submissions) and acquiring the program for commercial exploitation through the use of one or more of the copyright rights. It is only where a supplier gives a customer the ability to exploit the supplier’s copyright rights in a program that the transaction will be a copyright right transaction, and therefore could come within the meaning of the words “licence to use intangible property”. Where a customer is not granted the ability to exploit the copyright rights in the program, but is merely provided with the right to use a copy of the program for personal or business use, the transaction will be a 110 copyrighted article transaction, which does not involve the use of intangible property such as copyright rights and therefore is not covered by the amendment in the bill. The Inland Revenue interpretation guideline also makes it clear that the fact that some form of end-user licence may accompany a transaction involving the supply of a copy of a computer program (by way of sale or lease) does not change the transaction to one involving the supply of copyright rights. The purpose of such licences is generally to restrict the recipient contractually from exploiting any of the rights protected by copyright. The licence is not for the use, or the right to use of, any copyright (as would be so in the case of a reproduction licence) but to prohibit use of the copyright. The licence is a vehicle to further assert the copyright owner’s rights. There is no transfer of the copyright. From a practical and business perspective, the contract between the parties is for the supply of a copy of a copyrighted article. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Technical error in paragraph (c) of the finance lease definition Clause 65 Submission (21 – New Zealand Law Society) If the decision is made that paragraph (c) should potentially apply to licences of intangible property, there is a technical error in the wording of the paragraph. The error is the reference in paragraph (c) to an asset’s estimated useful life “as that term is used in the formula applied by the Commissioner under section EG 4(3)”. The purpose of section EG 4(3) is to set the diminishing value economic rate of depreciation for an asset. However, intangible property that is “fixed life intangible property” (FLIP) must be depreciated using the straight line depreciation basis (pursuant to section EG 3(2))) and cannot be depreciated on a diminishing value basis. Therefore, section EG 4(3) can have no application to FLIP (as it refers to diminishing value depreciation) which in turn arguably means that paragraph (c) of the “finance lease” definition can never apply to FLIP or to intangible property generally. Comment Officials agree that the technical error identified by the submission should be corrected. The current wording of paragraph (c) of the definition of “finance lease” should be replaced with “the lease term is more than 75 percent of the lease asset’s estimated useful life”. The definition of “estimated useful life” in section OB 1 applies to all depreciable property, including fixed life intangible property. The definition of “fixed life intangible property” in turn refers back to the definition of “estimated useful life”. 111 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of accrual rules to “in substance” principal Clauses 19 and 65 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submission refers to the example in the commentary on the bill and assuming the policy intent is to treat the sale and leaseback transaction as a $9 million loan with $3 million interest payable, existing section FC 8A(2) and (3) treats the value of the loan to be the “lessor’s disposition value” and the “lessee’s acquisition cost” respectively. As the transaction now falls within the accruals rules, it will be necessary to determine the consideration paid/received for the acquisition/disposal of the property in order to be able to apply an appropriate spreading method and calculate the base price adjustment when appropriate. Existing section EH 48(2) requires the value of the property to be determined by applying subsection (3)(a) to (d) in alphabetical order until a paragraph applies. The submission considers that it is not clear how section EH 48(3) identifies the “in substance principal” of $9 million. Therefore, more work be undertaken to clarify how the “in substance” amounts are to be brought to tax once captured by the finance lease definition. Comment Officials consider that the amended finance lease rules would apply in the following way to the example in the commentary in the bill. Under section FC 8A the trademark is treated as being sold from the non-resident bank to B Co on the day the lease starts. The bank is treated as giving B Co a loan for the trademark, and B Co is treated as using the loan to purchase the trademark. For B Co, the amount of the loan is the “lessee’s acquisition cost” (section FC 8A(3)). This is defined in section OB 1 to mean the consideration provided to the lessee under the finance lease. “Consideration” is defined in section OB 1 as meaning an amount determined in accordance with section EH 48. Section EH 48(2) states that for an original party to a finance lease (such as B Co), if the consideration includes property or services, the value of the property or services is determined by applying subsection (3)(a) to (d) in order until a paragraph applies. The consideration provided to B Co is essentially the value of the trademarks that B Co is deemed to have purchased from the bank with the proceeds of the deemed loan under section FC 8A. 112 It is officials’ view that section EH 48(3)(a) is applicable in this situation. It provides that the value of the property (the trademarks) is the lowest price the parties would have agreed, on the date the licence agreement was entered into, if payment would have been required in full at the time the first right in the trademarks was transferred. Officials consider that the lowest price the bank would have accepted for the trademarks on the commencement of the licence is $9 million, being the difference between $20 million (the amount the bank paid A Co for its purchase of the trademarks immediately before the commencement of the licence) and the $11 million amount payable to the bank by C Co for its purchase of the trademarks under the call option. The same interpretation of section EH 48(2) is used for the purpose of calculating and spreading B Co’s interest deduction under the accrual rules (including calculating the base price adjustment). The interest component of the deemed loan is $3 million (being $9 million consideration payable to B Co less $12 million consideration payable by B Co). This amount is deductible to B Co and spread under the accrual rules. B Co is treated as owning the lease asset (the trademarks) but as trademarks are not depreciable property, there is no depreciation deduction. This treatment accords with the correct policy outcome. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 113 EARLY PAYMENT REBATE Clause 33 New small businesses are not required to pay income tax for their first year in business until their second year, when they also have to pay tax for their second year. Some businesses face financial difficulties as a result. To address this problem, the early payment rebate provides an incentive by way of a 6.7 percent rebate for self-employed taxpayers or partners in a partnership to pay tax voluntarily during their first year in business. Issue: Support for the proposal and advertising the rebate Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submissions strongly support the proposal and consider the measure to be a positive move to encourage new businesses to pay tax early so as not to face financial difficulties in year two. However, one submission considered that resources should be targeted for a major education programme to communicate the concession to the newly self-employed. There is a risk that self-employed taxpayers will not be aware of the proposal as they tend to get tax advice after the end of their first year, when it is too late to take advantage of the rebate. Comment Officials agree that an education campaign needs to be undertaken to promote the rebate and that using the standard methods of communication may not be appropriate for this group of people. Inland Revenue will undertake a number of initiatives aimed at targeting information and advertising to new small businesses or those considering starting a business. The specific initiatives are in the process of being developed. This will be in addition to information provided to agents and those newly registered for GST. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 114 Issue: Rate of the early payment rebate Submission (10 – Business New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) The rate of the early payment rebate should be increased from 6.7 percent to a more generous 10 percent. The Colmar Brunton Final Quantitative Research Report stated that the 10 percent rate was the most commonly suggested by businesses and tax agents. The rate recognises only the time-value of money and does not provide a sufficient marginal benefit to encourage early payment of tax during time when a business is likely to be cash-strapped. The rate should be more in line with the bank overdraft rate faced by small business taxpayers. Comment The Colmar Brunton survey asked for businesses’ reaction to providing a 7 percent discount for early payment of tax. Of those businesses surveyed, 64 percent rated this option 5 or greater out of 10, and 45 percent indicated a strong prospect of their taking up this option (a rating of 7 or greater out of 10). They were also asked what would be a reasonable discount rate. Forty-five percent of businesses indicated a 10 percent rate. However, the 6.7 percent rate is a risk-free, tax-free return on money deposited with Inland Revenue. This rate is more generous than the 12-month term deposit rates of the major trading banks (which would be subject to income tax) and is above the credit interest rate (4.83%) provided by Inland Revenue on overpaid income tax, which is what this payment is. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of the rebate regardless of business structure Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) The early payment rebate is available only to self-employed taxpayers or partners in a partnership. The rebate should be available to all provisional taxpayers, regardless of the business structure used by the taxpayer. Submissions acknowledged that companies could establish a new subsidiary in order to be eligible for the rebate but considered that an appropriate anti-avoidance provision could exclude group companies. 115 Comment While there is some merit to the idea that the choice of business structure should not affect entitlement to the rebate, if entitlement were extended to entities such as companies or trusts (excluding groups of companies), it could be claimed a number of times by the same person. Clearly, this would be an inappropriate policy result. For example, a person could get a rebate when he or she becomes self-employed or a partner in partnership, as well as when the business is incorporated as a company and again if the business is transferred to a trust. The same taxpayer could benefit by being a major shareholder of the company and major beneficiary of the trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Availability of the early payment rebate Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section MBC 2(1)(c), which deals with restrictions on who would be eligible to claim the rebate, should be removed. PricewaterhouseCoopers considers that the section is unclear and, rather than ceasing business for four years, the rebate should refer to ceasing to be a provisional taxpayer with no specified “stand-down period”. The Institute considers that the requirement for a four-year gap between businesses is arbitrary and lacking detail, and difficulties will be experienced in determining “what is a business” as some businesses move from being a hobby to a business. The proposal also needs to address circumstances where a taxpayer has previously been in business or been liable to pay provisional tax before they start up business. Comment Restrictions are placed on who is eligible to claim the rebate in order to ensure that it is effectively targeted at businesses that could face financial difficulties. The rebate increases awareness of the financial difficulties that a business could face in the second year and provides an incentive to pay tax in the first year to avoid these difficulties. Once a business is in the provisional tax system or has been a provisional taxpayer in recent years, officials consider that the business is aware of the need to make provision for tax. The rebate has therefore not been extended to those who are liable for provisional tax before they start up business. 116 However, taxpayers who have been out of business for some time may be less aware of the need to budget for two year’s worth of tax due in their second year in business. In this case it is appropriate to provide the rebate again to increase awareness and provide an incentive to make voluntary payments. Although the choice of a time period is arbitrary, a four-year period is considered long enough for a taxpayer to benefit from the reminder. If the rebate were available to those who cease paying provisional tax only for four years (rather than cease business), a company that ceased paying provisional tax because it was in a tax loss situation would qualify for the rebate once it became profitable again. The company would still be filing tax returns and might make voluntary tax payments in case it found itself with unexpected tax to pay. These taxpayers would not need to be reminded of their obligations. The income tax system already has to distinguish between a hobby, which is not taxable, and a business, which is taxable. There is a definition of “business” in the Income Tax Act 1994, and established case law in this area. Any difficulties in determining whether an activity is a business or a hobby exist, irrespective of the proposal, and any clarification would be outside of its scope. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of the early payment rebate Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts, 27 – KPMG) The early payment rebate should apply from 1 April 2004, not 1 April 2005, as proposed, to relieve financial strain earlier. Comment The aims of the rebate are to increase awareness of the financial difficulties that could occur in the second year in business and to receive tax payments earlier, as well as enabling the business to make payments during the year when their income is earned. The bill is not expected to be passed before September this year, leaving little time to develop advertising and publicise the rebate, for Inland Revenue to implement the changes, and for new businesses to pay tax during the year. A prospective application date would enable these to occur and provide a greater possibility of successful implementation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 117 Issue: Rebate be available for all of the first three years in business Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) KPMG submits that in some cases the rebate should be able to be claimed in all of the first three years in business, as chosen by the taxpayer. This would compensate taxpayers who pay early in year 1 in anticipation of being a provisional taxpayer in year 2 but later find out they do not have to pay provisional tax in year 2. The same situation could occur in years 2 and 3. Taxpayers in this situation should be rewarded for paying their tax early. The Institute suggests that taxpayers should be able to retrospectively elect which year the rebate should apply to. This would enable taxpayers to claim the rebate in a year when their income is positive and higher rather than a year when income is declining or the taxpayer makes a loss. Comment Allowing the rebate to be claimed in each of the first three years would effectively extend interest to these taxpayers at a more generous rate than the current credit rate of interest. It would also provide an incentive to use Inland Revenue as a bank. The measure proposed in the bill allows some flexibility around when the rebate is claimed. However, allowing the taxpayer to retrospectively elect which year to claim the rebate in has less to do with cash flow and more to do with minimising tax liability. A rebate for a three-year period would be fiscally expensive and beyond what this initiative is trying to achieve, that is encouraging taxpayers to pay tax in the first year of business and reduce the financial strain associated with paying two years’ worth of tax in the second year in business. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Index the early payment rebate rate Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) There needs to be a mechanism for the 6.7 percent discount to be increased in line with interest rate movements or inflation in order to maintain its relevance. 118 Comment The rebate is a risk-free, tax-free rate currently set above the deposit rate of the major trading banks. Officials consider that the rebate does not need to be aligned with movements in the rate of inflation. However, the submission has prompted the question of whether the rate should be able to be changed quickly if there is a significant change in interest rates. Officials therefore propose that the rate should be able to be changed by Order in Council. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the Committee agree to an amendment to enable the rate to be changed by Order in Council. Issue: Payment date for rebate Clause 33 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Currently the bill does not provide an effective payment date for the early payment rebate in order for use of money interest to be calculated. Comment If the taxpayer has applied for the early payment rebate and the Commissioner has failed to pay the rebate then interest would normally apply. However, an effective payment date is required in order for the rebate to be included in the interest calculation. Officials recommend that an effective date be included in the bill. The effective date should be the day after the end of the income year in which the rebate is claimed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 119 Issue: Applying for rebate Clause 33 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Taxpayers who have made an error in completing their tax return and elected not to receive the early payment rebate should be able to change their election. Comment Taxpayers who have made a mistake by omitting to claim the early payment rebate in their tax return should be able to apply separately to the Commissioner to claim the rebate. Officials propose that taxpayers be required to elect before the last date for furnishing the return for the income year in which the early payment rebate is claimed. This would allow mistakes to be corrected while not opening up the rebate to retrospective applications. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Not withdrawing early tax payments Clause 33 Submission (Matter raised by tax adviser) Taxpayers who deposit their money in order to qualify for the early payment rebate should not be able to withdraw their money after the end of the income year and before their return is filed. Comment As the legislation is drafted a taxpayer could make voluntary payments of income tax on or before 31 March of a year in order to obtain the early payment rebate and then withdraw the money shortly after 1 April. The intention of the rebate is to ensure that voluntary payments made during the year stay with Inland Revenue and are offset against the taxpayer’s end of year tax liability. 120 Officials propose that the provision be amended so that in order to qualify the taxpayer not only has to make voluntary payments but that those payments remain with Inland Revenue until the return is filed. Once the return is filed then the lesser of the voluntary payments or the taxpayer’s terminal tax liability has to remain with Inland Revenue until the taxpayer’s terminal tax date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Terminology change Clause 33 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The term “early payment rebate” should be replaced with “early payment discount” in order to be consistent with the structure and core provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment This measure is correctly contained in Part M of the Income Tax Act 1994 concerning tax payments. It is not correct, however, to use “rebate” terminology for this reform because rebates are dealt with in Part K of the Income Tax Act and are taken into account in calculating a person’s income tax liability. Instead, the use of the word “discount” would be more accurate. Therefore the term “early payment rebate” should be replaced with “early payment discount”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 IMPUTATION CREDITS AND TRANSFERS Issue: Elevation of issues to the Policy Advice Division Clause 36 Submission (13 – Jeff Owens & Company Ltd) While the submission supports the proposal in respect of imputation credits, the Finance and Expenditure Committee should instruct the Commissioner that where an obviously inappropriate result arises out of faulty legislation or Inland Revenue’s interpretation of legislation, an issue must be elevated to Inland Revenue Policy Advice Division as a matter of course. Comment Where tax law appears not to achieve its policy intention it is the practice for staff to escalate the matter. As a result, the Policy Advice Division should be advised if a policy problem is confirmed. There will be occasions when the policy issue is simply not recognised by Inland Revenue’s field staff, but this does not happen very often. An instruction to the Commissioner, as suggested in the submission, is therefore unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consolidated groups Clause 36 Submission (27 – KPMG) Proposed section MD 4(2)(b) should be amended to include a reference to the consolidated group’s nominated company. Comment Paragraph (b) specifies the taxpayers who are likely to have requested a transfer. It already refers to a company or a consolidated group. Reference to the nominated company of a consolidated group is unnecessary because the nominated company will always be part of the consolidated group. 122 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issue (section MD 4(3)) Clause 36 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A reference to section ME 5(1)(e) in new subsection MD 4(3) needs to be expanded to include sections ME 12(1)(d), MG 5(1)(d) and MG 15(1)(d). Comment Under new subsections MD 4(2) and (3), companies will be able to elect that a credit (a permitted credit) arises to the imputation credit account (ICA) or dividend withholding credit account (DWPA) in certain circumstances when overpaid tax was transferred before the transfer rules came into effect. The amount of the permitted credit is the amount transferred less the amount of the debit that would have arisen if the overpayment had been refunded. Section ME 5(1)(e) is one section that provides for a debit to arise if overpaid tax is refunded. Other sections are ME 12(1)(d), MG 5(1)(d) and MG 15(1)(d) and these sections should also be specified in section MD 4(3). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Drafting issue (section MD 4(2)) Clause 36 Submissions (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The criteria in section MD 4(2) should apply to Inland Revenue-initiated transfers as well as taxpayer requested transfers. 123 Comment Transfers of overpaid tax can be initiated by Inland Revenue where there is an underpayment in one year or revenue, and an overpayment is identified in relation to another year or revenue. Where such transfers satisfy the other criteria in section MD 4(2), a company should be able to elect that a permitted credit should arise in respect of that transfer also. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 124 PAYE BY INTERMEDIARIES Issue: Minimum number of employers Clause 65(17) Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The requirement for a PAYE intermediary to represent at least ten employers should be reduced to five. Comment The submission comments that the threshold of ten employers may eliminate smaller genuine intermediaries and start-up intermediaries from the scope of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules. The ten-employer minimum threshold was introduced to reduce the risk of the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules being abused by entities registering as intermediaries who do not intend to represent any employers. A minimum of ten employers was considered to provide a reasonable balance between the need to ensure intermediaries are not disadvantaged (especially during start-up) and the need to mitigate the risk of abuse. We consider that it is not unreasonable for a genuine PAYE intermediary to have at least ten clients. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “officer” Clause 54 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The term “officer” in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules should be clarified by referring to the definition of “officer” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 125 Comment The submissions comment that the proposed clarification of the term “officer” in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules is incomplete in that it does not specify that the director, secretary or statutory officer should hold these positions in respect of a “corporate body”. They suggests the inclusion of a new section in the “PAYE by intermediaries” rules (section NBB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994) defining “officer” to have the same meaning as the definition of “officer” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. There would need to be a corresponding amendment to the definition in the Tax Administration Act. The proposed changes to sections NBB 2(1)(c) and NBB 2(4)(b) clarify that “officer” means a director, secretary or statutory officer of the applicant if the applicant is not a natural person. “Person” is defined in section OB 1 as including a company and a local or public authority. Consequently, we do not consider that the further clarification suggested in the submissions is required. However, the definition of “person” also includes an unincorporated body of persons. Where an unincorporated body of persons, such as a partnership, wishes to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary we consider that the individual partners should be subject to the accreditation requirements in section NBB 2. Consequently, we consider that the proposed changes should be extended to clarify that where the applicant is an unincorporated body of persons, sections NBB 2(1)(c) and NBB 2(4)(b) apply to each member of the unincorporated body. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. However, the proposed changes should be extended to encompass members of unincorporated bodies (such as partnerships). 126 REDUCTION OF NON-DECLARATION RATE FOR NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE COMPANIES Clause 59 Issue: Support of lower non-declaration rate Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The lower non-declaration rate imposed by clause 59 is supported. Comment The submissions supports clause 59 as a positive measure to reduce the compliance burden imposed by the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax rules. The Institute of Chartered Accountants also supports the inclusion of a specific anti-avoidance measure. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date for lower non-declaration rate Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The date from which the proposed change apply should be brought forward to 1 April 2004 or the date of enactment. Comment Adjusting the non-declaration rate for payments already made would generate administrative and compliance costs for little benefit. However, there should be no difficulty in making the proposal applicable from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission to make the proposal applicable from the date of enactment be accepted. That the submission to make the proposal applicable from 1 April 2004 be declined. 127 Issue: Lowering the rate of non-resident contractors’ withholding tax Submission (27 – KPMG) The rate of non-resident contactors’ withholding tax should be lowered from 15% to 10%. Comment The submission states that when the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax was introduced the company tax rate was much higher. The withholding rate was initially set with a 50% tax rate in mind. The tax rate for companies is currently lower, and the withholding rate, therefore, should be reduced as well. The submission does not take into account that the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax applies to companies and individuals. The top personal income tax rate of 39% is higher than the company tax rate (33%). Individuals may also have lower overheads than companies, and the margin between individuals’ gross income and net income will therefore be lower. There is a higher risk of non-compliance by non-resident contractors than by resident contractors. This favours a higher withholding rate. The submission also does not relate to the proposed changes contained in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 128 RWT ON USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST Issue: Commissioner should be subject to the same rules as others Clause 62 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed amendment should not be enacted. Comment When use-of-money interest (UOMI) paid by the Commissioner was introduced, it was considered appropriate that it should be taxable and subject to the resident withholding tax (RWT) rules. The intent was to ensure that from the taxpayer’s perspective, UOMI paid by the Commissioner was treated, as much as possible, like interest received from a bank. In practice, however, it has resulted in an overly complex system with significant compliance costs for taxpayers and increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Officials consider that these costs justify adopting a different tax treatment for such payments. The proposed amendment will reduce both the compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. This proposed amendment is supported by the submissions of Business New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG. Business New Zealand and KPMG note the complexity under the current rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Provisional tax threshold Clause 62 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Any use-of-money interest received should be excluded from residual income tax. 129 Comment Removing the requirement to deduct RWT from use-of-money interest paid by the Commissioner will move 30 taxpayers into the provisional tax system. This represents $75,000 of payments brought forward from terminal tax to provisional tax. The proposed amendment is intended to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. Officials consider the overall reduction in compliance costs for taxpayers to far outweigh any added compliance costs for this very small group of taxpayers. This proposed amendment is supported by the submissions of Business New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG. PricewaterhouseCoopers note that only a limited number of taxpayers will become liable to provisional tax as a result of the proposed change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 130 INCORPORATED SOCIETIES Issue: Support for proposal Clauses 65(26), 65(29), 65(30), 67 and 142 Submission (10W – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand notes its support for the proposed amendments. Comment Incorporated societies will be allowed to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group. They will also be allowed, for a limited period, to offset income and losses against those of their commonly owned incorporated societies. These amendments ensure that incorporated societies that are treated as companies for tax purposes, can avail themselves of the same rules that allow other corporate entities to carry forward and offset tax losses against those of companies in the same group. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date – defining incorporated societies as a “special corporate entity” Clauses 65(26), 65(29) and 65(30) Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submission supports the proposal to define incorporated societies as a “special corporate entity” to allow them to carry forward tax losses and offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group. However, the application period for including incorporated societies in the definition of “specified corporate entity” should be simplified to be the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. The intended requirement that the assessment is not time barred should be removed, except in relation to the amendment to the Income Tax Act 1976 which should remain effective for the period from 1992-93 to 1994-95 subject to the time bar. 131 Comment The loss carry forward rules were redrafted in 1992 to introduce the new ownership tests of voting and market value interests to determine a person’s interest in a company. An unintended outcome was that incorporated societies that did not issue shares were no longer able to access the loss carry forward rules due to their inability to satisfy the new ownership tests. As a result, some incorporated societies incorrectly applied the loss rules, while others correctly applied the law. The proposed amendments in the bill ensure that incorporated societies that do not issue shares are able to carry forward losses and offset such losses against income earned in future income years. This rule existed prior to the redrafting of the loss carry forward rules and, therefore, the proposed amendment applies retrospectively to the 1992-93 income year. Incorporated societies will also be able to offset their income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group. The previous legislation did not provide for such offsets. However, officials are aware of some incorporated societies that did offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group. The retrospective application of the proposed amendment will prevent the Commissioner from denying such group offsets and thereby protect the tax position adopted by some incorporated societies. The rationale for providing a four-year period in which an incorporated society can use the proposed amendment to amend its returns to offset such losses is to limit the potential revenue and administrative implications associated with the retrospective application of the amendment. The purpose of the proposed application date, in relation to allowing for offset by companies in the same group, was to provide that all incorporated societies could apply the proposed amendment to any assessment that was not subject to the time bar for the Commissioner to amend the assessment. However, officials acknowledge the point made in the submission: that the current application provisions may be unworkable in the way they interact with the statute bar date provisions. Officials therefore consider that the amendments allowing incorporated societies to offset income and losses against the income and losses of companies in the same group in past years should be retrospective to the 1992-93 income year, to protect the position adopted by an incorporated society if it filed on that basis. However, if an incorporated society did not file on that basis, it would be able to amend its return to take advantage of the proposed amendments for the 2000-01 and subsequent years. Recommendation That the submission be declined but the proposed application date be redrafted to allow: • retrospective application to the 1992-93 income year for incorporated societies that filed on the basis of group offset; and • retrospective application to the 2000-01 income year for those incorporated societies that have not filed on that basis. 132 Issue: Application date – the offsetting of losses between commonly owned incorporated societies Clause 67 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The provision that allows commonly owned incorporated societies to offset their income and losses should apply for the 1995-96 and all subsequent income years, and not be restricted to the income years from 1997-98 to 2002-03. Comment Officials consider that treating incorporated societies that do not issue shares as special corporate entities is the correct policy outcome, as it is consistent with the rationale for the special corporate entity concept. The special corporate entity concept and associated rules were introduced to deal with entities that do not issue shares or have ultimate natural person shareholders. Without the special corporate entity concept, this lack of easily-identified owners would create major problems for the application of some of the standard company tax rules such as carry forward and grouping losses. The members or directors of a special corporate entity are deemed to be a single person (and not a company) holding all the shares and options over shares in the entity and holding nothing but rights over the entity. Therefore no breach of shareholder continuity is possible in respect of the special corporate entity or its subsidiaries. By the same token, a special corporate entity can group only with its own subsidiaries, because there is no look-through to the individual owners or members of the incorporated society on which common ownership would be determined. Grouping for loss offsets requires common ownership. Clause 67 has been proposed to deal with a specific situation where a set of incorporated societies and their subsidiaries “grouped” their losses and income on the basis of common membership. The taxpayer contends that tax rules treated membership rights as shares for the purposes of the tax loss rules. The Commissioner contends that they did not. However, the proposal – retrospectively allowing grouping in this situation for a relatively brief period – provides a pragmatic resolution for this dispute. In discussions with the parties involved, they have accepted that the special corporate entity concept is the appropriate approach going forward. Officials are not aware of other situations that need to be covered by the application date of this provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 133 Issue: Shares in deemed companies should be deemed to carry all shareholder decision-making rights Clause 67 Submission (14 – Russell McVeagh) Proposed new section OD 3(4) will provide that, if no shares have been issued by the incorporated society, the incorporated society will be deemed to have issued shares to its members and these shares will carry all the shareholder decision-making rights. This will result in the creation of a voting interest that can be used to allow the incorporated society to offset income and losses against those of its commonly owned incorporated societies. A similar provision is required to make it explicit that the shares deemed to be issued by a company that is deemed to exist under section OE 3 carry all the shareholder decision-making rights in the deemed company. Under section OE 3, a non-resident life insurer can elect for its New Zealand life insurance business to be treated as carried on by company resident in New Zealand. Comment Officials consider that the proposed amendment should not be included as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, as further analysis is required to identify any risks or unintended consequences associated with the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage. Officials recommend that this work be added to the government’s tax policy work programme and prioritised as resources permit. 134 CONFIRMATION OF ANNUAL INCOME TAX RATES Clause 3 Issue: Reduction in the tax-to-GDP ratio and in overall tax rates Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) Business New Zealand submits that the tax-to-GDP ratio and tax rates overall should be reduced, requiring lower government expenditure relative to GDP. It argues that the “headline” company tax rate should be reduced over time to 20%, and that this would not have a significant revenue cost. KPMG submits that the corporate tax rate should be lowered to a rate that is competitive with those of its neighbours, and personal marginal tax rates lowered and aligned with the corporate tax rate. Both submissions argue that current tax rates constrain New Zealand’s international competitiveness, appeal to investors and economic growth. Comment The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in Schedule 1 of the Act to be confirmed each year. It has been a long-standing practice of Parliament to confirm the tax rates annually. The bill provides that the annual income tax rates for the 2004-05 income year will be the same as the rates that applied for the 2003-04 income year. The rates being confirmed reflect the government’s policy on the rates of income tax it wishes to levy on businesses and taxpayers. The government’s main concern in setting rates has been to generate sufficient revenue to meet its policy commitments. In regard to Business New Zealand’s proposal for a 20% corporate tax rate, removing the alignment between the current corporate tax rate and the middle personal tax rate would come at a cost in terms of revenue, administration and compliance. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 135 Issue: Need for empirical international evidence to support New Zealand’s current tax rates Submission (27 – KPMG) New Zealand should undertake a comparative analysis of income tax and economic growth rates in comparable foreign jurisdictions to ensure that New Zealand’s rates are achieving the best possible trade-off between government revenue and private sector investment. Comment The Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development are already researching the many influences on growth rates internationally, including the impact of tax systems. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inflation-adjustment of tax rate thresholds Submission (27 – KPMG) New Zealand’s personal marginal tax rate thresholds and other thresholds (such as de minimis rules) in the Revenue Acts should be inflation-adjusted now and on an on- going basis. By not inflation-adjusting marginal tax rate thresholds the government is effectively increasing tax rates and increasing its revenue as wages increase. This is incongruous with the inflation-adjustment of such things as excise taxes. Comment The rates being confirmed reflect the government’s policy on the rates of income tax it wishes to levy on businesses and taxpayers. Changing tax thresholds involves a number of costs such as changing PAYE tables and accounting systems, so it should not occur frequently. Changes in thresholds can be more complex than is implied by the submission. (For example, the current straightforward relationship between the low income rebate, the $9,500 threshold, and the $38,000 threshold would be complicated by inflation-adjustment.) Furthermore, if revenue is sufficient to adjust for inflation, alternative changes to tax schedules may offer better outcomes that deal with changes other than just the price level. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 136 PENALTIES APPLICABLE TO NON-RESIDENT CONTRACTOR IF TOTAL DOUBLE TAX RELIEF APPLIES Clauses 106, 107, 118 and 119 Issue: Support for the lower penalty contained in the proposal Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the lower penalty provisions contained in the proposal. Comment The submission supports the proposal as a positive measure to reduce the compliance burden imposed by the non-resident contractors’ withholding tax regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Section 141AA should not be enacted Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section 141AA should not be enacted, because it would be illogical to impose a penalty on an employer who does not deduct a withholding tax that, ultimately, will always be refundable to the non-resident contractor. Comment The proposal does not introduce a new penalty; it limits an existing penalty. Where no certificate of exemption is obtained, but the non-resident contractor is exempt from all tax under a double tax agreement or otherwise, the New Zealand employer is required to withhold tax. The non-resident contractor can claim this amount withheld as a credit against its taxable income by filing an income tax return in New Zealand. If the New Zealand employer does not withhold the required tax then penalties apply to the employer. 137 The proposed section 141AA will restrict the amount of penalty payable in these situations to $250 per incorrectly filed employer monthly schedule with a cap of $1,000. This limitation is necessary because it recognises that the non-resident will be exempt from paying tax in New Zealand. The Inland Revenue Department, however, still needs the information connected with the activities of the non-resident contractor for tax audit and enforcement purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Filing requirement imposed as an alternative to the penalty Submission (10W – Business New Zealand, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) As an alternative to the proposed penalty contained in section 141AA, there should be a requirement that information is filed with the Inland Revenue Department. Comment The submission assumes that taxpayers will comply with the proposed information filing requirement if no penalty is imposed for not doing so. There is currently a mechanism for filing information where no penalty arises. Where the non-resident contractor applies for an exemption certificate the New Zealand employer is exempt from the withholding requirement in this context. This is essentially a filing requirement with no penalty. However, in the event that a certificate is not filed, some enforcement mechanism should exist. Rather than imposing a late filing penalty, the exemption from withholding is removed. There is another opportunity for taxpayers to comply without incurring any penalty. If the withholding obligations are complied with, no penalty will arise. However, where taxpayers fail to utilise both these opportunities to avoid the imposition of a penalty, some enforcement mechanism is required if the non-resident contractors’ tax is to work effectively. The non-resident contractors’ tax has a high risk of non-compliance. The proposal to apply a penalty for not filing is premised on the assumption that non-compliance will continue in the absence of an enforcement mechanism. The penalty is similar to a late filing penalty. 138 The submission from KPMG proposed that the penalty be remitted in the event that the information is provided. However, the point of the penalty is to ensure that the information is provided in a timely manner. If this is done then no penalty will arise. However, if the information is not provided in a timely manner its usefulness is eroded. The penalty is therefore required to ensure that the information is provided on a timely basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to “contract payment” or “withholding payment” Submission (27 – KPMG) Section 141AA should refer to “contract payment” rather than “withholding payment” when referring to the payment from the New Zealand employer to the non-resident contractor. Comment The submission is technically correct. The term used in the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 is “contract payment”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reference to non-resident contractors’ income tax liability Submission (27 – KPMG) Section 141AA(1) should refer to the non-resident contractor’s income tax liability in New Zealand as opposed to the contractor’s liability to pay tax on the withholding payment. Comment Officials agree that the payer’s liability to deduct tax from a contract payment and pay it to the Commissioner should be more clearly distinguished from the non-resident contractor’s liability in respect of the payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 Issue: Limitation of application to double tax agreements Submission (27 – KPMG) The penalty should not be limited to non-resident contractors who are exempt from all tax under a double tax agreement, but should apply in all cases where the non-resident contractor is completely exempt from paying tax in New Zealand. Comment There is no policy reason why the penalty should apply only in situations where the non-resident is exempt from tax under a double tax agreement. The policy underlying the proposal is to reduce a more onerous penalty from applying in situations where no tax is ultimately payable by the non-resident contractor. The proposed penalty should therefore apply in all situations where the non-resident contractor is completely exempt from tax in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 140 TAX SHORTFALLS – LOSS ATTRIBUTING QUALIFYING COMPANIES Clauses 109 and 110 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The Institute supports this change because this approach better reflects the underlying policy intent of the loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) regime. Comment To the extent that an adjustment reduces a net loss of an LAQC, any penalties will be charged to the shareholder, not the company. If the shareholder has not claimed a deduction for the attributed loss, no penalty will be charged. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Tax shortfalls – shareholders acting in good faith Clauses 109 and 110 Submission (10W – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand supports the amendment, but questions the need to penalise shareholders who may be acting in good faith. Comment The courts have recently held that both the company and the shareholder takes a tax position where losses are attributed to a shareholder. The shareholder, therefore, has a responsibility to ensure that he or she has taken an acceptable tax position. If the tax position proves to be unacceptable, the shareholder should be treated in the same way as any other person who has taken such a tax position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 141 Issue: Tax shortfalls – penalise the company in the first instance Clause 110 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed provision should charge the LAQC with the shortfall penalty in the first instance, as opposed to the shareholders. Comment Officials have no particular preference in relation to whom the penalty should be applied. However, we consulted with ICANZ, who have a strong preference for the penalty to be charged to the shareholder. Further, such a change would involve unilaterally extending the LAQC shareholder tax guarantee, as the submitter acknowledges. Such a change should be the subject of explicit consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting clarification Clause 110 Submission (27 KPMG) Proposed section 141FD(1)(a) should refer to a shareholder of the loss attributing qualifying company on any day in the income year in relation to which the company had the net loss that was attributed to the taxpayer. Comment A net loss is generally not determined until the full year’s position is determined, usually after the end of the particular year. It is not correct, therefore, to refer to the income year “in which” the company had the loss, and the bill should be amended to refer to an income year for which the company had the loss. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 Issue: Tax shortfalls – drafting issue Clause 110 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The provision should consistently use the term “shareholder” rather than interchange between “shareholder” and “person”. Recommendation That the drafting be made consistent. Issue: Tax shortfalls – application date Clause 110 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed provision should apply retrospectively from 1 April 1998. Comment Officials are aware of a number of cases where the current law is being relied on. Accordingly, making this provision retrospective to 1 April 1998 is not appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax shortfalls – application date inconsistency Clause 110 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commentary states that the amendment will apply to shortfalls that relate to periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. However, clause 110(2) states that the amendment will apply to shortfall penalties imposed on or after 1 April 2005. 143 Comment The intention is that the provision apply to shortfalls that relate to periods starting on or after 1 April 2005. Recommendation That the application date in the bill be amended to reflect the intention as stated in the Commentary. Issue: Tax shortfalls – voluntary disclosure of shortfalls Clauses 109 and 110 Submission (29W – Murray Harden) If LAQCs qualify for a reduction of penalties because of a voluntary disclosure, this reduction should automatically flow through to shareholders. Comment This submission was received very late, and officials have had insufficient time to work through all the implications. Recommendation That the submission be declined at this stage, but full analysis will be undertaken by officials, with a view to amending the legislation, if appropriate, in the future. Officials will liaise with the submitter on this matter. 144 SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER – OFFSHORE UNIT TRUSTS Issue: Over-taxation of New Zealand investors investing through pooled investment vehicles Submission (15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 23W – Money Managers Limited) The proposals do not address the fundamental problem in this area, which is the over- taxation of New Zealanders that save through New Zealand pooled investment vehicles. Comment Officials agree that New Zealand resident investors can face over-taxation if they invest via a New Zealand pooled investment vehicle such as a unit trust. One of the main reasons for this is that the investment vehicle will generally be taxed on the profits it derives from the sale of its investments (such as shares), on the basis that such profits comprise its business income. The imposition of tax on the investment vehicle’s business profits will reduce the ultimate return to the investor. New Zealand investors that invest directly rather than through a pooled investment vehicle will generally not pay tax on the profits they derive from the sale of investments such as shares. This is because the individual investor will not generally be in the business of investing in the underlying investments. This distinction between the tax treatment of pooled and direct investment means that the tax system can be said to encourage individuals to invest directly rather than through a pooled fund. There are also a number of other problems with the tax treatment of New Zealand pooled investment vehicles. These include the various different tax rules that can apply depending on the particular vehicle invested into and the problem of the vehicle’s tax rate being different to those of its ultimate investors. The government is aware of these problems and has announced a review of the tax rules that apply in this area. A key aspect of this review is working with industry stakeholders in an attempt to ascertain what they see as the key problems and whether a consensus is emerging on an approach to address these problems. An independent private sector expert, Craig Stobo, is coordinating this work and is due to report to the Minister of Finance and Revenue on options for reform in October this year. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 145 Issue: Uncertainty with the vesting rule Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 18A – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed section CF 2(1)(ib) provides that a dividend includes “income or property of a unit trust in which a beneficial interest vests absolutely in a unit holder”. It is submitted that the term “vests absolutely in interest” is a trust term and to introduce it to the unit trust tax area would create uncertainty. ISI suggests further that it is ...very difficult in logic and at law to tax income, that is already deemed to be gross income derived by a company, to the shareholders as beneficiary income, then try and deem that to be a dividend. Although the Courts could arguably force the rule to work, the tension between the trust regimes and company regime is likely to cause unnecessary uncertainty. There is also a concern that the proposals could inadvertently prohibit New Zealand resident unit trusts making non-taxable bonus issues even though there is no revenue leakage from these unit trusts. It is submitted, therefore, that the proposed vesting rule should be limited to offshore unit trusts. Comment Officials do not agree that there would be a general problem in applying the proposed vesting rule to New Zealand unit trusts. An amount that vests absolutely in the beneficiary of a unit trust is almost certainly already treated as a dividend under section CF 2(1)(a). The proposed section CF 2(1)(ib) makes this absolutely clear. The effect of the provision is not to deem an amount to be “beneficiary income” and then deem that amount to be a dividend. Instead, its effect is to treat an amount that has been identified by trust law as a dividend for income tax. However, officials accept that New Zealand unit trusts are not the intended target of the proposed rules as they are fully taxable on both their New Zealand sourced and non-New Zealand sourced income. Further, we are not aware of any circumstances where the proposed vesting rule would change the tax treatment of distributions from New Zealand unit trusts. Therefore, officials agree with the submitters’ conclusion that the proposed vesting rule should be limited to offshore unit trusts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 Issue: Uncertainty with the vesting rule Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The term “vests absolutely in interest” is not widely understood outside New Zealand trust tax rules and is not common commercial usage in relation to unit trusts. This, it is suggested, may give rise to uncertainty as to how the vesting rule in the proposed section CF 2(1)(ib) would operate in practice. The daily unit pricing of units in a unit trust is an example that submitters suggest could give rise to an unintended vesting. It is submitted, therefore, that the proposed vesting rule should be limited to offshore unit trusts. Comment Officials do not consider that the practice of daily unit pricing would give rise to a vesting. The daily unit pricing is a re-calculation of the value of the units held in the unit trust. The process for achieving this is to (i) revalue the underlying assets of the unit trust (this valuation includes realised and unrealised gains); and (ii) divide the value of the underlying units by the number of units on issue. This calculation provides an updated unit price. A vesting does not occur simply when the unit price is recalculated. A vesting requires the beneficial interest in the property or income to move from the general pool of unit trust assets to the individual beneficiary. This can only occur through the action of the trustee pursuant to the trust deed. However, officials accept that New Zealand unit trusts are not the intended target of the proposed rules as they are fully taxable on both their New Zealand sourced and non-New Zealand sourced income. Further, we are not aware of any circumstances where the proposed vesting rule would change the tax treatment of distributions from New Zealand unit trusts. Therefore officials agree with the submitters’ conclusion that the proposed vesting rule should be limited to offshore unit trusts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 147 Issue: Vesting rule is unnecessary and should be repealed Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The submission considers that it is a: ...well understood point of NZ tax law that the vesting of an absolute beneficial interest in property of a trust in a beneficiary is treated as a transfer of effective ownership of that property. In a unit trust context, such an absolute vesting is clearly a distribution by the unit trust to a unitholder. It is further suggested it is equally clear that such a vesting is caught by the broad wording of section CF 2(1)(a) and is, therefore, already treated as a dividend. It is submitted that the attempted clarification in section CF 2(1)(ib) of something that is already clear is confusing and should not be proceeded with. Comment While officials consider that it is almost certain that an amount that vests absolutely in a beneficiary is already treated as a dividend under section CF 2(1)(a), we also consider that this should be put beyond doubt. That is, for the proposed provisions to deal effectively with Australian unit trust (AUT) structures it is vital that a vesting from a unit trust is treated as a dividend. If it could be argued that such a vesting was not currently treated as a dividend, the AUT structures could still provide an opportunity for New Zealand resident investors to minimise or eliminate tax on their investments. This could be achieved by the AUT vesting an amount of income absolutely in the New Zealand resident beneficiary. This would result in the income not being taxed in Australia and, if the amount that was vested was not a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes, the amount would not be taxed in New Zealand. It would not be necessary for the vesting to be accompanied by the issue of a new unit. The vested amount would simply be reflected in a higher value for existing units. If the New Zealand resident beneficiary held such units on capital account, this additional value could be realised as a tax-free capital gain when the unit was eventually sold. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 148 Issue: Potential double taxation when amount that vests is issued as a bonus issue Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) When bonus units are issued to unit holders it is likely that the units issued will include amounts that have already vested absolutely in unit holders and, therefore, have already been taxed as dividends. In other words, an amount that vests absolutely will be taxed as a dividend once and, potentially, again when the amount vested is issued as a bonus unit. Comment The scenario described in the submission is one where an amount that has vested absolutely in the unit holder is used as consideration for the issue of new units. This is equivalent to a purchase of units. In a situation where units are purchased, the new units will not meet the definition of a dividend. Therefore double taxation will not occur in the scenario described. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Bonus issue rule is flawed and should be repealed Submission (27 – KPMG) The rule that renders a bonus issue taxable if there is an arrangement to issue the unit instead of distributing money is flawed and should be repealed (the proposed new paragraph (c) of the definition of “taxable bonus issue”). It is suggested that it is difficult to envisage a situation where a trustee could make a bonus issue of units that has not vested absolutely in the beneficiary. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission. Aside from a “bonus issue in lieu”, the definition of “bonus issue” requires that the company issuing the unit or share does not receive consideration for the issue. If a unit trust vests an amount in a beneficiary and this amount is then reinvested in new units, it would seem clear that the company has received consideration for the issue. A unit issued under these circumstances would, therefore, not satisfy the definition of “bonus issue”. 149 The proposed amendment is not aimed at this scenario. The proposal is designed to address a situation where a unit is issued and no consideration passes from the beneficiary to the unit trust at the time the unit is issued. For example, a common feature of the AUT structures is an agreement, when units of a particular class are purchased, to receive future distributions as additional units rather than cash. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Unintended consequences of bonus issue rule Submission (22W – Westpac Banking Corporation of New Zealand, 7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – KPMG) The proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” should not apply where a bonus issue is made by a New Zealand resident unit trust for the purpose of providing a fee rebate. The fee rebate mechanism is explained very clearly in the Westpac submission. Management fee rebates are provided for certain investors in unit trusts that, for example, hold fund balances that exceed a certain level. The mechanism by which the rebate is achieved is to reduce the total management fee paid by the unit trust by an amount equal to these fee reductions. The additional cash retained in the unit trust is vested in the appropriate investors’ accounts via regular issues of additional units. These take the form of “non-taxable bonus issues”. It is very likely that these bonus issues will be caught by the new rule and rendered taxable bonus issues. Submitters suggest that one solution to address this issue is to limit the application of the bonus issue rule to offshore unit trusts. Comment Officials agree that the provision of rebates in the form of additional units may, in certain situations, be caught by the proposed addition of paragraph (c) to the definition of “taxable bonus issue”. This is because, in a fee rebate scenario, there could be “an arrangement or decision that the unit trust will make the bonus issue instead of causing a beneficial interest in money... to vest absolutely in the unit holder”. The intention of the new rules is not to change the current tax treatment of this type of fee rebates. Whether or not it is appropriate to tax the issue of a new unit in the situations described above is, therefore, not an issue that should be addressed by the proposed rules. For these reasons we agree with the submitters and recommend that the proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” be limited to offshore unit trusts. 150 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” be limited to offshore unit trusts. Issue: Unintended consequences of bonus issue rule Submission (22W – Westpac Banking Corporation of New Zealand, 7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – KPMG) Retail unit trusts often use wholesale unit trusts to invest on their behalf. A wholesale unit trust offers obvious advantages, including the ability to make larger and more diverse investments. Before section DI 3B was enacted, a problem arose for retail unit trusts that invested in wholesale unit trusts because expenses incurred at the retail level were not able to be deducted. This is because the retail unit trust received only fully imputed dividends from the wholesale unit trust. Section DI 3B addresses the issue by allowing the retail unit trust to transfer expense deductions up to the wholesale unit trust. The wholesale unit trust generally pays for the expense deductions by the issue of additional units, rather than consideration in cash. It is suggested that the issue of units as consideration for such expense deduction transfers should not be caught as a taxable bonus issue under the new rule. Submitters suggest that this could be achieved by confining the application of the proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” to offshore unit trusts. Comment Officials agree that the provision of units by a wholesale unit trust as payment for expense deductions that it receives from its retail unit trust investors may, in certain situations, be caught by the proposed addition of paragraph (c) to the definition of “taxable bonus issue”. The intention of the new rules is not to change the current tax treatment of expense transfers between retail and wholesale unit trusts. For these reasons we agree with the submitters and recommend that the proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” be limited to offshore unit trusts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the proposed addition to the definition of “taxable bonus issue” be limited to offshore unit trusts. 151 Issue: Expenditure incurred by a company in deriving exempt dividends Submission (24 – BNZ Investment Management, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – KPMG, 18A – Corporate Taxpayer Group) Following the proposed reform, the treatment of certain bonus issues of units from unit trusts will change from non-taxable in nature to taxable dividends. For a company that holds units in such a unit trust, this will result in the issue of those units being treated as exempt dividends under section CB 10(1) and, therefore, subject to a dividend withholding payment (DWP) deduction of 33%. Expenditure incurred by the New Zealand resident company in deriving the exempt dividends is not likely to be tax-deductible as the expenditure was incurred to derive exempt income (section BD 2(2)(b)). The submitters suggest that this result is inappropriate as the expenditure is incurred in deriving an amount that is subject to a deduction (the DWP) that is equivalent to the imposition of tax. It is therefore submitted that expenditure incurred by a company to derive DWP should be made fully tax-deductible. Comment Officials have been aware of this problem for some time and the issue is currently on the government’s tax policy work programme. Clearly, from a policy perspective, a full deduction should be allowed where the income is fully subject to either New Zealand income tax or DWP. However, if a New Zealand resident company derives a dividend from a non-resident company, situations can arise where the dividend is not subject to full New Zealand tax or full DWP. Allowing a full deduction in these situations would give rise to an inappropriate result. For example, consider a New Zealand resident company that is 100% owned by non- New Zealand residents that derives a foreign dividend. In this situation, the conduit tax rules will generally apply and would reduce the DWP liability of the New Zealand resident company to zero. When the New Zealand resident company distributes the amount represented by the dividend to the foreign company, this flow will generally only be subject to non-resident withholding tax at 15%. Allowing a full deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving the exempt dividend in this situation is inappropriate from a tax policy perspective. Officials recommend, therefore, that a deduction be allowed for expenditure incurred by a company deriving dividends that are exempt under section CB 10(1) to the extent that DWP on the dividends is not relieved by the conduit tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and a deduction be allowed for expenditure incurred by a company deriving dividends that are exempt under section CB 10(1) to the extent that DWP on the dividends is not relieved by the conduit tax rules. 152 Issue: Rules necessary to determine value of the bonus issue Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – KPMG) If a dividend arises from a bonus issue, valuation rules are necessary to determine the amount of the dividend. Two approaches seem possible (i) valuation by reference to the underlying income (ii) valuation by reference to the value of the bonus issue to the beneficiary. In the absence of a valuation rule, unit trusts can utilise a mechanism in section CF 8 to determine the amount of the taxable dividend arising from the bonus issue. If the section CF 8 method of valuation remained available, unit trusts could elect to value the units at a nominal amount. This, it is suggested, is not an outcome that the government would regard as appropriate. Comment Officials agree with this submission. As the submissions correctly point out, if the proposal did not include rules to value the bonus issue it may be unclear as to what value is to be attributed to the unit. In addition, unless the ability to determine a value under section CF 8 is removed for these units, it would be open for unit trusts to value the units at a nominal amount. Officials recommend, therefore, that the current proposals be amended to remove taxable bonus issues that arise under the proposal from section CF 8. It is also recommended that valuation rules be included that would value taxable bonus issues that arise under the proposal by reference to the amount of money or property which would have vested in the unit holder had the arrangement referred to in the taxable bonus issue definition not been entered into. This is consistent with the approach adopted for valuing a “bonus issue in lieu” in section CF 2(6). Recommendation That section CF 8 be amended so that a taxable bonus issue arising under the proposal will not be able to be valued under section CF 8. That a valuation rule is enacted that would provide that the amount of the taxable dividend arising from this type of taxable bonus issue is calculated by reference to the amount of money or property which would have vested in the unit holder had the arrangement referred to in the taxable bonus issue definition not been entered into. 153 Issue: Potential double taxation if units held on revenue account Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A unit holder that holds the units on revenue account receives a unit that is a “taxable bonus issue” under the proposal, there is a risk of double taxation. The unit will be taxed as a dividend when it is derived and, unless a cost base is provided, could be taxed again when it is sold. Comment Officials agree that the current tax rules could be interpreted to result in double taxation for unit holders that hold their units on revenue account. A simple example illustrates the point. Johnny is in the business of investing in shares and other equities. This means that, generally, the profits that Johnny makes on the sale of his shares and units will be treated as part of his taxable business income. Essentially, Johnny’s profits are calculated by deducting the cost of the property from the gross proceeds on sale. In tax year 1 Johnny derives an issue of new units from an AUT that is treated as a taxable bonus issue under the proposals. The value of the “taxable bonus issue” is NZD$100,000. In tax year 3 Johnny sells these units to a third party for $200,000. Double taxation could occur in this example if Johnny was taxed on the full $200,000 that he derives from the sale in tax year 3. This is because Johnny has already paid tax on the $100,000 taxable bonus issue in tax year 1. The solution to the potential double taxation is to provide Johnny with a tax deduction (or a cost base) for the $100,000 in tax year 3 that can be offset against the $200,000. This issue currently arises for existing bonus issues. The current practice is to assume that a cost base arises that is equal to the initial bonus issue. Assuming a cost base in this manner provides the correct policy result. The Tax Information Bulletin item published following the enactment of this proposal will confirm this treatment. Therefore, given that the correct result is currently occurring in practice, officials do not consider that a law change to deem a cost base is necessary at this stage. However, if this issue gives rise to practical problems in the future, officials would recommend such an amendment. Recommendation That no amendment is required at this stage. 154 Issue: Changes to section CF 3(2)(c) Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The “taxable bonus issue” is regarded as an amount “paid” by the unit holder in obtaining the units for the purposes of section CF 3(2)(c) in order to ensure that an appropriate amount of “available subscribed capital” (ASC) arises. Comment ASC is the amount of shareholders’ funds that have been paid for the issue of a company’s shares. The amount of ASC per share is significant because it represents the shareholders’ funds that can ultimately be returned to the shareholder tax-free. A “taxable bonus issue” under the proposed new rule will be taxed as a dividend when it is derived. It is therefore appropriate to include this amount in the ASC per share. The method for determining the ASC per share for unlisted foreign widely-held trusts is contained in section CF 3(2)(c)(ii). Essentially, this provision provides that the ASC per share is equal to the amount paid for the share (in situations where the shareholder cannot obtain sufficient information to calculate that amount). Therefore officials agree with submitters that section CF 3(2)(c)(ii) should be amended so that the “taxable bonus issue” is treated as an amount “paid”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Limit provision to situations where there is a reduction of foreign tax Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The new bonus issue rule should render the issue of a unit taxable if the unit trust pays no tax on the distributed income as a result having made the distribution. The following draft is suggested: “a bonus issue that is made by a unit trust if, as a result of making the bonus issue, the unit trust is liable to pay no income tax in relation to any part of an amount from which the bonus issue is sourced.” 155 Comment Conceptually, there is some merit to this approach as it focuses on the mischief apparent in the AUT structures – that is, a reduction or elimination of tax paid in New Zealand and Australia. The proposal in the bill takes a different approach by focusing on bonus issues that arise out of what are, essentially, dividend reinvestment schemes. The rationale for this approach is that if there has been an arrangement at the outset for the unit holder to receive additional units instead of a distribution of cash, this is in substance akin to the unit holder agreeing to have dividends reinvested in new units. The distributions that are reinvested in new units under such dividend reinvestment schemes are currently taxed as dividends. The current proposal takes a similar approach but, instead, treats the issue of new units as a “taxable bonus issue”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date – grandparenting existing investments Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed changes should not apply to distributions from unit trusts in respect of arrangements that were already in existence on 11 May 2004, which have a finite life and where investors are not free to withdraw without adverse consequences. While the amendments would be prospective in effect, the changes will affect adversely investments to which investors have committed irrevocably. Such investors are often effectively locked into such investments until well after the date that the proposals are due to take effect. Comment The submission is essentially suggesting that investors that have entered certain schemes before the date that the current proposals were tabled should continue to be able to benefit from the tax-advantaged nature of these investments. Officials disagree with this submission. It is clearly reasonable for investors, as a general rule, to have an expectation that tax laws will not change retrospectively. However, an expectation that there will be no change during the life of a particular investment is not reasonable. 156 In addition, investors have had significant notice that a change was likely. Public statements by the Minister of Finance and Revenue as far back as August 2003 have signalled clearly the government’s intention to amend the tax law relating to AUTs and remove the advantage. The intervening period has provided investors with sufficient opportunity to reorganise their affairs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date should be 1 April 2005 Submission (7A – Investment, Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 15A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 18A – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 20W – New Zealand Funds, 27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed changes should take effect from 1 April 2005. Applying the changes from the beginning of a new tax year would prevent a situation where an investor with a 31 March balance date would, for the current income tax year, be required to calculate dividend income pre- and post-application date. In addition, an application date occurring during the current income year could result in certain investors becoming provisional taxpayers, or being required to reassess their current provisional tax liability. Also, investors should be given more time to understand the changes and their implications. A 1 April 2005 application date would provide investors with sufficient time to organise (i) an exit from the AUT investment if desired and (ii) how they will meet any additional tax that may arise as a result of the proposed changes. A 1 April 2005 application date would provide unit trusts and financial advisers with sufficient time to make the necessary system changes, amend the literature and rethink strategies. The submissions acknowledge implicitly that a delayed application date may give rise to some risk to the revenue. However, it is noted that AUTs will generally distribute at the end of June each year, being the end of the Australian tax year. Comment The bill provides that the proposed amendments will apply from the date that the bill receives its Royal assent. This is likely to be in about October this year. 157 Officials acknowledge that an October application date could give rise to some issues for individual investors in AUTs. As the submissions note, individual investors could be faced with doing two tax calculations (one pre-change and one post-change) for the current income year, as well as potential provisional tax difficulties. Addressing these issues would delay the application of the proposals until the start of the next income year – 1 April 2005. The issue of compliance costs for investors should, however, be weighed against the fact that certain industry players acted in reliance on the Minister of Finance and Revenue’s warnings that the tax advantage would be removed and did not market AUT products (see the ASB submission below). Officials understand that these industry players have already suffered a significant competitive disadvantage by not developing AUT products. The longer that the tax advantage remains, the longer these players will continue to suffer this disadvantage. In addition, investors have had significant notice that a change was likely. Public statements by the Minister of Finance and Revenue as far back as August 2003 have signalled clearly the government’s intention to amend the tax law relating to AUTs and remove the advantage. The intervening period has provided investors with sufficient opportunity to reorganise their affairs. On balance, officials consider that the compliance cost advantage of delaying the application of the new rules until 1 April 2005 is outweighed by concerns over the competitive disadvantage faced by those fund managers that have decided not to market AUT products and the fact that investors have had significant notice of these changes. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application date should be 1 July 2004 Submission (25W – ASB Group) The proposals should be implemented from 1 July 2004, being the commencement of the 2005 Australian tax year. The Minister first announced an intention to close this loophole in August 2003. ASB suggests that those members of the industry that acted in reliance on the Minister’s warning and did not launch AUT products have suffered a significant commercial disadvantage. Therefore to delay the application of the proposed changes to the date of Royal assent (probably around November this year) would, it is suggested, extend this commercial advantage unreasonably. 158 ASB describes how it has been commercially disadvantaged by acting in reliance of the Minister’s statements. ASB notes that it has abandoned AUT products that, prior to the Minister’s announcement, it was ready to launch. It estimates that around 50 percent of the industry players would, like ASB, be further disadvantaged by any further delay to the application of the new rules. ASB also downplays the extent that the industry would incur significant compliance costs as a result of a 1 July 2004 application date. That is, it suggests that the unit trusts have ample time to develop reports providing details of the bonus issues made during the year ended 31 March 2005. The reports would not have to be provided to the New Zealand investors until April or May 2005, giving investors sufficient time to complete tax returns by 7 July 2005. Comment Officials understand ASB’s concern that a number of industry players have suffered a competitive disadvantage by acting in reliance on the Minister of Finance and Revenue’s public statements and not marketing AUT products to their clients. However, we disagree with the proposal to apply the rules from 1 July 2004 as this would constitute retrospective application. In addition, for the reasons explained above, we consider that a date of Royal assent application date for the new rules is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 159 SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER – FEBRUARY STORM ISSUES The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and Federated Farmers of New Zealand (Inc) strongly support the proposals to assist businesses affected by the February storm, but they have raised some issues. Issue: Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004, destroyed buildings, destroyed farming land improvements, and donated trading stock Clauses 14C, 18C and 23B Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 28 & 28A – Federated Farmers of New Zealand (Inc)) The Institute seeks a commitment that a larger review will be undertaken in these areas of tax legislation. Federated Farmers seek to extend the application of the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 and also to widen the application of the proposed legislation to include other adverse climatic events, rather than only the February storm event. Comment The Institute seeks a wider review because it believes that broader consideration of these issues is needed before the provisions can be extended to other situations. It considers that such a review would be reasonably complex and could not be completed in time for inclusion in the bill. We agree with that view. Federated Farmers consider that the relief measures enacted in the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 should be extended to more localised events and events that occur in sparsely populated areas. They also state that the amendments proposed in the SOP that relate to deductions for destroyed buildings, destroyed land improvements and donated trading stock should be extended to apply to a wider range of adverse climatic events rather than only to the February storms. Federated Farmers are also concerned that the relief afforded to donated trading stock in relation to the February storm would not be available if the transaction is identified subsequently in a tax audit. While amendments to the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 are outside the scope of the SOP, we agree that there may be some merit in reconsidering the application of that legislation. However, as is the case with extending the provisions in the SOP to events outside the February storm, further consultation is required, and it is necessary to consider issues that did not arise in the February storm. For example, in general, the trading stock donated as a result of the February storm was not donated to associated parties but to non-profit organisations who will subsequently distribute the donations. That may not be the case in a future event, and a different mechanism will be required to address donations to associated parties. 160 The measures in the SOP aim to provide certainty for taxpayers affected by the February storms without prejudging the outcome of a wider review. For example, the SOP makes it clear that donations of trading stock made as a result of the February storm will not be subject to the anti-avoidance provision, regardless of whether the donation is made in a subsequent income year. A review of the treatment of losses on destroyed buildings and losses on destroyed farming land improvements is part of the current review of the depreciation rules. The treatment of donated trading stock and extending the scope of the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act can be considered for later legislation, with its work programme priority decided in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Recommendation That the submission to amend the SOP be declined, though a wider review will be undertaken of the areas of tax law covered in the SOP. Issue: Extending section EG 19(3) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EG 19(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which is being inserted by clause 14C of the SOP, should be made subject to section EG 19(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Section EG 19(3) allows a deduction for losses on disposal of some depreciable property. That provision is being extended to create a deduction for losses on disposal of buildings that were destroyed or rendered useless as a result of the February storms. The original provision is subject to the application of section EG 19(4). That qualification was inadvertently omitted when the provision was redrafted for inclusion in the SOP. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 Issue: New start grants Clauses 18B, 65, 116B and 134B Submission (28 – Federated Farmers of New Zealand (Inc)) Federated Farmers support the proposal but consider that the provision should ensure that, if in the future new start grants are provided in relation to “adverse events,” they should be treated in the same manner as those made in relation to the February storms. Comment Federated Farmers consider that recipients of new start grants in relation to future events should be automatically eligible for the relief provided by section 177D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, and they are concerned that new legislation would be needed if such grants are made in the future. If the government decides to make new start grants in the future, it will be necessary to define the triggering event in the tax legislation (as part of the definition of “adverse event” or “qualifying event”, depending on the severity of the event). Any supporting legislative changes to the definition of “new start grants” should be made at that time rather than as part of this bill because the threshold for relief under section 177D of the Tax Administration Act is relatively high, and it cannot be determined now that all future new start grants will be eligible for this type of relief. Further, new start grants are made very occasionally. The last time they were used was in the mid- 1980s. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use-of-money interest and restoration grants Submission (28 – Federated Farmers of New Zealand (Inc)) Inland Revenue should investigate measures to provide the Commissioner with power not to require use-of-money interest to be paid on any increased tax liability created by the receipt of restoration grants. 162 Comment Federated Farmers are concerned that the receipt of restorative grants could potentially give rise to unexpected use-of-money interest liabilities. Tax law requires that deductions taken for expenditure in relation to which the restorative grants are made should be reversed in the income year in which the expenditure was actually incurred. If the deduction is reversed in a year prior to which the grant was received, the tax liability for the previous year will increase, while the grant will actually not be received until the following year (or even the year after that). A positive amended assessment of income in the prior year will trigger a use-of-money interest liability. At this stage the scope of the potential problem is unclear. It is likely to be an issue only for businesses that do not have losses arising in the year in which the expenditure is made and for those where the expenditure was incurred in an income year prior to the receipt of the grant. Also, it is not clear at this stage what grants will be paid to individual businesses and when the grants will be made. We consider that more work is required to determine the scope of this potential problem before a legislative amendment can be proposed, and therefore we do not support an amendment to the bill. The issue can be considered for later legislation, with its work programme priority decided in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the issue raised in the submission will be considered further to determine whether significant tax policy issues arise. Issue: Bay of Plenty storm event Clauses 14C, 18B, 18C, 23B, 116B, and 134B Submission (Matter raised by officials) The relief mechanisms enacted as part of the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 and some of the proposals to address tax technical issues contained in Supplementary Order Paper 218 to the March Tax Bill in relation to the February 2004 storms should be extended to those affected by the recent Bay of Plenty storm event. Comment A number of tax measures have been enacted or are in the process of being enacted in response to the damage and hardship caused by the storms in February this year. 163 Similar damage and hardship, though more localised and on a smaller scale, have been caused by the recent storms in the Bay of Plenty. We have been approached by representatives of Federated Farmers Inc seeking the same tax treatment for those affected by the Bay of Plenty storm event as that being provided to those affected by the February storms. Officials agree with Federated Farmers. The extension of the relief provisions in the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 and the technical tax matters in Supplementary Order Paper number 218 to the Bay of Plenty storm event would: • allow Inland Revenue to remit interest, late payment penalties and late filing penalties for those severely affected by the Bay of Plenty storm event; • allow Inland Revenue to accept late estimates of provisional tax; • create a deduction for the tax loss on commercial buildings destroyed in the storms; • create a deduction for the tax loss on farming land improvements destroyed in the storms; • exclude gifts of trading stock and consumables, made as a result of the storms, from the anti-avoidance provision that treats them as sales and purchases at market value; and • prospectively address tax issues in relation to new start grants, should they be made in relation to the Bay of Plenty storm event. An amendment is also required to correct an oversight in the definition of “qualifying event” enacted by the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004. The definition needs to include the possibility of declarations of civil emergency made under either the Civil Defence Act 1983 or Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. Currently it only refers to declarations made under the 2002 Act. For simplicity, the amendments to provide relief from interest and penalties, which will allow late estimates of provisional tax to be made, and the remedial amendment to the definition of “qualifying event” to include declarations made under the Civil Defence Act 1983 should apply from the same time that the relevant provisions in the Taxation (Disaster Relief) Act 2004 came into force, 1 February 2004. Also for simplicity, the other measures should apply from the same time that the relevant provisions in the Supplementary Order Paper No. 218 will apply from, from the 2003- 04 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 164 165 Remedial issues 166 167 BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNTS AND LOSSES – REMEDIAL ISSUES Issue: Consequential drafting issues Submission (Matter raised by officials) The references in section MF 5(2) should be updated to take into account the changes made to the branch equivalent tax account rules by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Comment Section MF 5(2) currently refers to section MF 4(1)(a) and (b) as they were before the 2003 changes were made. An amendment should be made to align section MF 5(2) with the new section MF 4(1)(a). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 168 TRANS-TASMAN IMPUTATION – REMEDIAL ISSUES Issue: Late elections Submission (1W – Ernst & Young) Elections received by the Commissioner that are otherwise valid should apply to all dividends paid within the imputation year it is received and not just to dividends paid after the election received. This is consistent with the trans-Tasman imputation legislation generally, which allows an imputation credit account to be maintained from the beginning of the imputation year in which a valid election is received. Alternatively, should that not be acceptable, the Commissioner should be given the discretion to accept late elections that would otherwise be valid from all taxpayers in the first year of operation, and newly formed or newly eligible companies in subsequent years of operation of the rules. Comment The requirement that an election be made 30 days before the payment of a dividend was to ensure that the identity of the Australian company can be verified and an IRD number issued before any imputed dividends are paid to shareholders. Officials do not, therefore, support allowing the election to be made at any time in the imputation year in which a dividend may have been paid. Officials accept, however, that in the early years of the new legislation the requirement that elections are to be made 30 days before a dividend is paid may not be well known. Officials also accept that the consequence of otherwise valid elections being made less than 30 days before a dividend is paid would be that the Commissioner would have to disallow the imputation credits attached to dividends of the Australian company concerned. As this would cause substantial compliance and administration costs when there is neither a policy concern nor an avoidance risk, officials agree with the alternative submission made that the Commissioner be given a discretion to allow later elections for newly formed or newly eligible Australian companies. Given the newness of the legislation, however, officials are of the view that it would be prudent to also allow the Commissioner’s discretion to apply to Australian companies generally for the first two years of the rules rather than the first year, as proposed in the submission. In both situations, the discretion would apply only to elections that would have been valid had they been made on time. 169 Recommendation That the primary submission be declined but the alternative submission be accepted but extended to all taxpayers for the first two years of the operation of the legislation. Issue: Common ownership of a consolidated group Clause 22 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Common ownership should be based on ownership of the consolidated group, irrespective of individual companies entering or exiting the group. This is because the current legislation gives rise to unintended consequences such as shelf companies, with no credits, breaching the common ownership requirements. Comment Officials agree with this submission. The policy intent of this provision is that more than one consolidated group may form an imputation group only if all the imputation credits of the consolidated groups have the same continuity profile. The emphasis of this provision is meant to be on common ownership when the credits were earned rather than common ownership generally. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Recording of debits and credits by a resident imputation subgroup Clause 38 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) While the current wording of section ME 10(1D)(b) does not make it clear that entries other than entries from transactions should go to the resident imputation subgroup, the proposed amended provision is also unclear and does not clarify the position. It is proposed that for simplicity the original drafting be restored but the words “arise from transaction” be omitted. 170 Comment Officials agree that the drafting of the current provision could be made clearer. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Transfers of credits between imputation credit accounts and policyholder credit accounts Submission (14 – Russell McVeagh) • Consistent with the commentary, the legislation governing transfers from an individual policyholder credit account should allow transfers of credits between a company’s policyholder credit account and its imputation credit account regardless of whether the company is a member of an imputation group. • Where an election is made to transfer a credit from a company’s policyholder credit account to the imputation credit account of its imputation group, the transferred credits should be added to the group’s imputation credit account. The credit should arise on the date the company makes the election. • Similarly when an election is made to transfer a credit from a consolidated imputation group’s imputation credit account, the legislation should be amended to ensure a debit arises to the imputation credit account of the consolidated imputation group. Comment Officials agree with the submissions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, with application from 1 April 2003, the application date of the original amendments. 171 Issue: Australian imputation credit account companies Submission (14 – Russell McVeagh) Contrary to previous commentary on trans-Tasman imputation, it is arguable that the current legislation only allows companies that are also New Zealand residents to elect to have an imputation credit account. The legislation should be clarified. Comment The maintenance of an imputation credit account is mandatory for New Zealand resident companies unless they fall within one of the exceptions. One of the exceptions is if the company is a non-resident company. This exception appears to have been enacted to put beyond doubt that non-resident companies cannot maintain imputation credit accounts. The trans-Tasman legislation then used the non-resident company exclusion as a base for carving out Australian companies. It could be argued that the current legislation is in fact correct, as provided for in the exception; it targets Australian companies that are also not resident in New Zealand. Officials do, however, agree that Australian companies that were not also New Zealand resident companies were never entitled to maintain an imputation credit account as they were not resident in New Zealand. On balance, officials’ view is that for the avoidance of doubt this provision should be amended to make it clear that all Australian resident and Australia/New Zealand dual resident companies can elect to maintain an imputation credit account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted with application from 1 April 2003, the application date of the original amendments. Issue: Imputed dividends paid in a foreign currency Submission (14 – Russell McVeagh) The dividend withholding payment rules should be amended to adjust the amount of dividend withholding payment due when the foreign dividend and any foreign withholding taxes are converted to New Zealand dollars at an exchange rate that differs from the exchange rate used to attach imputation credits. Currently the inconsistent treatment of exchange rates means that full imputation credits may not fully cover a dividend withholding payment liability. 172 Comment The issue of exchange rates when a dividend is paid in Australian dollars and the imputation credits are attached in New Zealand dollars proved to be one of the more complex technical issues to resolve during the consultation phase before the trans- Tasman imputation legislation was introduced last year. The complexities involved are borne out by the extensive discussion of three possible options in the discussion document, Trans-Tasman Triangular Tax. In the end, and on balance, the government decided that to minimise compliance costs the best option was that New Zealand dollar imputation credits should be attached to Australian dollar dividends based on the exchange rate on the date of declaration. It was accepted that as there was no perfect solution, there would at times be winners and losers, and so the lowest compliance cost option was chosen. While officials agree with the point made by the submission, our view is that this is an outcome envisaged at the time the legislation was introduced, and to make the suggested amendments would unduly complicate the dividend withholding payment rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consequential drafting issues Clauses 40 and 64 Submission (Matters raised by officials) The legislation should be amended to allow transfers from a company’s dividend withholding payment account to its imputation group imputation credit account. Section ME 18(4)(b) should be amended to include a reference to the imputation credit account of an imputation group. Section NH 6(6)(a)(ii) should be amended to refer correctly to a “dividend withholding payment account”. Comment Currently, the legislation envisages only transfers from a company’s dividend withholding payment account to the company’s imputation credit account. To incorporate the imputation grouping rules in this area, officials recommend that an amendment be made. 173 Section ME 18(4), the provision governing the timing of debits in a company’s policyholder credit account, needs to be updated to take account of the recent imputation group amendments. Section NH 6(6), which enables the transfer of the credit balance in the dividend withholding payment account of a consolidated group, contains an incorrect reference to “dividend withholding account”. This reference should be replaced by “dividend withholding payment account”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 174 ALLOCATION DEFICIT DEBIT RULES FOR LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES Issue: General support for amendments Clauses 40, 42, 47-49, 51-52, 64 and 65 Submissions (5 – Promina Group New Zealand Ltd, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 7 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) Submissions support the introduction of new allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies subject to their specific submissions discussed in this report. We commend Inland Revenue officials for consulting with the industry and for including these provisions in the bill to resolve the inadequacies in the current legislation. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) ISI is pleased that the life insurer dividend withholding payment rules are being changed to remove the incongruous results that arose under the previous rules, and we support the amendments being made. (Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand) The policy underlying the proposal appears consistent with the general approach to both dividend withholding payments and the life insurance rules. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment The amendments in the bill have resulted from extensive consultation with members of the life insurance industry. The new rules are designed to prevent the distorted and unintended results that can arise under the current allocation deficit debit rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 175 Issue: Earliest DWP reference period Clause 49 Submission (5 – Promina Group New Zealand Ltd) The definition of “DWP reference period” in new section MG 8B(3) should be amended so that the DWP reference period will not commence earlier than 1 April 2004 unless a company has elected to apply section MG 8B retrospectively to an imputation year beginning after 31 March 1995 and before 1 April 2004. If such a retrospective election has been made, the DWP reference period should not commence earlier than the beginning of the imputation year in which the new rules have application. As currently drafted, the first DWP reference period arising in respect of a post- 1 April 2004 “dividend year” could potentially commence a number of years before the imputation year starting 1 April 2004. This is because the DWP reference period includes both the dividend year and also extends back to include all consecutive years in which no dividend has been paid with DWP credits attached. In cases where no prior dividends have been paid with DWP credits attached, this period could extend indefinitely. Obviously this is not an intended result. Comment Officials agree that the first DWP reference period should start no earlier than 1 April 2004 unless a taxpayer elects to apply the new rules from an earlier date, in which case the first DWP reference period should start from that earlier date. This is in line with the policy intention of the new rules as described in the commentary to the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify that section MG 8B(2) conditions are cumulative rather than disjunctive Clause 49 Submission (5 – Promina Group New Zealand Ltd, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section MG 8B(2) should be amended to clarify the intention of the legislation that an allocation deficit debit arising only where both paragraphs MG 8B(2)(a) and MG 8B(2)(b) are satisfied, that is, these are not alternative tests for determining whether an allocation deficit debit arises. 176 Comment Officials agree that it is the intention of the legislation that an allocation deficit debit should arise only where both paragraphs MG 8B(2)(a) and MG 8B(2)(b) are satisfied. Accordingly, the full colon between these paragraphs should be replaced by “; and”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date provisions Clauses 40, 42, 47-49, 51-52, 64 and 65 Submission (5 – Promina Group New Zealand Ltd, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The new allocation deficit debit rules for life insurance companies are intended to apply generally for the 2004-05 and subsequent imputation years. However, the application date provisions are contingent on the payment of a dividend. For example, clause 48(2) of the bill is currently drafted so that clause 48(1) (which repeals the existing sections MG 8(5) to (7) of the Income Tax Act 1994) applies only for dividends paid in the 2004-05 and subsequent years. However, the repeal of sections MG 8(5) to (7) should be effective from the start of the 2004-05 imputation year regardless of whether or not a dividend is paid in that or any subsequent imputation years. Similarly, the ability to elect in writing to retrospectively apply the new allocation deficit debit rules to an imputation year that begins after 31 March 1995 and before 1 April 2004 should also not be contingent on dividends being paid in an imputation year. Therefore, taxpayers should be allowed to elect to apply the new rules retrospectively even where they have not paid a dividend with dividend withholding payment credits attached in an imputation year that begins after 31 March 1995 and before 1 April 2004. The Promina Group submission also suggests a different drafting approach for the application date provisions. This approach involves removing the application date provisions from clause 49 and a number of other provisions making consequential amendments and instead providing that new section MG 8B should apply automatically to an imputation year in respect of which an election to apply clause 48(1) (which repeals section MG 8(5) to (7)) has been made. Comment Officials agree with the submission’s main point that there should be no requirement in the various application date provisions for a dividend to be paid. For example, the application date provision in clause 48(2) should simply provide that subsection (1) (repealing current section MG 8(5) to (7)) applies for the 2004-05 and subsequent 177 imputation years. The repeal of the existing allocation deficit debit rules in section MG 8(5) to (7) should not be dependent on whether or not a dividend is paid in a particular imputation year. Officials do not agree with the part of the Promina Group New Zealand Ltd submission that requested that the application date provisions should be structured in a different way. The suggested restructuring would not be consistent with the general approach to application date provisions in the bill. For example, it would result in clause 49, which inserts new section MG 8B (the new allocation deficit debit rules) into the Income Tax Act 1994, having no application date provision itself. Also, the subject matter of clause 48 should be limited to the repeal of section MG 8(5) to (7) and should not include (as suggested by the submission) the application date of new section MG 8B. Officials will also make a number of drafting improvements to the application date provisions. In particular, it would be an improvement if the election provisions for the new rules to apply retrospectively to imputation years beginning after 31 March 1995 and 1 April 2004 were located within the new section MG 8B itself instead of in the amendment Act. It should also be clarified that if a taxpayer makes an election to apply the new rules retrospectively to an imputation year beginning after 31 March 1995 and before 1 April 2004 then that election applies for subsequent imputation years as well. That is, it should not be possible to opt in and out of the new rules for imputation years beginning before 1 April 2004. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by removing the requirement for a dividend to be paid from the various application date provisions and that the application date provisions be modified as outlined above. Issue: Guidance on reduced deficit debit calculation Clause 49 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The reduced deficit debit calculation in new section MG 8B may not achieve its intended objective. Inland Revenue is requested to provide further guidance on its application with some worked examples. The submissioner was not able to verify the rationale for the result achieved under the reduced deficit debit calculation. 178 Comment The reduced deficit debit formula applies if the DWP account balance is less than the maximum deficit debit (before any allocation deficit debit arises). The application of the formula is favourable to taxpayers and is intended to ensure that inappropriate or disproportionate debits do not arise. It is intended that the application of the formula will ensure that the credit ratio is the same for both policyholders and shareholders. An example of the application of the reduced deficit debit formula is given in the commentary to the bill. Inland Revenue will monitor the application of the new allocation deficit debit rules and will consider any further submissions made on them. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: DWP reference period definition Clause 49 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The reference to “maximum” in the DWP reference period definition in new section MG 8B(3) has no reference point. It is therefore unclear what it is intended to achieve and what it does in fact achieve. Comment The new rules will apply only to an imputation year in which a dividend payment, with DWP credits attached, is made. For the purposes of the allocation deficit debit allocation, the relevant period of time to be considered will be from the end of that imputation year back to the start of the imputation year following the imputation year in which a shareholder dividend was last paid. This period is referred to in the legislation as the “DWP reference period”. The reference to “maximum” is intended to ensure that this period, regardless of the number of imputation years, is measured correctly. Officials consider that no change needs to be made to the legislation to clarify this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 179 Issue: DWP reference period definition Clause 49 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clarity should be added to the DWP reference period definition by stating a commencement for the period. The commencement of a DWP reference period is implicitly the beginning of the first imputation year in the period in which no dividend is paid. The current drafting, because it has no beginning reference point, begs that question. Comment Officials agree that the commencement of a DWP reference period is the beginning the first imputation year in the period in which no dividend is paid. Officials consider that the current drafting achieves that effect and that further clarification is not required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: DWP reference period definition Clause 49 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Compliance costs could be minimised by providing a rolling but limited starting point for the DWP reference period. The new rules compare allocation of DWP credits to policyholders and allocations of DWP credits to shareholders on dividend distributions. As currently drafted, the period over which the two allocations can be compared is potentially unlimited. This creates compliance costs (with respect to retention of records and knowledge) and uncertainty. Consideration should be given to limiting the period to, say, the seven-year period for retention of records. Comment Although limiting the DWP reference period to the seven-year period for retention of records could reduce compliance costs, it could also disadvantage taxpayers if they had policyholder net losses in years earlier than the seven-year period. This is because net losses reduce the amount of potential allocation deficit debit. Taxpayers may prefer to incur the compliance cost of keeping information for longer periods rather than incur larger allocation deficit debits. 180 Another reason for not supporting this submission is that the type of information used in the calculation would generally be included in a company’s ordinary financial statements, which are normally retained for longer periods that the seven-year period for retention of records for tax purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Policyholder DWP ratio definition Clause 49 Submission (7 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand, 27 – KPMG) The denominator used in the policyholder DWP ratio should be changed to: taxable income to the life insurer, less underwriting profit and dividends paid to shareholders. This would be adjusted to remove losses carried forward. The submission considers that this would give a better proxy for the income that is derived by the policyholders than the net policyholder income used in the formula in the bill. The formula in the bill is always going to give a result that is less than the shareholder DWP ratio when the policyholder base is in an overall loss for the DWP reference period. That is, when the policyholder base is in loss, there will always be streaming when dividends are paid to shareholders with DWP credits attached. Comment The policyholder DWP ratio definition in the bill is the result of extensive consultation with members of the life insurance industry. Officials consider that instead of making a fundamental change at this stage to the formula it is preferable to see how the current formula works in practice. Inland Revenue will be monitoring the application of the new allocation deficit debit rules and will consider any further submissions made on them. Officials also do not agree with the part of the submission that says that the policyholder DWP ratio definition will always give a result less than the shareholder DWP ratio (thereby indicating streaming) when the policyholder base is in an overall loss for the DWP reference period. This is because new section MG 8B(2)(a) provides that an allocation deficit debit will not arise in this situation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 181 Issue: Conduit tax relief companies Clause 49 Submission (7 – Investment Savings & Insurance Association of New Zealand) The allocation deficit debit rules should not apply to life insurers that are conduit tax relief companies. Comment New section MG 8B(1) already provides that the allocation deficit debit rules do not apply to conduit tax relief companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of reduced deficit debit formula Clause 49 Submission (27 – KPMG) The formula used for calculating the reduced allocation deficit debit should be used in all cases. It seems arbitrary that the debit in the DWP account should vary depending on the balance of that account. Comment The reduced deficit debit formula is used to calculate the allocation deficit debit if the DWP account balance is less than the maximum deficit debit (before any allocation deficit debit is imposed). The formula has been designed to ensure that inappropriate or disproportionate debits do not arise in this situation. The formula has not been designed to apply in all cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 182 Issue: Consequential amendments Clauses 49, 51, 52 and 64 Submission (Matters raised by officials) In new section MG 8B(3), in item c of the definition of “policyholder DWP ratio”, the reference to “dividend withholding payment credit account” should be replaced by “dividend withholding payment account”. In item c of the definition of “reduced deficit debit”, the reference to “imputation credit account” should be replaced by “dividend withholding payment account”. In section MG 15(1)(f), the reference to “section MG 8” should be replaced by “section MG 8(4)”. The replication of rules concerning the application of section MG 8 to consolidated groups that is contained in section MG 16A(1) and NH 6(3) and (4) should be removed. Comment Two terminology drafting errors in the formulas in new section MG 8B(3) should be corrected. A cross-referencing amendment, similar to that being made by clause 47(1) of the bill to section MG 5(1)(f), should also be included in clause 51 by amending section MG 15(1)(f). There is currently a replication of the rules concerning the application of section MG 8 (dealing with allocation rules for DWP credits) to consolidated groups. This replication is contained in sections MG 16A(1) and NH 6(3) and (4). This replication should be removed by repealing section NH 6(3) and (4) and replacing section MG 16A(1) with a provision that follows the approach used in the repealed section NH 6 provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 183 FUND WITHDRAWAL TAX Issue: Drafting suggestions – clause 7 Clause 7 Submission (27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 8 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) The words “amount withdrawn” should be used in the new formula in section CL 4(2) instead of using the word “withdrawn”. Unless the legislation intended to use the word “withdrawal” in the formula in section CL 4(2), instead of the word “withdrawn,” defining withdrawal is unnecessary and should be removed. If “amount withdrawn” is used in the formula, the issue goes away. (KPMG, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The formula in CL 4(2) refers to “withdrawal” and should be amended to refer to “withdrawn”. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CL 4(2)(a) should refer to “withdrawal” rather than “withdrawn”. (The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) Comment We agree that the wording in section CL 4(2) needs amendment. The proposed legislation intended to use the word “withdrawal” in the formula in section CL 4(2), instead of the word “withdrawn”. Recommendation That the submission that the formula in section CL 4(2) be amended to refer to “withdrawal” be accepted. Issue: The term “other contributions” should be clarified Clause 7 Submission (27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The definition of “other contributions” in the proposed section CL 4 (2) should be further clarified. It would assist if the definition of “other contributions” actually referred to Subpart NE. 184 Comment The definition of “other contributions” refers to an existing defined term “employer contributions to superannuation savings”. This definition is in section OB 1 and means: • employer superannuation contributions made on or after 1 April 2000 other than contributions which are subject to the 39% rate or treated as salary or wages; • any return on the contributions above; and • reserves, except those allocated to an account of the member’s contribution for smoothing of investment returns (this exception only applies if the superannuation fund has 10 or more unassociated members). “Other contributions”, therefore, is a residual sum which excludes “employer contributions to superannuation savings”. The amendment proposed in the submissions to define “other contributions” as part of the amount withdrawn that is not employer contributions subject to section NE 2(1) would mean that some employer contributions that are currently treated as other contributions and, therefore, not subject to the fund withdrawal tax, would become subject to fund withdrawal tax. The amendment proposed in the submissions would narrow the scope of the concept of “other contributions”, which is not the intent of the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting suggestions – clause 8 Clause 8 Submission (7 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 8 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) In section CL 8(2)(a)(ii) and section CL 8(2)(b)(ii) the words “its members” should be replaced with “the member”. This section may be interpreted as applying only in the situation where all members have been transferred from the predecessor fund, which is unnecessarily restrictive. It should be adjusted to allow for the situation where the member in question has transferred, but the superannuation fund has not been transferred in its entirety. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) In section CL 8(2)(a)(i) “the period that includes” should be deleted. The words “and ends when” should be replaced with “before”. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) 185 Comment We agree that the amendment should be clarified so that it applies in the situation where a member transfers rather than when a fund has transferred in its entirety. We have clarified with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand that the changes suggested to section CL 8(2)(a)(i) were intended to shorten or simplify the wording of the proposed amendment. We do not consider the suggested changes would have this effect. Recommendation That sections CL 8(2)(a)(ii) and CL 8(2)(b)(ii) be amended to make it clear that the legislation is not restricted to a situation where all members have transferred from the predecessor fund. That the submission in relation to section CL 8(2)(a)(i) be declined. Issue: Uncertainty on application of provision Clause 8 Submission (8 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) The wording of the proposed section CL 8(2) of the bill does not state that the exemption applies if either the conditions of section (a) apply or the conditions of (b) apply. The submitter has assumed that it is not necessary that both paragraphs (a) and (b) need to be satisfied for the exemption to apply. This change removes the need for trustees to obtain details of employer contributions made to a previous fund in situations where no funds have been transferred, and reduces compliance costs. Comment This assumption is correct and will be set out clearly in the Tax Information Bulletin that provides commentary on the enacted legislation. Paragraphs (a) and (b) are separate tests applying to different situations. Paragraph (a) relaxes the “two years or more” employment requirement in current section CL 8(2)(a), allowing for previous employment to be counted where the employer changes (such as part of business restructuring) or where the employee has made contributions throughout that period and his or her employer’s contributions have not been more than 150 percent of a previous year’s contributions. Paragraph (b) covers the situation where the employee meets the “two years or more” employment test but fails the contribution tests in either section CL 8(2)(b) or section CL 8(2)(c) because the employee has been in a scheme for less than three complete years before ceasing employment. The amendment in paragraph (b) therefore intends to allow for the contribution test to be relaxed for those whose membership to a 186 scheme is less than three years, provided they meet the employment test and the employer contributions paid on their behalf are considered normal employer contributions and there is no avoidance concern. It is standard drafting practice in New Zealand to distinguish between three possible situations in which consequences flow from the satisfaction of factors that are listed in paragraphs. If all the factors in the list must be satisfied to produce the consequence, the paragraphs are linked by “and”, if only one factor must be satisfied to produce the consequence, the paragraphs are linked by “or” and in any other situation the paragraphs are linked by colons. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Redefining “employer” Clause 8 Submission (27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand). Section CL 8 has given rise to interpretation issues since its inception. The use of the language in paragraph (iv) and (v) is only going to exacerbate things. The Commissioner’s ability to exercise discretion in a timely and appropriate manner is quite limited. It is also hard for taxpayers to know who in IRD to approach to get such a determination. The objective of the changes to section CL 8 could be better achieved by redefining the “employer” for the purposes of this section or by regarding cessation of employment in these circumstances as a valid commercial occurrence. While this poses a small risk that employers could deliberately structure their affairs in such a way as to thwart section CL 8, the Commissioner either has the option of applying the general anti-avoidance rules or just living with the risk on the basis that it is very small and unlikely to happen in practice. Comment The Commissioner’s discretion does not relate to the employment test but to the contribution test in section CL 8(2)(b). The proposed amendment recognises that contributions can be made by more than one employer. Furthermore, officials are recommending that a de minimis rule be introduced, together with the Commissioner’s guidelines, to assist trustees in determining whether the exception applies (see below). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 187 Issue: Increased compliance costs from exercise of Commissioner’s discretion Clause 8 Submission (27 – KPMG, 26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 7 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, 8 – the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) The application of the changes in the proposed section CL 8(2)(b) is expected to increase the compliance costs and increase uncertainty for trustees. (KPMG, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc, the Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) In order to take account of the range of possible contribution scales in a fund’s trust deed, the proposed section CL 8(2)(b)(iv) and section CL 8(2)(b)(v) give the Commissioner discretion to determine whether the amount contributed and subsequently withdrawn is consistent with the fund’s documentation, or otherwise should have been subject to withdrawal tax. The trustees of the fund will need to be satisfied of the above before making the payment under this section. New section CL 8(2)(b)(iv) is subjective and can be a contentious point. This lack of clarity introduces the possibility of trustees paying an amount without deducting fund withdrawal tax, then being subsequently challenged by the Commissioner and being subject to penalties and interest. Clear guidance should be provided by the Commissioner on the exercise of this discretion. That should include a de minimis level, recognising that most withdrawals will be small amounts reflecting the short period of fund membership, below which the trustees need not seek a decision from the Commissioner. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand Inc) The Commissioner should issue guidelines as to what payments will be exempt and any discretionary elements should be referred to the Government Actuary for his consideration, rather than the Commissioner. (The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) Comment We agree that the legislation should be amended to provide clarity for trustees concerning whether or not an amount is subject to a fund withdrawal tax deduction. Reference to the Commissioner’s discretion only relates to new section CL 8(2)(b). This was intended to prevent the abuse of the relaxed contribution tests provided by this amendment. Officials have been discussing with submitters the most appropriate way to provide certainty while dealing with avoidance concerns. 188 We agree that there is merit in the use of a de minimis. We suggest a de minimis of $5,000 applying to the amount of employer contributions withdrawn would be appropriate. We also suggest that the de minimis be annual to make it more robust for short serving members. We acknowledge that the Commissioner should provide guidance for those cases that do not fall within the de minimis. This will ensure that those who are not within the de minimis are able to take advantage of the relaxed contribution tests provided the contributions are considered “normal” employer contributions in the particular situation and there are no avoidance concerns. The guidance will set out the factors to be considered in determining whether the exemption applies. Recommendation That new section CL 8(2)(b) be redrafted to include an annual de minimis of $5,000 for employer contributions withdrawn. The Commissioner will issue guidance concerning the exercise of the discretion in section CL 8(2)(b)(iv) and (v) following appropriate consultation with interested parties. Issue: Overseas transfers Submission (8 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) On the current wording of the legislation the benefit of an employee who ceases employment in New Zealand by reason of transfer to an overseas company that is related in terms of CL 11 is subject to fund withdrawal tax. Transfers to overseas retirement benefit schemes that are operated by a related employer should be exempt from fund withdrawal tax. Comment Because the submission is outside the scope of the remedial matters included in the bill officials have not been able to consider it fully. Officials acknowledge the issue raised. However, any such exemption does give rise to avoidance concerns if the employer contribution made in New Zealand could be withdrawn without being subject to fund withdrawal tax, which will be the case if the member’s interests have been transferred to a foreign superannuation scheme. Officials propose that the issue be added to the tax policy work programme and addressed as resources permit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 189 Issue: Credits from reserves Submission (8 – The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) There are situations where fund withdrawal tax will apply if credits have been made to a member’s accounts from the fund’s reserve accounts which do not appear to follow the intention of the legislation. We believe that section CL 8(4) should be amended to allow credits from Reserve Accounts to be recognised as specified superannuation contributions. Comment The definition of “employer contributions to superannuation savings” includes reserves (paragraph c). However, officials note that the definition of “reserves” is restricted to contributions that were made after 1 April 2000, and the issue raised in the submission concerns credits from reserves that existed before 1 April 2000, which are therefore excluded from the definition. Because the submission is outside the scope of the remedial matters included in the bill, officials have not been able to consider it fully. Officials recommend that the issue be added to the tax policy work programme and addressed as resources permit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Defined benefit to defined contribution conversions Submission (8– The Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Inc) The rules do not contemplate the situation where a defined benefit fund converts to a defined contribution fund. This raises two issues, the treatment of the accrued benefit of the member at the time of the conversion, and the assessment of the extent of any increase in the rate of the employer’s contributions on behalf of the member. Provision should be made in the legislation to cover these situations. As the issues are complex and relatively infrequent it may be the case that these need to be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Government Actuary (or the Commissioner). Comment In some situations a conversion can occur within the existing trust framework or may constitute a transfer to a new fund (in which case it will not be a withdrawal). The issue raised in the submission is the determination of what level of employer subsidy in the defined contribution scheme is reasonable given the exchange of benefits that have occurred. The level could then be used as the baseline for determining whether the change constitutes an increase in the employer contributions. 190 Because the submission is outside the scope of the remedial matters included in the current bill officials have not been able to consider it fully. Officials recommend that the issue be added to the tax policy work programme and considered as resources permit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 191 DEFERRED DEDUCTION RULE Issue: Deferral of losses Clause 18 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendment needs to be changed to ensure that it applies only to net losses from a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC). Alternatively, the application of the deferred deduction rule should be amended to clarify that losses arising from an arrangement which arose prior to the 2004-2005 income year are excluded from the adjustment under the rule. Comment The intention is that the deferred deduction rule should apply to deductions incurred in the 2004-05 and subsequent income years. It should apply to some arrangements entered into before the start of the 2004-2005 year, but only to deductions incurred after the start of that year, not to losses carried forward from years prior to 2004-2005. Where allowable deductions exceed gross income for any taxpayer, a net loss results which can be carried forward to a future year by the taxpayer involved. The submission argues that references to the term “allowable deductions and losses” in section ES 3(2) could be interpreted to include a net loss carried forward from before the 2004-2005 income year. This interpretation is not consistent with the intention of the legislation and the matter should be addressed. Recommendation That references to “losses” in section ES 3(2) should be clarified or removed. Issue: Exclusion for foreign company shares held on capital account Clause 16 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exclusion for shares in a foreign company held on revenue account, should be extended to all foreign shares, irrespective of whether they are held on revenue or capital account. 192 Comment The exclusion for foreign shares held on revenue account was introduced because comprehensive tax rules surround such investments, and the deferred deduction rule should not impose further potential tax obligations. Further, losses from such a company cannot be utilised by a New Zealand shareholder. Other exclusions already exist for share investments, that is, where 70 percent of the total cost of the arrangement assets are from portfolio investments in a listed company, or shares that are part of an employee share scheme. Accepting the submission would have the potential to render the deferred deduction rule worthless. Further, the submission argues that, in the example provided, there is no requirement to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the target company. This is not the case. In the example, consolidation is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of deferred deduction rule too wide Clauses 16-18 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The application of the deferred deduction rule (even after the proposed amendments in the bill) is still too wide and has potential to capture commercial arrangements. Comment The deferred deduction rule has been carefully designed to provide objective tests for determining when the rule should apply and when it should not. Various submissions (in relation to the issues paper that was published initially, as well as at the 2003 bill introducing the rule, and since) have identified various arrangements that could be caught, and each has been carefully considered in relation to whether the rule should apply or not. This process will continue, and further changes will be made to the scope of the rule, as appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 193 Issue: Two drafting issues Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Two technical aspects of sections ES 2(3)(c) and ES 3(2) should be corrected and clarified. Comment Section ES 2(3)(c) This section currently states: “... has an effect, or has a purpose or effect of achieving an economic effect that is similar to the effect, of – ....” The submission suggests that this should be changed to: “... has a purpose or an effect of – ...”. Officials agree that this suggested change would result in an improvement in drafting style without changing the meaning of the law. Section ES 3(2) The submission states that this section has a paragraph (b), but no paragraph (a). This is not correct. Recommendation That the submission to amend section ES 2(3)(c) be accepted and the submission to amend section ES 3(2) be declined. Issue: Drafting issue Clause 17 Submission (19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The proposed section ES 2(3)(d) should be clarified, with the word “and” inserted between subparagraphs (A) and (B). 194 Comment The effect of the current provision is that, if parties are non-associated, and the loan is not arm’s length: • if the lender usually lends on arm’s length terms, and is resident in New Zealand, the loan will not be a limited recourse loan; • if the lender does not usually lend on arm’s length terms, and is resident in New Zealand, the loan will be a limited recourse loan; • if the lender usually lends on arm’s length terms, and is not resident in New Zealand, the loan will be a limited recourse loan; and • if the lender does not usually lend on arm’s length terms, and is not resident in New Zealand, the loan will be a limited recourse loan. This reflects the intended policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical issue Clause 17 Submission (19 Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Section ES 2(3)(d)(i) should be extended to cover banks and insurance companies that are tax-resident in “grey list” countries. Comment The “grey list” consists of Australia (excluding the Territory of Norfolk Island), Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Norway. Loans are excluded from the definition of “limited-recourse loan” where the terms are on an arm’s-length basis, and the lender regularly lends money on arm’s-length terms and is resident in New Zealand. This is on the basis that, where appropriate, enquiry can be made of the lender. In contrast, loans from some overseas lenders may be difficult to verify. Further, some overseas entities that call themselves banks may not, in fact, be banks. For example, the state of Delaware in the United States allows any company incorporated there to call itself a bank. 195 Accordingly, officials do not agree that the definition should be amended, at least at this stage. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the issue be kept under review. 196 WRITE-OFF – DATE OF MEASUREMENT OF NET LOSS Issue: Whether drafting achieves policy intent Clause 116 Submission (15 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submission supports the proposed amendment. However, it considers that the current drafting does not reflect the policy intent. In particular, the submission is concerned with the part of the amendment that refers to the “net loss of the taxpayer at the time at which the outstanding tax is written off”. This wording suggests that consideration of part year loss rules could be required, which would not seem to be the policy intent. Comment Officials consider that the policy intent of the amendment – which is to allow a taxpayer’s net loss to be measured as at the time the last return was filed – is achieved by the wording, which provides that when extinguishing a taxpayer’s net loss the Commissioner “may use a figure for that net loss based on the most recent return of income furnished by the taxpayer”. The wording referred to in the submission does not affect this measurement rule and is merely intended to assist in identifying whose net loss is being extinguished. Consideration of the part year loss rules will, therefore, not be required if the most recent return did not apply those rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 197 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Dividend withholding payments by local authorities Clause 63 Submission (2 – Deloitte and Dunedin City Council) While supporting the change, the submission suggests that consideration should be given to the clause being made retrospective from either 1 April 1988 (when the dividend withholding payment rules were originally introduced) or from the application date of the core provision amendments (1997-1998 and subsequent income years). Comment Under sections NH 1 and CB 10 of the Income Tax Act, local authorities have a liability to account for dividend withholding payments on dividends received from investments held directly in foreign companies. Tax has to be accounted for at 33%. They are unable to reclaim this tax. By virtue of section CB 3(b) local authorities are not liable to tax on any other investment income, although they do pay tax on income derived from their trading enterprises. They are unable to use the tax paid on foreign dividends against any other liabilities. In 2002 the legislation was amended to remove charities from the obligation to account for dividend withholding payment (charities then being in the same position as local authorities). This took effect retrospectively from 1997-98. Clause 63 puts local authorities in the same position as charities. The clause, as it is currently drafted, would apply to dividends received on or after the date of Royal assent. As the reason for amending the legislation is the same as the reason for amending it for charities in 2002, it would seem reasonable to make clause 63 retrospective from 1997-98, the application date of the core provision amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by making the clause apply to dividends received during 1997-1998 and subsequent years. 198 Issue: Redundant commencement date provision Clause 6 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 6(2) of the bill should be omitted. Comment The commencement date provision in clause 6(2) of the bill states that clause 6(1) (which removes a redundant reference to “assessable income”) comes into force on the date of Royal assent. This commencement date provision is redundant as it replicates the general commencement date provision in clause 2(1) of the bill, and should therefore be omitted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Timing of expenditure on leases of land and buildings Clause 65 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The amendment should not apply retrospectively to those taxpayers who have treated the relevant payments in accordance with the law prior to this amendment being made in a return filed or notice of proposed adjustment issued prior to the date the bill was first introduced to Parliament. Comment A drafting error at the time the finance lease rules were enacted in 1999 resulted in expenditure on leases of land and buildings being excluded inadvertently from the definition of “accrual expenditure” in section OB 1, which in turn means that such expenditure is not covered by the timing rule in section EF 1. An unintended consequence is that a taxpayer may claim an upfront deduction for the entire amount of a lease prepayment, instead of spreading the prepayment over the term of the lease as always intended. The bill proposes to fix this drafting error with effect from 20 May 1999. 199 Officials do not consider that taxpayers could be regarded as having a legitimate expectation that lease prepayments were not subject to the accrual expenditure timing rule in section EF 1. This timing rule has been a long-established feature of the income tax rules and, given the drafting error background, there was obviously never any public indication given by the government that this long-standing treatment would change. It was clearly never intended by Parliament that expenditure on leases of land and buildings would not be subject to the timing rule in section EF 1. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Matters that cannot be challenged Clause 103 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to section 103 in the commencement date provision in clause 2(13) should be omitted so that the commencement date for clause 103 is the date of Royal assent. Comment The commencement date for clause 103 (relating to certain decisions of the Commissioner under the GST Act that cannot be challenged) is currently stated to be 1 April 2005 by virtue of that clause being listed in clause 2(13) of the bill. It is intended that the commencement date for this provision be the date of Royal assent. Removing the reference to section 103 from clause 2(13) would mean that the general date of Royal assent commencement provision in clause 2(1) would apply to clause 103. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 200 Issue: Transitional provision for supplies of imported services Clause 140 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submission supports the proposed amendment. However, it considers that the amendment should go further to deal with services that are not physically performed. The amendment should not apply to contracts entered into before the enactment of the legislation. Taxpayers should be entitled to rely on the legislation as enacted when determining the results of their actions. If taxpayers have acted in reliance on the legislation as enacted rather than the Tax Information Bulletin item, they should be protected from the retrospective amendment proposed. Comment The submission assumes that new section 84B – containing the transitional provisions for supplies of imported services which will be made subject to GST at a future date – caters only for services that are physically performed and not for other types of services that are not physically performed, such as choses in action (for example, the supply of a trademark). This assumption is not correct. The transitional provision will apply to all services that are performed. The transitional provision is therefore applicable to services that are of a type that are not physically performed, such as rights under a chose in action. This view is supported by section 84(1A) – which is used for the purposes of the imported services transitional provision in section 84B, which refers to rights granted or exercisable under a statute, which clearly includes the supply of a chose in action such as a copyright right that would normally not be described as being “physically performed”. The submission also states that section 84B should contain provisions dealing with services that are not physically performed that are similar to the provisions used for the introduction of GST in 1986. Section 84B, by virtue of utilising the time of performance tests in subsections (1) to (1B) in section 84 (the transitional provision for the introduction of GST in 1986), already contains such provisions. Officials do not consider that the amendment made by this bill to section 84B of the GST Act has a retrospective effect. This is because the amendments concerning the supply of imported services have not yet come into force. Although the provisions were enacted on 25 November 2003, the amendments will come into force on 1 January 2005. This bill, containing the amendment to the transitional provision for supplies of imported services in section 84B, should be enacted before that date. 201 Also, as the submission acknowledges, the amendment being made by clause 140, which is to ensure that section 84B refers to the time of performance of the services, is consistent with the Tax Information Bulletin item published following the enactment of the imported services legislation on 25 November 2003. The submission that the amendment made by clause 140 should not apply to contracts entered into before the enactment of this bill could also disadvantage taxpayers in certain circumstances. This is because the amendment in this bill would allow imported services that are performed before the imported services legislation comes into force, but are treated as being made after that date by the ordinary time of supply rules, not to be subject to the reverse charge. However, in the absence of this amendment such services would be subject to the reverse charge. Therefore, agreeing to this aspect of the submission would result in some supplies of imported services being subject to the reverse charge when they would otherwise not be. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Determinations in relation to financial arrangements Clause 85 – 89 Submission (26 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submission supports the amendment, but seeks to allow the Commissioner discretion to allow the old determination to apply to a financial arrangement in cases where the requirement to change is materially disadvantageous to the taxpayer. Comment Sections 90(6), 90AC(6) and 90AE allow the Commissioner to “vary, rescind, restrict, or extend a determination” made under section 90(1) and section 90AC(1) by replacing the determination or by making a new determination. The determination does not have to be used for a financial arrangement which was entered into before the new determination was published until four years after the date of publication of the new determination. It has become apparent that if a determination has been issued, it cannot be withdrawn unless a replacement determination is issued. This was not intended by the original legislation, and a situation has arisen where a determination has been issued to an entity, has not been used, is not correct but cannot be withdrawn. 202 The submission questions whether it is fair for taxpayers to be forced to use new determinations on existing financial arrangements. The amendment is only seeking to give the Commissioner the power to rescind a determination without replacing it. The taxpayer can continue to use the determination for four years after the date that the determination is rescinded. This gives the taxpayer a long period of certainty. There is no justification for giving the Commissioner a discretion to allow the continued use of an old determination where this is advantageous to the taxpayer after the period of four years has expired. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 203 REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENTS Submission (10 – Business New Zealand) Officials should be asked to provide best quantitative estimates on the financial and economic impacts of the changes contained in the bill. Comment The submission expresses concern in relation to the analysis of compliance cost implications of proposed legislation contained in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements attached to bills. It comments that there is often very little quantitative analysis in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements (for example, the degree to which compliance costs are expected to change) and, equally, a lack of analysis of the wider economic impacts, thereby making it difficult for those making submissions to assess the financial and economic impact on compliance costs, either individually or in aggregate. It is often quite difficult to quantify the compliance impacts of proposed changes, as the impact can vary across the population according to factors such as taxpayer size and behaviour. While high-level estimates of compliance costs impacts are provided where possible, more often the impacts can only be qualitatively assessed. Inland Revenue is, however, in the process of improving its capacity to analyse the compliance cost implications of proposed changes to the tax system, to better comply with Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statement requirements. The department has commissioned research into the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized business, which should, among other things, allow the compliance impacts of proposed tax policy initiatives to be tested in an experimental way prior to implementation. An initial benchmarking survey of businesses’ tax compliance costs is expected to be underway in late 2004. It is also worth noting that the Generic Tax Policy Process ensures that proposed changes to the tax system are publicly consulted on at a very early stage, a feature acknowledged in the submission (that is, Inland Revenue being found to be one of the better agencies for consulting with the business community). This process allows affected parties the opportunity to raise concerns they may have in relation to the compliance cost impacts of proposed tax changes prior to legislation being introduced. Recommendation Note that officials are doing further work to improve the analysis of compliance cost impacts in Regulatory Impact and Business Compliance Cost Statements. 204 NUMBER OF REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Care when amending legislation Submission (10W – Business New Zealand) The government should take more care when amending the legislation to ensure that fewer subsequent remedial amendments are required. The large number of remedial changes in the bill calls into question the quality of the legislation and whether too many changes are pushed through the system too quickly. Hurried law is not good law. Comment Officials acknowledge the need for great care when amending legislation, to minimise the number of flaws and subsequently the number of remedial amendments. To this end, the government always endeavours to promote well-drafted legislation. However, tax legislation is very complex, and unfortunately some mistakes, and therefore remedial amendments, are inevitable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 205 Other amendments proposed by officials 206 207 INCOME FROM STANDARD-COST HOUSEHOLD SERVICES TREATED AS SCHEDULAR GROSS INCOME Submission (Matter raised by officials) Income from standard-cost household services should be removed from the definition of “schedular gross income”, and so be treated as ordinary income. Comment Rules providing for the tax treatment of standard-cost household services were enacted by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Income received from standard-cost household services was treated as schedular income. This income is treated separately from ordinary income. A taxpayer’s income tax liability is calculated for their schedular income, and separately for their ordinary income. These are then aggregated to get the taxpayer’s total income tax liability. Schedular income was used to ensure that income from standard-cost household services was matched with the standard costs attributed to that income. This prevented any excess standard costs from being used to minimise a taxpayer’s income tax liability on income from other sources. However, treating this income as schedular income has had two unintended consequences. First, because a taxpayer’s schedular income tax liability is calculated separately, they will have to fill out a separate tax return for their schedular income and their ordinary income. Given that the amendment was intended to reduce compliance costs, officials consider this to be of significant concern, and justifying remedial amendment. Secondly, as the two sources of income are not aggregated before applying the applicable tax rates, the threshold for moving to a higher marginal tax rate is raised. Income from one source, rather than total income, needs to be over $38,000 or $60,000 before a higher tax rate applies. A taxpayer is able to earn over a threshold but pay no more tax, if their income is split between schedular and other sources. This undermines the progressive structure of the income tax system and was not an intended result of the amendment. Officials consider remedial amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be made to remove standard-cost household services from the definition of “schedular gross income”. A further amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be made to continue to prevent excess standard costs from being used to minimise a taxpayer’s income tax liability on income from other sources. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 208 GST ON IMPORTED AND FINANCIAL SERVICES Issue: Zero-rating under the reverse charge Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 11A(1B) of the Act should be amended to more clearly reflect Parliament’s intent. The amendment should apply from the date section 11A(1B) comes into effect, on 1 January 2005. Comment Section 11A(1B) provides that the supply of imported services physically performed outside New Zealand or the arranging of services that are physically performed outside New Zealand will not be zero-rated if “the nature of the services is such that the services are physically received at – (a) The time and place at which the services are physically performed; and (b) No other time or place.” It is intended that the supply of imported services may be zero-rated if the services are physically performed outside New Zealand and the nature of the services is such that they can be physically received only at the time and place at which the services are physically performed. For example, accommodation can be physically received only at one time and place. The nature of certain intangible services, such as legal services, supplied offshore means that they could be physically received other than at the time and place at which they are physically performed. Therefore they should not be zero-rated. It is possible that the current legislation would allow services to be zero-rated if they are physically received offshore irrespective of any ability to receive the services at another time or place. For example, legal services supplied offshore could be zero- rated, although they are able to be received anywhere at any time. Section 11A(1B) should be amended to remove this possibility. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 209 Issue: Correction required to prevent GST double dipping Submission (Matter raised by officials) A deduction from output tax, calculated under section 20C of the GST Act, does not reflect its policy intent as it allows taxpayers to double dip in respect of claiming input tax credits. The amendment should apply from the date section 20C comes into effect, which is planned for 1 January 2005. Comment Sections 20(3)(h) and 20C were inserted into the GST Act by the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Section 20(3)(h) allows taxpayers a deduction from output tax in relation to exempt supplies of financial services to another financial service provider. This section was in response to concerns that continuing to exempt supplies of financial services between financial service providers under the newly enacted zero-rating rules would not address the policy concerns that formed the basis of the reforms, that is, to remove tax cascades, or over-taxation, of financial supplies consumed by businesses. The value of the deduction is calculated according to a formula, which is contained in section 20C. 4 The formula provides a proportional deduction from output tax and is in addition to that which can be recovered as a deduction from output tax using the principal purpose test or by way of a change in use adjustment. The proportion is found by multiplying two fractions. The first fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by you that consists of exempt supplies of financial services to a recipient financial services provider (the direct supplier). The second fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier that consists of taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies of financial services). 4 The formula is as follows: e d c b a×× Where: a is total GST that would be recoverable by you under section 20(3), other than under section 20(3)(h), in respect of the taxable period if all financial services supplied by the financial service provider were taxable supplies: b is the total value of exempt supplies of financial services made by you to the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period: c is the total value of supplies made by you in respect of the taxable period: d is the total value of taxable supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D: e is the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D. 210 The formula is limited to the activities of the direct supplier. Further supplies of financial services – for example, by the direct supplier to a third or subsequent financial services provider – are not included in the formula. A problem arises as the formula assumes that in respect of determining the value of item “a”, the taxpayer is unable to deduct input tax at all. This is not always the case. If a taxpayer can claim back GST paid on the purchase of goods and services on the basis of the principal purpose test and the other specific deductions allowed under 20(3), the application of “a” in the formula will allow taxpayers to effectively double dip, once in respect of the initial deduction under, for example, the principal purpose test, and again under the formula. This is inconsistent with the policy intent. Item “a” in the formula should be redrafted to ensure that where a taxpayer has deducted input tax under section 20(3) that a further deduction is not allowed under the formula. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 211 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGES Issue: Grammatical correction Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “resident” in section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act) should be amended to correct a grammatical error. Comment The definition of “resident” in section 2(1) of the Act currently reads: “Resident” means resident as determined in accordance with sections OE 1 and OE 2(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994: Provided that, notwithstanding anything in that section, – ...” The definition should be amended so that it reads: ““Resident” means .... Provided that, notwithstanding anything in those sections, – ...” Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Consequential effects of Income Tax Act 2004 on amendments to other Acts Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Income Tax Act 2004 contains concepts and terminology that differ from the concepts and terminology in the Income Tax Act 1994. Amendments to other statutes that currently refer to the Income Tax Act 1994 must take into account the differences in the Income Tax Act 2004. It is proposed that several amendments made by this bill, in particular amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994, be made in two forms. One form uses the concepts and terminology of the Income Tax Act 1994 and applies before the end of the 2004-05 income year. The other form uses the concepts and terminology of the Income Tax Act 2004 and applies from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year. 212 Comment These minor remedial amendments are necessary to ensure that the Income Tax Act 2004 is able to function as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Numbering and other errors and omissions in Income Tax Act 2004 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Some numbering and other errors and omissions have been identified in the Income Tax Act 2004.

In the bill as introduced, items in a list could be separated in 3 ways — by a colon, by “; or”, or by “; and”, depending on the relationship between the items. The decision was to change all colons to “; and” or “; or”. Subsequent analysis has determined that this change in punctuation style has resulted in material changes in the intended effect of a number of sections. Accordingly, officials propose to revert to the use of colons in provisions that apply whether 1 or more than 1 of the paragraphs or subparagraphs in a list are satisfied. In provisions that do not apply unless all of the items in a list are satisfied, “; and” is retained. In provisions that apply if 1, but not more than 1, of the items in a list is satisfied, “; or” is retained. The use of colons in such a way is consistent with the practice of the 215 Parliamentary Counsel Office as well as earlier Inland Revenue drafting style in provisions drafted for inclusion in both the Income Tax and other Inland Revenue Acts. Some 600 sections are affected. Comment These minor remedial amendments are necessary to ensure that the Income Tax Act 2004 is able to function as intended.

Included in Schedule 22 are numerous amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Part C of Schedule 23 to the Income Tax Act 2004 lists sections in the Income Tax Act 1994 that correspond to the new sections in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Twenty of the new sections are numbered in a manner that is inconsistent with the numbering style used for inserted sections. While inappropriately numbered, the new sections are, however, in their correct sequence in the Tax Administration Act. To remedy the situation, officials propose to amend Schedule 22 and make consequential amendments to the third column of Part A of Schedule 23 and the first column of Part C of Schedule 23. Some consequential changes to provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004 are also proposed. The changes are summarised by the amendments to the first column of Part C of Schedule 23, which are: (a) “14A” is replaced by “14B”: (b) “14B” is replaced by “14C”: (c) “91(1A)” is replaced by “91(1B)”: (d) “91AAA” is replaced by “91AAC”: (e) “91AB” is replaced by “91AAD”: (f) “91AC” is replaced by “91AAE”: (g) “91AD” is replaced by “91AAF”: (h) “91AE” is replaced by “91AAG”: (i) “91AF” is replaced by “91AAH”: (j) “91AG” is replaced by “91AAI”: (k) “91AH” is replaced by “91AAJ”: 216 (l) “91AI” is replaced by “91AAK”: (m) “91AJ” is replaced by “91AAL”: (n) “91AK” is replaced by “91AAM”: (o) “108(3A)” is replaced by “108(3B)”: (p) “113A” is replaced by “113B”: (q) “113B” is replaced by “113C”.

1 Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach”. This determination cancels and replaces Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What is a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? A forward contract for foreign exchange or commodities is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of foreign currency or commodities at some future date at a specified contract rate. For example, a forward contract for foreign currency is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of a currency at a future date at a price fixed (in terms of another currency) at the time the contract is entered into. Each party contracts simultaneously to sell one currency and purchase another currency. The same forward contract can always be viewed as either the sale of one currency or the purchase of the other currency. For example, a person who sells NZD forward against purchase of USD can view the contract as either— • the forward sale of NZD, or • the forward purchase of USD. A forward contract has characteristics that are very similar to a swap contract. In fact, swaps are often structured as a series of forward contracts. If you are a party to a swap, however, you may not apply this determination as swaps are subject to Determination G27. The only exception is a swap contract for fixed amounts, to be exchanged at a single fixed date. This type of swap is, in substance, a forward contract. Therefore, if you are a party to this type of forward contract, you have to apply this determination instead of Determination G27. When do you use this determination? You must use this determination for the 2003–04 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you are not a member of a group of companies and on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting 2 period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for the 2004–05 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you entered the forward contract after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2003–04 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach or Determination G14A; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you entered the forward contract after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2004–05 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach or Determination G14A; • you entered the forward contract before the date of this determination and you have made a return of your income or expenditure for an earlier income year and the forward contract on the basis of Determination G14A and are required under section 90 or sections 90AC and 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make a return for the income year and the financial arrangement under this determination; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and 3 (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You may not use this determination for an income year unless you are required to do so by the above paragraphs. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure under a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a forward contract. This expected value approach can only be used for forward contracts within the scope of this determination, which is narrower than Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities. If you are required to use this determination, you must not use Determination G14 for any such forward contract, and you must not use Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars for any financial arrangement within the scope of Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. Mark to Spot Approach You may use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract within the scope of this determination if you are not required to use this determination or Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act or the market valuation method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 36 of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(6) of the Act or by section EH 38(2) of the Act. 4 How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a forward contract is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. A typical forward contract drawn at the forward rate for no consideration, however, has no expected component. To apply this method to a forward contract for the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must— • ignore any offsetting of payments between the parties, so that every amount that would be payable under the forward contract is taken into account under this determination; and • choose one of the currencies under the forward contract as a base currency; and • determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the forward contract when you become a party to the contract, which consist of— (a) the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the contract; (b) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; (c) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate; and • convert the expected base currency payments, where the base currency is not NZD, into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates available at the time you become a party to the forward contract; and • spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the forward contract. To apply this method for the first time to a forward contract for an income year after the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must calculate the gross income or expenditure of the forward contract as set out above, except that you must— • in determining the expected component of the gross income or expenditure, use actual NZD payments up to the income year for which you first use this determination for the forward contract and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the forward contract; and • in calculating the expected NZD payments, use the relevant forward rates as at the end of the income year for which you first use this determination for the forward contract. You must perform the base price adjustment under whichever is appropriate of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 47 of the Act when a forward contract you are a party to matures or is disposed of. This adjustment contains the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure of the forward contract. You must also calculate a transition allowance for a financial arrangement to which you apply the method for the first time for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement. 5 How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? Election for 2003–04 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the day that is the end of your accounting period for the 2003–04 income year.

The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? The transitional adjustment must be made for the first income year for which you are required to use this determination for a forward contract if you entered the forward contract before the income year and you have not been required to apply Determination G14A for the forward contract. The calculation is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. The transitional adjustment requires that for the income year of the adjustment you treat as gross income or expenditure the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as described in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the forward contract matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment in whichever of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 47 of the Act is applicable to the forward contract. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(c) and section 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 7 3. Scope (1) This determination applies to the calculation of gross income or expenditure from a forward contract for foreign exchange and commodities. (2) This determination does not apply to— (a) a futures contract; (b) a security arrangement; (c) a forward contract for foreign exchange and commodities where the forward rates of the currency cannot be determined; (d) any forward contracts covered by the following determinations: Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts; Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable; Determination G27: Swaps; Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and Method for Spreading Income and Expenditure; except as specifically allowed by those determinations. (3) You must use this determination for an income year for a forward contract that satisfies subparagraphs (1) and (2) above if— (a) the income year is the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies and the members of the group make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (b) the income year is after the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies and the members of the group make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (iii) you entered the forward contract after the date of this determination and have been required to use this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A for an earlier income year; (iv) you entered the financial arrangement before the date of this determination and have used Determination G14A for an earlier income year and the financial arrangement and are not excluded from the application of this determination for the income year and the financial arrangement by section 90(6) or 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 8 (4) An election to use this determination must— (a) be made in writing to the Commissioner; and (b) include an election to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; and (c) if you are not a member of a group of companies, be made— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 and for subsequent income years; and (d) if you are a member of a group of companies, be made by all the members of the group and— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 income year and for subsequent income years. (5) If you must use this determination, you may not use— (a) Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within subparagraphs (1) and (2) above; (b) Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement that is within the scope of Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. (Note: A determination to which Determination G14B refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 9 4. Principle (1) If you are a party to a forward contract to which this determination applies, the gross income or expenditure in respect of the forward contract is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2) The gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is the total of an expected component and the unexpected component. (3) If you must apply this determination to a forward contract for the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must measure the expected component as at the time you enter the forward contract. (4) To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates as at the time you become a party to the forward contract and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the contract. (5) If you must apply this determination for the first time to a forward contract for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the forward contract, and you have not applied Determination G14A for the forward contract, you must measure the expected component as at the end of the income year. You must follow the principle set out above by calculating the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD payments up to the end of the income year in which you first apply the determination and the forward rates as at the end of that income year. (6) You must recognise the unexpected component for a forward contract by performing the base price adjustment that is required under whichever is applicable of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 45 of the Act. Transitional adjustment (7) For the first income year for which you must use this determination, you must perform the transitional adjustment calculation to calculate gross income or expenditure for all forward contracts— (a) that you entered before the income year; and (b) for which you have not been required to use Determination G14A. (8) This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you first use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in subparagraph (4), were known and this determination had been used since you became a party to the forward contract. 10 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) In this determination— base currency in relation to a person and a forward contract, means the currency under the forward contract which is adopted by the person as a reference currency for the purposes of this determination commencement date of a forward contract means the date on which the contract was entered into, or the date on which it was acquired, if later contract rate in relation to a forward contract means the price of one currency expressed in terms of the other currency under the forward contract covered interest parity means the proposition that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 period ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by 1 plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by 1 plus the domestic interest rate, i d . Forward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as— (1 + i f ) n Fwd t,n = S t × (1 + i d ) n currency includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement exchange rate means the price of 1 currency expressed in another currency forward rate means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case where the base currency is a commodity, the forward rate is the future value of the commodity (in NZD) future value in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially- acceptable, market-based method of valuation NZD means the currency of New Zealand non-base currency means the currency under a forward contract that is not the base currency spot contract means a contract for the sale or purchase of a currency for delivery in 2 business days 11 spot rate means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity spot value in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation USD means the currency of the United States of America. (3) All other terms used have the meaning given to them for the purpose of the Act. 6. Method (1) Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a forward contract under this determination is the total of— (a) the expected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (2) to (8); and (b) the unexpected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (9). (2) To calculate the income or expenditure in relation to a forward contract, you must first nominate a base currency. (3) If the terms of the forward contract provide for the netting off or offsetting of any amounts payable to or by one party to the forward contract with any amounts payable to or by the other party to the forward contract, you must ignore such netting off or offsetting for the purpose of this determination. (4) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a forward contract is the income year in which you become a party to the forward contract, you must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the forward contract as at the time you become a party to the forward contract. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the forward contract. The base currency payments of a forward contract consist of— (a) the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the forward contract; (b) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; (c) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate. (5) You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates as at the time you become a party to the forward contract if the base currency is not NZD. 12 (6) The expected NZD net amount is the difference between items (b) and (c) in subparagraph (4), adjusted for any amount as described in item (a). You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (7) You must use the straight-line method to spread the expected NZD net amount of a forward contract that has been written for no consideration at a rate other than the forward rate. (8) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a forward contract is after the income year in which you entered the forward contract, and you have not been required to use Determination G14A for the forward contract, you must follow the method set out in subparagraphs (1) to (7) to calculate gross income or expenditure of the forward contract, except that— (a) the NZD net amount to be spread under subparagraph (6) consists of— (i) actual NZD payments that have occurred since you became a party to the forward contract until the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination; (ii) expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract; and (b) the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination for the forward contract. (9) The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under subparagraph (5). You need not calculate the unexpected component separately as it is part of the base price adjustment required under whichever is applicable of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 45 of the Act. Transitional adjustment for existing forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities (10) You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation for the first income year for which you must use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract, if you entered the forward contract before the income year and have not been required to use Determination G14A for the forward contract. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for such forward contract in accordance with the following formula: a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the forward contract 13 b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the forward contract c is the sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the first income year for which you must use this determination. 7. Examples (1) A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. (2) At the time the New Zealand corporate becomes a party to the forward contract, the expected NZD net amount is zero and so the expected component of the gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is zero. The New Zealand corporate will recognise the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure from the forward contract when performing the base price adjustment under section EH 47 of the Act. Further examples are provided in the schedule. Signed on the 3 rd day of June 2004. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy 14 Schedule: Further examples Note: In each example involving a base price adjustment, the base price adjustment is calculated on the assumption that the forward contract is subject to Division 2 of Part EH of the Act. The details of the calculation would differ for a forward contract that was subject to Division 1 of Part EH of the Act. For the purpose of examples A to C assume that the spot rates and the forward rates for USD/NZD on the relevant dates are as follows: Date Actual Spot CIP: Fwd (0,t) CIP: Fwd (1,t) CIP: Fwd (2,t) Expected US,I Expected NZ,I 30-Apr-04 0.6350 0.6350 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-05 0.6149 0.6230 0.6149 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-06 0.5750 0.6113 0.6033 0.5750 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-07 0.5570 0.5997 0.5919 0.5642 0.04 0.06 The forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP) using the expected interest rates in the United States of America (US,I) and the expected domestic interest rates (NZ,I). Fwd (0,t) represents the forward rates at 30 April 2004 out to period t, while Fwd (1,t) and Fwd (2,t) represent the forward rates at 30 April 2005 and 30 April 2006, respectively, out to period t. For convenience in these examples when calculating the base price adjustment, the same buy/sell spot rates have been used at date of delivery. In practice this would not normally be the case. Example A: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 The expected base currency payments in relation to the forward contract consist of— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,689,475. Since the forward contract was entered into at the forward rate for no consideration, the expected NZD net amount is nil. So there is no expected component to be spread under the accrual rules. 15 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,689,475 = 1,795,332 − 1,689,475 = NZD $105,857 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $105,857 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $105,857 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example B: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 3 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2004 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. Assume that the New Zealand corporate has not been using Determination G14A and has been using an alternative method to calculate the income or expenditure of the forward contract in the 2003–04 income year. In fact, the corporate has recognised NZD $32,982 as gross income in respect of the forward contract for the year ending 30 June 2004. However, the corporate has elected to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years. Further, assume that the forward rate on 30 June 2005 out to 30 April 2007, the delivery date of the forward contract, is 0.5919. Therefore, the market rate for the delivery of USD $1,000,000 on 30 April 2007 is NZD $1,689,475. Given the contract rate of 0.5997 for the delivery of USD $1,000,000, there is an expected NZD net amount of NZD $22,059. Using this determination, the expected NZD net amount should be spread on a straight line basis over the term of the forward contract. 16 The transitional adjustment in the 2004–05 income year – 30 June 2005 Using a straight line method to spread the expected NZD net amount of NZD $22,059, the gross income in relation to the forward contract for the year ending 2004 and 2005 should have been NZD $1,226 and NZD $7,353, respectively. Therefore the transitional adjustment is— a – b – c + d where— a the sum of all amounts that would have been income from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 1,226 + 7,353 = 8,579 b the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 0 c the sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year = 32,982 d the sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year =0. The net amount of −NZD $24,403 is gross expenditure in the 2004–05 income year. At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 = 1,795,332 − 1,667,416 = NZD $127,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 32,982 + 7,353 = NZD $40,335 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = NZD $24,403 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 17 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $127,916 − $40,335 + $24,403 + 0 = $111,984 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,984 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example C: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate borrower paid NZD $10,000 to enter into this forward contract. (This could be the same forward contract as in the previous example where the forward contract was sold on 30 April 2005.) The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 The forward rate in this case is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, which is different from the contract rate of 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD. The expected settlement on the commitment to purchase USD $1,000,000 at 30 April 2007 is, therefore, NZD $1,689,475. The payment made in acquiring the forward contract was NZD $10,000. Thus, the expected base currency payments in this example consist of— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416. So, the expected NZD net amount from the forward contract is NZD $12,059 (i.e. the difference between the commitments under the forward contract measured at the contract rate (NZD $1,667,416) and the commitments under the forward contract measured at the forward rate (NZD $1,689,475) less the payment made to acquire the forward contract). The payments in relation to the forward contract are summarised in the table below. The expected NZD net amount is spread using the yield to maturity method recommended in Determination G3 and allocated to the income year on a daily basis consistent with Determination G1A. 18 Date Expected Cash (NZD) Contract Cash (NZD) Expected Cash (NZD) Expected Income 30-Apr-05 00−10,000 30-Apr-06 0004,852 30-Apr-07 1,689,4751,667,41622,059 7,207 Total 12,05912,059 YTM 49% At the first balance date – 30 June 2005 Expected component = (61/365 × $4,852) = $811. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $811 is gross income at the first balance date. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 Expected component = (61/365 × $7,207) + (304/365 × $4,852) = $1,204 + $4,041 = $5,245. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,245 is gross income at the second balance date. At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 – 10,000 = 1,795,332 − 1,677,416 = NZD $117,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 811 + 5,245 = NZD $6,056 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $117,916 − $6,056 + 0 + 0 = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. 19 Example D: Purchaser of base currency (USD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate Assuming that in the previous example, the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for the forward contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 Since the base currency is USD, the base currency payments expected at the commencement date is— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000 × 0.6149 = USD $6,149; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,667,416 × 0.5919 = USD $986,944; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416 × 0.5997 = USD $1,000,000. The expected base currency payments (summarised in column 4 of the table below) are converted into NZD using the relevant forward rates. The expected NZD net amount of NZD $12,057 is then spread over the term of the forward contract using the yield to maturity method recommended in Determination G3 and allocated to the income year on a daily basis consistent with Determination G1A.

Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $811 is gross income at the first balance date. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 Expected component = (61/365 × $7,206) + (304/365 × $4,852) = $1,204 + $4,041 = $5,245. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,245 is gross income at the second balance date. 20 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 − 10,000 = 1,795,332 − 1,677,416 = NZD $117,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 811 + 5,245 = NZD $6,056 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $117,916 − $6,056 = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example E: Forward contract to purchase commodity for USD at non-market rate with a corresponding forward contract in foreign exchange in market rate For the purpose of this example, assume that the forward rates for USD/NZD are as summarised in the following table. These forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP). Fwd (0,t) represents the forward rates at 30 June 2004 out to period t while Fwd (1,t) and Fwd (2,t) represent the forward rates at 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2006, respectively, out to period t. Date Actual Spot CIP: Fwd (0,t) CIP: Fwd (1,t) CIP: Fwd (2,t) Expected US,I Expected NZ,I 30-Jun-04 0.6350 0.6350 0.04 0.06 30-Jun-05 0.6149 0.6230 0.6149 0.04 0.06 30-Jun-06 0.5750 0.6113 0.6033 0.5750 0.04 0.06 30-Jun-07 0.5570 0.5997 0.5919 0.5642 0.04 0.06 The spot and forward rates per barrel of crude oil (in USD) are summarised in the following table. For example, the market price for a barrel of crude oil was USD $19.2 per barrel on 30 June 2004 while the forward price out to 30 June 2007 was USD $21 per barrel. 21 Date Actual Spot Fwd (0,t) Fwd (1,t) Fwd (2,t) 30-Jun-04 19.2 19.2000 30-Jun-05 19.6 20.2000 19.6000 30-Jun-06 21.1 21.8000 22.1000 21.1000 30-Jun-07 22 21.0000 22.8000 22.1000 A New Zealand company enters into 2 forward contracts simultaneously on 30 June 2004. The first forward contract secures the supply of 10,000 barrels of crude oil. This forward contract is to be cash settled on 30 June 2007, at USD $20 per barrel. The second forward contract was entered into for the purchase of USD $200,000 in exchange for the delivery of NZD at a contract rate of 0.5997. The second forward contract is to be settled on 30 June 2007. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for both contracts. At the time the forward contracts were entered into – 30 June 2004 The forward contract for the supply of crude oil was entered into at a price below the market rate. (This may be because the supplier is expecting excess supplies that have not been factored into the market prices yet.) The contract rate of $20 is lower than the forward rate of $21. As a result, gains are expected from the forward contract. The expected base currency payments include— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = 10,000 × $21 = USD $210,000; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = 10,000 × $20 = USD $200,000. The expected base currency payments are converted at the forward rate of 0.5997 USD/NZD and the expected NZD net amount is spread under the accrual rules over the term of the forward contract. As the company did not pay anything to enter into the forward contract, the gains cannot be spread using the yield to maturity method. Therefore, the straight-line method will be adopted to spread the expected gains. The forward contract for the foreign exchange was entered into at the forward rate. As such, there are no expected gains or losses to be spread under the accrual rules (see Example A). At the first and second balance date – 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2006 For the forward contract for crude oil— Expected component = 1/3 ($10,000/0.5997) = $5,558. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,558 is gross income at the first and second balance date. 22 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 On the 30 June 2007 balance date, the forward contract for the supply of crude oil would have been cash settled at the contract price of USD $20 per barrel. The market price per barrel of crude oil on the delivery date is USD $22. The spot exchange rate on the delivery date is 0.557 USD/NZD. The base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act in relation to the forward contract for the supply of crude oil is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 220,000/0.557 − 200,000/0.557 = 394,973 − 359,066 = NZD $35,807 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 5,558 + 5,558 = NZD $11,116 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $35,807 − $11,116 = $24,791 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2007 income year. The forward contract for the foreign exchange is also settled on 30 June 2007. In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 200,000/0.557 − 200,000/0.5997 = 359,066 − 333,500 = NZD $25,566 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 23 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $25,566 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2007 income year.
1 Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach”. This determination cancels and replaces Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When do you use this determination? This determination applies to financial arrangements where the rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD, including variable rate financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than NZD. However, this determination only applies to financial arrangements where the payment dates are known not later than your first balance date after you become a party to the financial arrangement, and forward rates for the currency in which the financial arrangements are denominated can be determined. You must use this determination for the 2003–04 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 2 You must use this determination for the 2004–05 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2003–04 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2004–05 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you entered the financial arrangement before the date of this determination and you have made a return of your income or expenditure for an earlier income year and the financial arrangement on the basis of Determination G9B and are required under section 90 or sections 90AC and 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make a return for the income year and the financial arrangement under this determination; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 3 You may not use this determination for an income year unless you are required to do so by the above paragraphs. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement that comes within the scope of this determination? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where any rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base currency other than NZD. This base currency might be a foreign currency or a commodity. This expected value approach can only be used for financial arrangements within the scope of this determination, which is narrower than Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. If you are required to use this determination, you must not use Determination G9A for any such financial arrangement, and you must not use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities for any forward contract within the scope of Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Mark to Spot Approach You can use Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement within the scope of this determination if you are not required to use this determination or Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act or the market valuation method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 36 of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(6) of the Act or by section EH 38(2) of the Act. How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where the rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base currency other than NZD is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. To apply this method to a financial arrangement for the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must— • determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the financial arrangement when you become a party to the financial arrangement; and 4 • use the initial interest rate to calculate the base currency payments under a variable rate financial arrangement denominated in a base currency other than NZD, and assume that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement; and • translate the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of the forward rates available at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement; and • spread the expected NZD net amount under the yield to maturity method and allocate it to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement on a daily basis; and • measure the unexpected component at the end of each balance date as the difference between actual and expected NZD payments. To apply this method for the first time to a financial arrangement for an income year after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must calculate the gross income or expenditure of the financial arrangement as set out above, except that you must— • in determining the expected component of the gross income or expenditure, use actual NZD payments up to the income year for which you first use this determination for the financial arrangement and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement; and • in calculating the expected NZD payments, use the relevant forward rates as at the end of the income year for which you first use this determination for the financial arrangement. You must also calculate a transition allowance for a financial arrangement to which you apply the method for the first time for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement. How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? Election for 2003–04 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the day that is the end of your accounting period for the 2003–04 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period for the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— 5 • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Election for 2004–05 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the 2004–05 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Election for income years beginning after 2004–05 income year If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 6 How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? A transitional adjustment must be made for the first income year for which you are required to use this determination for a forward contract if you entered the forward contract before the income year and you have not been required to apply Determination G9B for the forward contract. The calculation is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. The transitional adjustment requires that for the income year of the adjustment you treat as gross income or expenditure the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as described in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the financial arrangement matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure using the base price adjustment in whichever of section EH 4 and section EH 47 of the Act is applicable to the financial arrangement. Miscellaneous issues This determination requires that where a financial arrangement involves or is expressed in more than one currency or commodity, each separate currency or commodity tranche is to be treated as a separate financial arrangement. Where a facility provides for the rollover of a financial arrangement, the financial arrangement matures when the rollover occurs. Section EH 4 or section EH 47 of the Act applies in the income year the rollover occurs. Any payment arising from the rollover of a financial arrangement will be taken into account under section EH 4 or section EH 47 of the Act unless the payment is related to a separate financial arrangement. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(c) and 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope (1) This determination applies to the calculation of gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement, to the extent that any right or obligation under the financial arrangement is fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD and is not fixed in NZD. The payment dates under the financial arrangement must be known not later than your first balance date after you become a party to the financial arrangement. 7 (2) This determination does not apply to— (a) a futures contract; (b) a security arrangement; (c) a financial arrangement denominated in a currency where the forward rates of the currency cannot be determined; (d) any financial arrangements covered by the following determinations: Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities; Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts; Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable; Determination G27: Swaps; Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and Method for Spreading Income and Expenditure; except as specifically allowed by those determinations. (3) You must use this determination for an income year for a financial arrangement that satisfies subparagraphs (1) and (2) above if— (a) the income year is the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies that makes an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (b) the income year is after the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies that makes an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (iii) you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and have been required to use this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A for an earlier income year; (iv) you entered the financial arrangement before the date of this determination and have used Determination G9B for an earlier income year and the financial arrangement and are not excluded from the application of this determination for the income year and the financial arrangement by section 90(6) or 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 8 (4) An election to use this determination must— (a) be made in writing to the Commissioner; and (b) include an election to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; and (c) if you are not a member of a group of companies, be made— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 income year and for subsequent income years; and (d) if you are a member of a group of companies, be made by all the members of the group and— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 income year and for subsequent income years. (5) If you must use this determination, you may not use— (a) Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement that is within subparagraphs (1) and (2) above; (b) Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within the scope of Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. (Note: A determination to which Determination G9C refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 9 4. Principle (1) If you are a party to a financial arrangement to which this determination applies, the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2) The gross income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. (3) If you must apply this determination to a financial arrangement for the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must measure the expected component as at the time you enter the financial arrangement. You must also recognise the unexpected component when it is realised. (4) To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates at the time you enter the financial arrangement and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the financial arrangement. (5) You must measure the unexpected component as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. (6) If you must apply this determination for the first time to a financial arrangement for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, and you have not applied Determination G9B for the financial arrangement, you must measure the expected component as at the end of the income year. You must follow the principle set out above by calculating the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD payments up to the end of the income year in which you first apply the determination and the forward rates at the end of that income year. (7) Again, you must recognise the unexpected component when it is realised. Transitional adjustment (8) For the first income year for which you must use this determination, you must perform the transitional adjustment calculation to calculate gross income or expenditure for all financial arrangements— (a) that you entered before the income year; and (b) for which you have not been required to use Determination G9B. (9) This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you first use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in subparagraph (4), and this determination had been used since you became a party to the financial arrangement. 10 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) In this determination— base currency in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency or commodity in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed covered interest parity means the proposition that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 period ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by 1 plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by 1 plus the domestic interest rate, i d . Forward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as— (1 + i f ) n Fwd t,n = S t × (1 + i d ) n currency includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement exchange rate means the price of 1 currency expressed in another currency financial arrangement has the same meaning as in the Act: Provided that, where a financial arrangement creates obligations in 2 or more currencies or commodities and the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each of the currencies is separately identifiable, the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each currency will be treated as relating to separate financial arrangements floating rate arrangement means a financial arrangement where the interest rate is reset periodically according to a predetermined formula, linking the interest rate to an indicator rate such as the bank bill or interbank rate forward rate means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case where the base currency is a commodity, the forward rate is the future value of the commodity (in NZD) future value in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially acceptable, market-based method of valuation GBP means the currency of the United Kingdom 11 initial interest rate in relation to a financial arrangement means the interest rate that applies to the first period after the date of issue or acquisition of the financial arrangement interest means any periodic payment in relation to the financial arrangement, to the extent intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower. It does not include fees, discounts, premiums, or payments effecting a reduction of principal NZD means the currency of New Zealand period means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable, and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable reviewable rate arrangement means a financial arrangement where the interest rate is set periodically in line with market rates spot rate means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity spot value in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation USD means the currency of the United States of America variable rate financial arrangement means a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. (3) All other terms used have the meaning given to them for the purpose of the Act. 6. Method (1) Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a financial arrangement under this determination is the total of— (a) the expected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (2) to (5); and (b) the unexpected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (6). (2) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a financial arrangement is the income year in which you become a party to the financial arrangement, you must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the financial arrangement as at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the financial arrangement. 12 (3) You must calculate the base currency payments of a variable rate financial arrangement denominated in a currency other than NZD using the initial interest rate and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. (4) You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates as at the time you became a party to the financial arrangement. (5) You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (6) You must calculate and recognise the unexpected component for each income year. The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under subparagraph (4). (7) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a financial arrangement is after the income year in which you entered the financial arrangement, and you have not been required to use Determination G9B for the financial arrangement, you must follow the method set out in subparagraphs (1) to (6) to calculate gross income or expenditure of the financial arrangement, except that— (a) the NZD net amount to be spread under subparagraph (5) consists of— (i) actual NZD payments that have occurred since you became a party to the financial arrangement until the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination; (ii) expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement; and (b) the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination for the financial arrangement. Transitional adjustment for existing financial arrangements (8) You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation for the first income year for which you must use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement if you entered the financial arrangement before the income year and have not been required to apply Determination G9B to the financial arrangement. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for each such financial arrangement in accordance with the following formula: 13 a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the financial arrangement b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the financial arrangement c is the sum of all income in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the first income year for which you must use this determination. 7. Examples (1) A New Zealand investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2005. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2009. (2) The New Zealand investor has to calculate the expected NZD net amount on the basis of forward rates available at the time it becomes a party to the financial arrangement. It then has to spread and allocate the expected NZD net amount to the income years over the term of the financial arrangement in accordance with Determination G3 and Determination G1A. In each of those income years, the investor also has to determine the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure. The unexpected component is measured as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. Further examples are provided in the schedule. Signed on the 3 rd day of June 2004. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy 14 Schedule: Further examples Note: In each example involving a base price adjustment, the base price adjustment is calculated on the assumption that the financial arrangement is subject to Division 2 of Part EH of the Act. The details of the calculation would differ for a financial arrangement that was subject to Division 1 of Part EH of the Act. Example A: Discounted bond A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2005. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2009. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates. The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the US (US,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the time of contract. In this simple example the (US,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6-month bond and a 5-year bond have the same rate).

The expected NZD net amount represents a yield of approximately 12% per annum over the 5-year period and the yield is spread in a way consistent with Determination G3. The value of NZD $848,432, for instance, is the expected component of the gross income for the NZ investor for the 6-month period ending 1 March 2005. 15 Date (a) USD Cash (b) Expected Cash (NZD) (c) Expected Income 1-Sep-04 −8,300,000 −13,153,724 1-Mar-05 500,000 784,846 848,432 1-Sep-05 500,000 777,372 852,533 1-Mar-06 500,000 769,968 857,381 1-Sep-06 500,000 762,635 863,020 1-Mar-07 500,000 755,372 869,494 1-Sep-07 500,000 748,178 876,855 1-Mar-08 500,000 741,052 885,155 1-Sep-08 500,000 733,995 894,450 1-Mar-09 500,000 727,004 904,800 1-Sep-09 10,500,000 15,121,690 916,268 6,700,000 8,768,389 8,768,389 6-Month YTM 7% 6% When cash is subsequently received at the relevant dates, the NZD values of the payments are likely to differ from those expected at the contract date. Where the NZD values of these subsequent payments deviate from the expected NZD values, they give rise to unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure. For example, on 1 March 2005 the actual payment was NZD $774,593 while the expected payment was NZD $784,846. The discrepancy of NZD $10,253 is the unexpected component for the period ending 30 June 2005. Date Expected Cash (NZD) Actual Cash (NZD) Unexpected Income/ Expenditure 1-Sep-04 −13,153,724 −13,153,724 1-Mar-05 784,846 774,593 −10,253 1-Sep-05 777,372 769,231 −8,141 1-Mar-06 769,968 763,359 −6,609 1-Sep-06 762,635 761,035 −1,600 1-Mar-07 755,372 759,878 4,506 1-Sep-07 748,178 781,250 33,072 1-Mar-08 741,052 783,699 42,647 1-Sep-08 733,995 813,008 79,013 1-Mar-09 727,004 813,008 86,004 1-Sep-09 15,121,690 17,073,171 1,951,480 8,768,389 2,170,119 At the first balance date – 30 June 2005 There are 2 components to the income or expenditure for the financial arrangement in this income year: the gains expected at the contract date and the unexpected losses. The expected gains as summarised above are allocated to the income year in a way consistent with Determination G1A. Therefore, the gross income or expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2005 is— 16 ($848,432) + (121/184 × $852,533) – $10,253 = $1,398,812 where NZD $1,398,812 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2006 is calculated as— (63/184 × $852,533) + ($857,381) +(121/184 × $863,020) – $8,141 – $6,609 = $1,702,060 where NZD $1,702,060 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the third balance date – 30 June 2007 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2007 is calculated as— (63/184 × $863,020) + ($869,494) + (121/184 × $876,855) – $1,600 + $4,506 = $1,744,518 where NZD $1,744,518 is gross income of the NZ investor. On 30 September 2007 the bond is sold for USD $10,000,000 (i.e. an approximate yield of 16% pa). At this date the USD/NZD spot rate was 0.6320. At this date the investor is subject to the base price adjustment under section EH 47— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company: = 500,000/.6455 + 500,000/.6500 + 500,000/.6550 + 500,000/.6570 + 500,000/.6580 + 500,000/.6400 + 10,000,000/.6320 − 8,300,000/.6310 = $20,432,131 − $13,153,724 = NZD $7,278,407 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 1,398,812 + 1,702,060 + 1,744,518 (as calculated above) = $4,845,390 NZD expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. So the base price adjustment is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted = 7,278,407 – 4,845,390 + 0 + 0 = NZD $2,433,017. 17 Since this is a positive amount it is gross income of the NZ investor in this income year. Example B: Discounted bond entered into before the 2003-04 income year A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2004. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2007. This is effectively the same as Example A except that the discounted bond was acquired on 1 September 2002. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates as in Example A. Date Spot Fwd (0,t) US,I NZ,I 1-Sep-02 0.6310 0.6310 0.05 0.04 1-Mar-03 0.6455 0.6371 0.05 0.04 1-Sep-03 0.6500 0.6432 0.05 0.04 1-Mar-04 0.6550 0.6494 0.05 0.04 1-Sep-04 0.6570 0.6556 0.05 0.04 1-Mar-05 0.6580 0.6619 0.05 0.04 1-Sep-05 0.6400 0.6683 0.05 0.04 1-Mar-06 0.6380 0.6747 0.05 0.04 1-Sep-06 0.6150 0.6812 0.05 0.04 1-Mar-07 0.6150 0.6878 0.05 0.04 1-Sep-07 0.6150 0.6944 0.05 0.04 In the 2003–04 income year – 30 June 2004 The gross income or expenditure under the discounted bond has been calculated in previous income years according to Determination G9A. The corporate has already recognised gross income of $1,398,812 in the 30 June 2003 income year. However, the corporate has elected to adopt this determination from the 2003–04 income year. The expected NZD net amount to be spread under this determination must, therefore, be determined at the end of the 2003–04 income year. The following table summarises the actual payments from 1 September 2002 to the end of the 2003– 04 income year and the expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement. These expected NZD payments were calculated on the basis of the forward rates at 30 June 2004 out to the relevant dates. For the sake of simplicity, these forward rates are assumed to be the same, in this example, as those measured at the time of contract. In practice, however, the forward rates measured at the time of contract are rarely the same as the forward rates measured at a later date. 18 Date Expected Cash (NZD) Expected Income 1-Sep-02 −13,153,724 1-Mar-03 774,593 845,427 1-Sep-03 769,231 849,980 1-Mar-04 763,359 855,170 1-Sep-04 762,635 861,071 1-Mar-05 755,372 867,397 1-Sep-05 748,178 874,598 1-Mar-06 741,052 882,723 1-Sep-06 733,995 891,829 1-Mar-07 727,004 901,973 1-Sep-07 15,121,690 913,219 8,743,386 6-Month YTM 6% At the end of the 2003–04 income year, the expected NZD net amount in relation to the discounted bond is NZD $8,743,386, representing an annual yield of approximately 12%. The expected NZD net amount is spread over the term of the financial arrangement in a way consistent with Determination G3. The transitional adjustment in the 2003–04 income year is— a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income from the time the financial arrangement was entered into until the end of the 2003–04 income year = 845,427 + 849,980 + 855,170 + 861,071 × 121/184 = $3,116,825 b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure from the time the financial arrangement was entered into until the end of the 2003–04 income year = 0 c is the sum of all income in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year = $1,398,812 d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year =0. The net amount of NZD $1,718,013 is gross income in the 2003–04 income year. The income or expenditure in relation to the discounted bond in subsequent income years will be calculated as in Example A. The expected component of the gross income or expenditure is determined as summarised in the table above while the unexpected component is calculated as in Example A. 19 Example C: Multi-currency loan facility with early repayment A corporate borrower has a multi-currency loan facility that allows funds to be drawn down in any of three currencies—US Dollars (USD), Sterling (GBP) and Deutschemarks (DM). The total initial amount of the loan is USD $100,000,000 and may be taken in any combination of the three currencies. The term of the loan facility is 10 years and any tranche may be repaid at any time by payment of the principal outstanding. The mixture of currencies can be changed at each 6-monthly interest payment date. Interest is payable in the currency of the principal amount at rates depending on the currency as shown below. The loan is initially drawn down on 1 October 2004 in the configuration below. Interest is payable 6-monthly in arrears on 1 February and 1 August. The corporate borrower has a 31 March balance date. Its base currency is NZD. Initial drawn down configuration Currency Amount Spot rate (against USD) USD equiv Interest rate USD $55m $55m 9% GBP STG36m0.5500 $19.8m 11% DM DM60m0.4083 $24.5m 5% Total $99.3m For the purpose of illustration, the spot rates and the forward rates at the initial drawn down date out to the relevant dates for GBP/NZD are presented below. The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the UK (UK,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the initial drawn down date. In this simple example the (UK,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6- month bond and a 10-year bond have the same rate). 20 Date Actual Spot CIP Fwd (0,t) Expected UK,I Expected NZ,I 1-Oct-04 0.3300 0.3300 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-05 0.3345 0.3332 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-05 0.3340 0.3364 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-06 0.3310 0.3396 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-06 0.3184 0.3429 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-07 0.3046 0.3462 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-07 0.3387 0.3495 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-08 0.3024 0.3529 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-08 0.2829 0.3563 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-09 0.3503 0.3597 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-09 0.3736 0.3631 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-10 0.3773 0.3666 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-10 0.3874 0.3702 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-11 0.4034 0.3737 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-11 0.4225 0.3773 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-12 0.4435 0.3809 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-12 0.4414 0.3846 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-13 0.4296 0.3883 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-13 0.3955 0.3920 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-14 0.3953 0.3958 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-14 0.3953 0.3996 0.05 0.04 1-Oct-14 0.3953 0.4034 0.05 0.04 For taxation purposes each of these tranches is treated as a separate financial arrangement. The following example illustrates the way gross income or expenditure with respect to the Sterling (GBP) tranche is calculated at the initial drawn down date and the subsequent balance dates. At the initial drawn down date – 1 October 2004 At the initial drawn down date, the expected payments in GBP and NZD over the 10- year period are as follows: 21 Date (a) GBP Cash (b) Expected Cash NZD (c) Expected Expenditure 1-Oct-04 36,000,000 109,090,909 1-Feb-05 −1,320,000 −3,961,905 4,646,006 1-Aug-05 −1,980,000 −5,886,259 4,675,141 1-Feb-06 −1,980,000 −5,830,199 4,623,561 1-Aug-06 −1,980,000 −5,774,673 4,572,173 1-Feb-07 −1,980,000 −5,719,676 4,520,960 1-Aug-07 −1,980,000 −5,665,203 4,469,909 1-Feb-08 −1,980,000 −5,611,249 4,419,003 1-Aug-08 −1,980,000 −5,557,808 4,368,227 1-Feb-09 −1,980,000 −5,504,877 4,317,565 1-Aug-09 −1,980,000 −5,452,450 4,266,999 1-Feb-10 −1,980,000 −5,400,521 4,216,513 1-Aug-10 −1,980,000 −5,349,088 4,166,088 1-Feb-11 −1,980,000 −5,298,144 4,115,706 1-Aug-11 −1,980,000 −5,247,686 4,065,347 1-Feb-12 −1,980,000 −5,197,708 4,014,993 1-Aug-12 −1,980,000 −5,148,206 3,964 ,624 1-Feb-13 −1,980,000 −5,099,175 3,914,217 1-Aug-13 −1,980,000 −5,050,612 3,863,751 1-Feb-14 −1,980,000 −5,002,511 3,813,205 1-Aug-14 −1,980,000 −4,954,868 3,762,554 1-Oct-14 −36,660,000 −90,866,409 3,711,775 Total −39,600,000 −88,488,316 88,488,316 6-Month YTM 5% 4% On 1 October 2004 the corporate borrower received GBP £36,000,000, which is equivalent to NZD $109,090,909. On 1 February 2005, the interest payment in arrears for the 4 months from the initial drawn down date amounts to GBP £1,320,000, which is equivalent to NZD $3,961,905 (valued at the relevant forward rate of 0.3332 at the initial drawn down date). The subsequent interest payments were also converted to NZD in the same way. Overall NZD net amount of $88,488,316 represent an expected yield of approximately 8% per annum. The expected yield is spread according to Determination G3 (see column (c)). The actual NZD payments will deviate from the expected NZD payments due to fluctuations in the exchange rates. For instance, the actual NZD payment on 1 February 2005 was NZD $3,946,188 instead of NZD $3,961,905 anticipated at the initial drawn down date. This created an unexpected component of NZD $15,716 for the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement. The following table presents the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure over the term of the financial arrangement. 22 Date Expected Cash NZD Actual Cash NZD Unexpected Income/ Expenditure 1-Oct-04 109,090,909 109,090,909 1-Feb-05 −3,961,905 −3,946,188 −15,716 1-Aug-05 −5,886,259 −5,928,144 41,885 1-Feb-06 −5,830,199 −5,981,873 151,674 1-Aug-06 −5,774,673 −6,218,593 443,920 1-Feb-07 −5,719,676 −6,500,328 780,652 1-Aug-07 −5,665,203 −5,845,881 180,678 1-Feb-08 −5,611,249 −6,547,619 936,370 1-Aug-08 −5,557,808 −6,998,940 1,441,131 1-Feb-09 −5,504,877 −5,652,298 147,421 1-Aug-09 −5,452,450 −5,299,786 −152,664 1-Feb-10 −5,400,521 −5,247,813 −152,708 1-Aug-10 −5,349,088 −5,110,996 −238,091 1-Feb-11 −5,298,144 −4,908,280 −389,865 1-Aug-11 −5,247,686 −4,686,391 −561,295 1-Feb-12 −5,197,708 −4,464,487 −733,221 1-Aug-12 −5,148,206 −4,485,727 −662,479 1-Feb-13 −5,099,175 −4,608,939 −490,237 1-Aug-13 −5,050,612 −5,006,321 −44,291 1-Feb-14 −5,002,511 −5,008,854 6,343 1-Aug-14 −4,954,868 −5,008,854 53,986 1-Oct-14 −90,866,409 −92,739,691 1,873,282 Total −88,488,316 2,616,778 At the first balance date – 31 March 2005 Expected component = 4,646,006 + (4,675,141 × 59/181) = $6,169,947. Unexpected component = $15,716. Total gross expenditure = $6,169,947 – $15,716 = $6,154,231. At the second balance date – 31 March 2006 Expected component = (122/181 × 4,675,141) + 4,623,561 + (4,572,173 × 59/181) = $9,265,138. Unexpected component = $41,885 + $151,674 = $193,559. Total gross expenditure = $9,265,138 + $193,559 = $9,458,697. 23 On 1 June 2006 the corporate borrower decides to switch out of GBP and borrow more USD. For the purpose of calculating the corporate’s gross income or expenditure, the GBP tranche is deemed to be repaid and is subject to the base price adjustment in this income year. The spot rate GBP to NZD was 0.3200 on the date of repayment. The base price adjustment is given in section EH 47 of the Act. It calculates an amount by application of the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company. This is equal to the amount of GBP drawn down less the sum of the interest payments made and the deemed principal repayment amount = 36 m/.3300 − (1.32m/.3345 + 1.98 m/.3340 + 1.98m/.3310 + 36m/.3200) = NZD $109,090,909 − NZD $128,356,205 = −NZD $19,265,296 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years. The gross expenditure for the previous 2 years of the loan facility were— for the year ended 31 March 1989 = $6,154,231; for the year ended 31 March 1990 = $9,458,697. The total gross expenditure is 6,154,231 + 9,458,697 = NZD $15,612,928 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. The base price adjustment is therefore— –19,265,296 + 15,612,928 = −NZD $3,652,368. This amount is gross expenditure of the corporate borrower in this income year in accordance with section EH 47 of the Act. Example D: Variable rate financial arrangement This example is similar to Example D in Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements. This example illustrates how this determination could be applied to a variable rate financial arrangement. A New Zealand company purchased a USD note with a face value of $10,000 for a term of 3 years at a discount of 10% ($1,000). The interest rate is equal to market interest plus 1% pa, and interest is payable half-yearly in arrears. There are no fees. The interest rate is 10% in the first period after issue. 24 Assuming that this interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 14.2% pa, calculated at half-yearly rests. The table below summarises the expected base currency payments and the relevant spot and forward exchange rates. t USD Cash Spot Fwd (0,t) US,I NZ,I 0 −9,000 0.6310 0.6310 0.05 0.04 1 500 0.6455 0.6371 0.05 0.04 2 500 0.6500 0.6432 0.05 0.04 3 500 0.6550 0.6494 0.05 0.04 4 500 0.6570 0.6556 0.05 0.04 5 500 0.6580 0.6619 0.05 0.04 6 10,500 0.6400 0.6683 0.05 0.04 14.2% At the time of entering into the floating arrangement, the New Zealand company needs to make the following calculation: t USD Cash Expected Cash NZD Expected Income 0 −9,000−14,263 1 500785868 2 500777873 3 500770879 4 500763885 5 500755893 6 10,500 15,712 901 4,0005,2995,299 14.2%12.2% The base currency payments, calculated on the basis of the initial interest rate (i.e. 10%), are translated into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates available at the time the company entered into the financial arrangement.

The expected component of the gross income or expenditure for each half-year period over the term of the arrangement is presented in the final column of the table above. When payments are subsequently made, the actual NZD payments may differ from the expected NZD payments due to fluctuations in both the interest rates and the exchange rates. The final outcomes are presented in the following table: 25 t Actual US,I Actual Cash USD Expected Cash NZD Actual Cash NZD Unexpected Income/ Expenditure 0 −9,000−14,263−14,263 0 1 0.10 500785775 −10 2 0.11 500777846 69 3 0.09 500770687 −83 4 0.09 500763685 −78 5 0.08 500755608 −147 6 0.08 10,50015,71216,250 538 At the first balance date There are 2 components to the gross income or expenditure in relation to the floating rate financial arrangement for the New Zealand company. These include— Expected component = $868 + $873 = $1,741; and Unexpected component = −$10 + $69 = $59. The gross income for the first balance date is therefore $1,800. At the second balance date The gross income consists of— Expected component = $879 + $885 = $1,764; and Unexpected component = −$83 – $78 = −$161. The gross income for the second balance date is therefore $1,603. At the final balance date The New Zealand company has to perform a base price adjustment under section EH 47 of the Act— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 775 + 846 + 687 + 685 + 608 + 16,250 − 14,263 = NZD $5,588 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years 1,800 + 1,603 = NZD $3,403 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 26 So the base price adjustment is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted = 5,588 – 3,403 + 0 + 0 = NZD $2,185. Since this is a positive amount, it is gross income of the New Zealand company in this income year.

The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended the Goods & Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to allow supplies of financial services by a GST-registered person to another GST-registered person to be zero-rated. The changes integrate the supply of financial services more fully into the GST system by taxing such supplies at the rate of 0% and allowing financial services providers to deduct input tax in respect of those supplies. 1 This is in contrast to the ìexemptî treatment of financial services, whereby GST is not charged and financial services providers cannot deduct input tax for GST paid on goods and services used in supplying financial services. 2. From 1 January 2005 the zero-rating rules 2 allow providers to elect to zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers who: • are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies 3 made by the customer in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) is equal to or exceeds 75 percent of their total supplies for the period; • may not meet the 75 percent threshold but are part of a group that does meet the threshold in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) ñ for example, the treasury or finance function of a group of companies who receives financial services. Note: The treatment of financial services supplied to unregistered persons remains unchanged. Supplies to final consumers in New Zealand are still exempt supplies and cannot be zero-rated under these guidelines. 3. From 1 January 2005 the GST Act also provides an additional deduction from output tax for supplies of financial services made to another financial services provider, which in turn makes supplies to businesses that would qualify to receive zero-rated financial services. 4 The amount that can be deducted will be determined by the ratio of taxable to non-taxable supplies made by the recipient financial services provider. 5 The formula for calculating the value of the deduction is set out in these guidelines, but is generally based on the recipientsí relative proportions of business and non-business customers. 1 See Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 16 No. 1 February 2004 pp 23 to 31 for a discussion on the legislative amendments contained in the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 2 See sections 11A(1)(q) and (r). 3 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 4 See section 20(3)(h). 5 See section 20C. 2 4. These guidelines set out Inland Revenueís generally approved method for zero-rating supplies of financial services. 6 5. They also set out the application of the various deductions allowed for financial services providers as input tax under the GST Act. 7 What is a ìfinancial serviceî? 6. Although many activities may be thought of as a ìfinancial serviceî, for the purposes of the GST Act, the term ìfinancial servicesî generally applies to the following types of transaction: 8 • dealings with money; • certain dealings with securities; • the provision of credit and loans; • the provision of life insurance (including superannuation); • the provision of non-deliverable futures contracts and financial options; • the payment and collection of interest, principal, dividends and amounts relating to transactions involving securities; and • intermediation and brokerage services relating to the supply of debt, equity and life insurance. 7. Services that are not treated as financial services include debt collection, equipment leasing, credit control, sales ledger and accounting services, investment guidance, fire and general insurance and the provision of advice. Examples of financial services include: • paying or collecting any amount of interest; • providing or brokering mortgages and other loans; • issuing securities such as stocks and shares; • providing credit under a credit contract; • exchanging currency (for example, changing US$ into NZ$). 6 The authority for these guidelines is provided in section 20E. 7 See section 20(3). 8 See section 3. 3 Scope and purpose of the guidelines 8. These guidelines apply to financial services providers that are GST-registered, or liable to be registered for GST, who supply financial intermediation services. Financial intermediation services are those that bring together suppliers and consumers of financial services. Examples include deposit-taking intermediation, which involves bringing together suppliers and users of financial capital, and brokerage services involving the buying and selling of financial instruments and currencies. 9. The guidelines do not apply to persons that do not supply financial services as part of their normal business activity ñ for example, one-off or isolated transactions that do not constitute a wider activity involving supplies to another person for a consideration, activities that involve only holding securities belonging to another entity, and the issue of capital in a company or trust. These activities are generally not considered on their own to constitute a taxable or exempt activity for GST purposes. 9 However, whether or not a particular financial service constitutes such an activity needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any questions regarding whether or not a financial activity is a taxable or exempt activity should be directed to Inland Revenue or a tax advisor. 10. The application of the zero-rating rules requires providers to know, at a minimum, whether their customer is registered for GST and the ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies made by the customer. Under the GST Act, these tests must, in the first instance, be applied on a transaction-by-transaction basis. However, to recognise the costs that could arise in meeting these requirements, the GST Act allows providers to apply an alternative method approved by Inland Revenue, either generally or by specific agreement. Alternative approaches 11. Providers may seek approval from Inland Revenue to use a different method from that specified in the guidelines for zero-rating supplies of financial services, provided it produces as fair and reasonable a result as identifying eligible customers on a transaction-by-transaction basis would. 10 Otherwise, providers may either apply these guidelines or zero-rate supplies of financial services on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as required by the GST Act. 12. Inland Revenue may also agree to an alternative method for determining the extent to which goods and services are applied for making taxable and non-taxable supplies for the purpose of adjusting deductions of input tax. Approval will always be dependent on the alternative producing a fair and reasonable result. 11 9 See section 6 and also see Taupo Iki Nui Body Corporate v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147 and Polysar Investments Netherlands BV v Inspecteur der Invoerrechten en Accijnzen 1993 (Case C- 60/90). 10 See section 20E. 11 See section 21A. 4 Summary of guideline options 13. Providers have the following choices if they elect to use the zero-rating rules and deduct input tax for GST paid on making zero-rated supplies of financial services. Options Topic Relevant sections in the GST Act Option 1 Use these guidelines Option 2 Not use the guidelines Option 3 Obtain a specific method Zero-rating Sections 3 and 11A(1)(q) and (r) See paragraphs 22 to 52 Zero-rate on a transaction-by- transaction basis Apply in writing to Inland Revenue to use an alternative method Principal purpose / change-in-use adjustments Sections 20(3)(e) and 21 to 21G See paragraphs 56 to 77 Use the principal purpose test or direct attribution to deduct input tax Apply in writing to Inland Revenue to use an alternative method Deductions from output tax Deduction for supplies between financial services providers Sections 20(3)(h) and 20C See paragraphs 78 to 90 References 14. Unless otherwise specified, all section references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Election into the new GST rules 15. The GST Act requires providers to give written notice to Inland Revenue if they wish to zero-rate supplies of financial services and/or be eligible to deduct input tax for supplies of financial services made to other financial services providers. 16. This means if the compliance costs of zero-rating outweigh the benefits, providers can choose not to elect into the new provisions. 17. Elections will take effect from the first day of the taxable period in which Inland Revenue receives the written notice. 18. An election will cease from the end of the taxable period: • in which the provider ceases to carry on a taxable activity; or • that is nominated by the provider in a written notice, if the date nominated is after the taxable period in which Inland Revenue receives notice; or • in which Inland Revenue receives written notice if the provider does not nominate a taxable period. 5 19. Elections should be addressed to: Inland Revenue Corporates Financial Sector Private Bag 39984 Wellington Fax (04) 802-6192 Who to contact 20. Any questions in relation to these guidelines should be directed to Inland Revenue on 0800 377 776. Financial services providers who are companies or groups of companies with an annual turnover in excess of $100 million or whose industry is governed by specific tax legislation should call Inland Revenue on 0800 443 773. Penalties and interest 21. Providers are responsible for complying with the various Inland Revenue Acts and may face penalties and interest if they do not meet the obligations set out in those Acts. Information about obligations, penalties and interest can be found in the Inland Revenue publication Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties (IR240), which is available on the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz. Zero-rating Paragraphs 22 to 52 set out Inland Revenueís approved method for applying the zero-rating rules in relation to supplies of financial services. Financial services providers who have elected to zero-rate supplies using the guidelines must comply with these paragraphs. General application 22. The zero-rating rules allow providers to: • Zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers who are registered for GST if the level of taxable supplies made by the customer 12 in a given 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) is equal to or exceeds 75 percent of their total supplies for the period. • Zero-rate supplies of financial services to customers who may not meet the 75 percent threshold but are part of a group that does meet the threshold in a given 12 Excluding supplies of financial services zero-rated under sections 11A(1)(q) and/or (r). 6 12-month period (including the taxable period in which the supply is made) ñ for example, the treasury or finance function of a group of companies that receives financial services. 23. Supplies of financial services cannot be zero-rated if: • they are supplied to businesses whose activity of making exempt supplies of financial services and other non-financial exempt supplies is more that 25 percent of their total supplies; or • they are supplied to unregistered persons (or final consumers). 24. When making a decision on whether or not a supply of financial services should be zero-rated, all necessary steps must be undertaken to ensure that the decision is correct. Evidential requirements 25. It is important to keep adequate books and records to substantiate any decisions to zero- rate financial services to customers, undertake regular reviews of any systems and procedures used to categorise customers and generally comply with the tax law. It is also necessary to have a process that enables those decisions to zero-rate services to be reviewed each year. The review process need not be comprehensive but it is expected that a reasonable sample of data of at least 10 percent in total across all customer, industry and business groups will be selected and tested. If a material level of inconsistency is detected, Inland Revenue expects that the provider will undertake a more rigorous review and corrective programme. 26. If the financial services provider is aware that a customer is no longer eligible to receive zero-rated supplies, zero-rating should cease. For one-off transactions a review will not necessarily be required ñ see paragraph 38. 27. Records that Inland Revenue expects to be maintained in relation to this part of the guidelines include communications with customers with regard to their registration status and the 75 percent threshold. Identifying eligible customers 28. Unlike the usual GST rules, the zero-rating rules impose a requirement that providers obtain information about their customers. This is intended to ensure that the deductions of input tax that result from applying the zero-rating rules relate only to supplies made to qualifying businesses. Supplies to unregistered customers remain treated as exempt supplies. Input tax cannot be recovered in respect of supplies to these customers. 7 29. It is expected that the determination of the taxable status of a customer will be made by the provider supplying the financial services. The reason for this is that the difference between the supply of zero-rated financial services and exempt financial services is the respective ability or inability to deduct input tax in respect of those supplies. The deduction of input tax is therefore a matter for the provider ñ not the recipient to determine. 30. The questions that should be considered when determining whether a supply of financial services should be zero-rated are illustrated below. Applying the zero-rating rules \* The test of reasonable expectation applies if providers adopt the Inland Revenue approved method of using ANZSIC codes as described at paragraphs 40 to 51. Zero-rating supplies of financial services 31. The zero-rating rules therefore require that providers consider two questions in relation to their customersí activities: • The registration test: Is the customer registered for GST? • The 75 percent test: Has the customer made, or is likely to make, in the relevant taxable period supplies of goods and services that are taxable supplies that represent 75 percent or more of total supplies? Is the supply a supply of financial services as defined in section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? Zero-rating does not apply Yes Yes No Is the recipient a registered person? Is the recipient a person who makes, or is reasonably expected to make, taxable supplies that represent 75% or more of their total supplies?\* Zero-rating applies Yes No No 8 Note: When establishing whether or not a customer qualifies under the 75 percent test, all taxable supplies made by the customer should be considered, except for supplies of financial services that are zero-rated under the new rules. Imported services that are treated as supplies for the purpose of the ìreverse chargeî 13 should also be excluded for the purposes of this test. 32. Assessing whether the customer qualifies under both limbs must occur in the taxable period in which the supply of financial services is made. 33. If the customer is part of a group, the tests may be applied by reference to the group of which the customer is a member. 14 General requirements 34. Two options may be adopted in relation to the application of the new zero-rating rules ñ a transaction-based approach or a customer account approach. The option selected should best suit the customer and the type of financial service supplied. 35. Both options will generally require providers to enquire directly whether or not the customer is registered for GST. Financial services providers may approach Inland Revenue with the view to using an alternative method to determine whether or not a customer is registered for GST. 15 Approval of an alternative method will depend on the level of existing information that the financial services provider holds on its customers and whether the alternative method provides a fair and reasonable result ñ see paragraph 11. 36. Again, for both options, whether the customer meets the 75 percent test must be determined either on the basis of information held by the provider on the customer or by using the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification codes (ANZSIC codes). A full list of ANZSIC codes may be found on the Statistics New Zealand website. 16 13 See section 5B and see GST guidelines for recipients of imported services and Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 16 No. 1 February 2004 pp 32 to 45 for a discussion on the reverse charge. 14 In section 11A(1)(r) the term ìgroupî is defined by reference to section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. A group is defined as two or more persons that have an aggregate common voting interest greater than or equal to 66 percent. 15 For example, Inland Revenue may, depending on the integrity of information held by a providerís internal systems, accept a determination on a customerís registration status on the basis of whether the customer has elected to be covered by the protections and provisions provided for under the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. A customer that elects to be covered by that Act must be treated as an unregistered person. 16 See: http://www.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/web/carsweb.nsf/94772cd5918085044c2567e6007eec2c/5b3e1b99a0d 86615cc256cec007e6b14?OpenDocument 9 Determining eligibility per transaction 37. If the supply is in relation to a hire-purchase, finance lease or transaction for which the terms and conditions of the financial service are unlikely to change, the assessment of whether the customer qualifies to receive zero-rated financial services should be established at the time agreement is reached on the contractual terms of the financial service. As GST is a tax on transactions involving the supply of goods and services, any capital or principal arising from the contract should be ignored. 17 Instead, attention should be given to the interest/income margin arising from the transaction because it approximates the value of the intermediation services provided. 38. If the duration of the arrangement is short term ñ no more than three years ñ and the terms and conditions of the financial service cannot be altered over that period, providers may exclude these arrangements from any annual review provided that adequate care is taken in determining the eligibility of the customer at the time the arrangement was established. Any arrangement that has an indefinite duration or a duration of more than three years may be required to be periodically reviewed ñ see paragraph 25. Example ñ loan to a bakery A local bakery approaches a finance company to assist with the acquisition of new equipment. The finance company offers the bakery a two-year table loan and asks the bakery to confirm whether or not it is registered for GST, in case the bakery defaults on the loan and the finance company is required to sell the equipment to recover the debt. As the transaction is largely a one-off arrangement and the cash flows are fixed over the period of the loan (which is short-term), the finance company is not required to include the arrangement in any future internal review. The finance company, having made the assessment that the bakery also meets the 75 percent taxable supply test, may zero-rate the table loan. Determining eligibility per customer account 39. If a number of financial services are likely to be supplied to the same customer and/or the cash flows arising under a financial transaction are uncertain ñ for example, because of a revolving credit facility or regular transactions involving financial instruments/assets, applying the zero-rating rules on a transaction-by-transaction basis is likely to be difficult. To deal with this, the customerís initial eligibility to receive zero-rated financial services must be established at the time the account is created and may be used going forward, provided that the customerís eligibility is reviewed periodically. Again, rather than considering the capital or principal cash flows to and from the account facility, the provider should take account of the interest/income margin arising from the transaction because it approximates the value of the intermediation services provided. 17 An exception applies to finance lease contracts. See ìGST and finance leases ñ classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clauseî, Tax Information Bulletin, Volume Eight, No. 1 July 1996. 10 Example ñ overdraft facility provided to a new bridal store A finance company provides an overdraft facility to a new bridal store that is just starting up. As the owner is still outfitting new premises and has yet to maintain a stable income flow, the business requires a flexible source of financing to meet its day-to-day expenses. On the application form for the overdraft the finance company asks whether or not the bridal shop is registered for GST and the purpose of the overdraft. If, in reviewing the terms and conditions under which the advance is given, the finance company becomes aware that the bridal storeís eligibility to receive zero-rated supplies has altered, zero-rating should cease. Zero-rating using ANZSIC codes 40. Acknowledging the difficulties that may arise when seeking information from customers in relation to their level of taxable supplies, Inland Revenue will accept the use of ANZSIC codes as complying with the second limb (the 75 percent test) of the zero-rating rules. This means that it is not generally necessary to seek information from customers directly in respect of their level of taxable supplies, but providers are still generally expected to enquire as to whether their customers are registered for GST. 41. For the purposes of the 75 percent test, customers that can be allocated an ANZSIC code, other than those listed in tables A and B, 18 may be treated as making taxable supplies that exceed the threshold. Providers are not required to enquire directly from their customers as to their ANZSIC code but can make their own judgement as to what ANZSIC code best applies. If, for whatever reason, a customer cannot readily be allocated an ANZSIC code providers can either seek information from the customer directly or treat any supplies of financial services to that customer as an exempt supply. 42. If the customer is part of a group, the ANZSIC code applied should be representative of the predominant activity undertaken by the group of which the customer is a member. 43. Any system or procedure used to allocate an ANZSIC code must provide the necessary accuracy and be subject to yearly internal audit and review ñ see paragraph 25. Note: Providers that have reliable information concerning the actual activity of a customer must use this information instead of relying on ANZSIC codes. 18 See paragraph 50. 11 ANZSIC codes ñ an explanation 44. ANZSIC codes are used in New Zealand and Australia for the production and analysis of industry statistics. The objective of the codes is to identify groupings of businesses that carry out similar economic activities. Each code defines an industry and the similar economic activities which characterise the businesses involved in that industry by reference to the primary activity undertaken. In principle, any individual business can be assigned an appropriate industry category on the basis of its predominant activity. 45. When applying the ANZSIC codes for the purposes of the zero-rating rules, the term ìbusinessî includes companies, partnerships, trusts, non-profit organisations and government departments. 46. ANZSIC codes are structured according to divisions (the broadest level), subdivisions, groups and classes (the finest level). At the division level there are 17 divisions that are identified by an alphabetical character. A Agriculture, forestry and fishing B Mining C Manufacturing D Electricity, gas and water supply E Construction F Wholesale trade G Retail trade H Accommodation, cafes and restaurants I Transport and storage J Communication services K Finance and insurance L Property and business services M Government administration and defence N Education O Health and community services P Cultural and recreational services Q Personal and other services 47. The subdivision, group and class levels provide increasingly detailed classification of the broad categories. For example, in the case of fire and general insurance, any business that is primarily involved in this activity would be allocated ANZSIC code K7422, which is derived from the following: Division K Subdivision 74 Group 742 Class 7422 12 Using ANZSIC codes 48. When using ANZSIC codes to determine whether a customer meets the 75 percent test, providers should refer to the class level, represented by a four-digit code, that is relevant to the customerís predominant activity. Some class codes may have more than four digits ñ if this occurs, refer only to the first four. The codes will also sometimes appear with or without the alphabetical character. For the purposes of these guidelines, the class code should be read as including the alphabetical character. 49. If a customerís activity is represented by a code that appears on either tables A or B (subject to paragraph 50) providers will not be able to zero-rate supplies of financial services to that customer. For conciseness, certain activities listed on tables A and B are referred to only by the first two or three digits (representing the subdivision or group classification). Any customer that is allocated a code that starts with those digits cannot receive zero-rated financial services. 50. Customers that are allocated a code that is listed on table A will be treated as not having an activity that complies with the 75 percent test. Customers that are allocated a code that is listed on table B will be treated as not having an activity that complies with the 75 percent test unless information is received from the customer that clearly demonstrates otherwise. If the customer provides written evidence of having an activity of making taxable supplies of goods and services exceeding the 75 percent threshold providers may zero-rate any supplies of financial services to that customer. 51. Codes that are not contained in tables A or B may be treated as complying with the 75 percent test.

The company conducts a review of its business clients that are involved in a number of activities and categorizes them as follows: Client Registered for GST? ANZSIC code Zero-rate? Bakery Y G5124 Y Builder Y E4111 ? Butcher Y G5121 Y Café Y H5730 Y Cash loan business Y K7330 N Cattery ? Q9529 ? Charity Y Q9629 ? Dairy Y G5110 Y Florist Y G5254 Y Fruiterer Y G5122 Y Hairdresser N Q9526 N Health food shop Y G5129 Y Independent bookseller Y G5243 Y Lawyer Y L7834 Y Pharmacist Y G5251 Y Second-hand goods dealer Y G5252 Y Sports club Y P9319 Y Toymaker Y C2329 Y Watchmaker Y G5255 or G5269 ? 14 Making further inquiries: From the review, the finance company decides that it needs to gather more information from the cattery, charity and watchmaker in order to work out whether or not they can receive zero-rated supplies of financial services. The cattery The finance company has some doubt about whether or not the cattery is registered for GST. It telephones the cattery owner to establish whether it is registered for GST and the nature of the supplies made. She confirms that the business is registered for GST and has a taxable activity. The finance company makes the assessment that the cattery qualifies to receive zero-rated financial supplies. The charity The charity has an activity that largely involves the provision of emergency housing and supplying donated goods. It does not charge for the provision of the emergency housing and receives a small revenue stream from the sale of the donated goods. The charity is very dependent on donations to maintain its operations. As most of the supplies made by the charity are exempt, the finance company decides that the charity cannot receive zero- rated financial services. The watchmaker The watchmaker sells and restores watches and clocks, including repairing and servicing personal watches and selling watch accessories. The watchmaker holds some fine gold as stock for restoration purposes but does not sell it separately. He also sells a number of restored pieces on credit and estimates that 15 percent of his annual income is from interest on those accounts. He makes input tax adjustments in respect of those supplies. The finance company seeks further confirmation of the level of exempt supplies made by the watchmaker and, on the basis of that information, decides that the business is eligible to receive zero-rated financial services as the level of exempt supplies does not exceed 25 percent. Unregistered persons 52. Supplies of financial services to unregistered persons (final consumers) cannot be zero- rated. In some instances, however, final consumers may be provided with financial products and services as part their association with a registered person ñ for example, because they are the owner of a business. In these circumstances, care must be taken that supplies of financial services to final consumers are not zero-rated and continue to be treated as exempt supplies. Example ñ loan for private purposes A local builder approaches a finance company to secure a loan to renovate and modify her family home. On the application form the builder gives her business bank account as the account into which the funds should be deposited. As the reasons specified for the loan relate to the private assets of the builder, the finance company cannot zero-rate the interest in respect of the loan. 15 Deductions from output tax Paragraphs 62 to 77 set out Inland Revenueís approved method for deducting input tax in relation to any taxable, including zero-rated, supplies made by a financial services provider. Financial services providers that have elected to zero-rate supplies of financial services using the guidelines must comply with those paragraphs. Paragraphs 78 to 90 provide guidance on the application of section 20C. Overview 53. The effect of the zero-rating rules is to increase the extent to which providers are able to deduct input tax. This is in contrast to the previous broad exempt treatment of financial services that had applied since 1 October 1986, when GST first applied to goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Exemption means that GST is not charged, and providers are unable to deduct input tax. 54. A further special deduction is allowed in respect of supplies of financial services made to other financial services providers. This deduction is calculated using the formula in paragraph 78. 19 Evidential requirements 55. When deducting input tax, financial services providers must exercise reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a GST return. Providers must hold tax invoices and any necessary calculations, samples and ratios that are used to support the deduction of input tax when apportioning input tax between taxable and non-taxable supplies. Principal purpose test 56. If over 50 percent of a providerís financial services are to qualifying GST-registered customers, or those supplies together with other taxable supplies exceed the 50 percent threshold, the provider will be able to deduct input tax on the basis that its principal purpose is that of making taxable supplies. The principal purpose test allows providers to deduct 100 percent of the GST paid on goods and services acquired in making those taxable supplies. 20 Adjustments to input tax may be required to the extent that there are non-taxable supplies. 21 57. If the providerís principal purpose remains that of making exempt supplies, it will not be able to deduct 100 percent of the GST paid but may, instead, recover a proportion of the GST paid using the rules concerning adjustments for change in use ñ see paragraphs 59 to 61. 19 See section 20C. 20 See section 20(3)(a) and (b). 21 See section 21. 16 Test Input tax that can be claimed Adjustment required? Timing of any adjustment 22 The goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies 100 percent of the GST paid may be deducted Yes, if the goods and services are applied for a purpose of making supplies of non-taxable goods and services At any one of the following times: ñ period-by-period ñ annually ñ one-off The goods and services are not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies No deduction is available Yes, if the goods and services are applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies of goods and services At any one of the following times: ñ period-by-period ñ annually ñ one-off if less than $18,000 or Inland Revenue agrees 58. These guidelines set out a method for financial services providers to determine the deduction of input tax in respect of both their zero-rated supplies and other taxable supplies, focusing primarily on how to value zero-rated supplies for this purpose. Adjustments for change in use 59. If a financial services provider cannot deduct input tax using the principal purpose test, an adjustment may be permitted using the change-in-use provisions. 23 These provisions allow a deduction when goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making non- taxable supplies are applied to making taxable supplies. The deduction allowed under these sections is proportionate to the use to which those goods and services are put. There are a number of adjustment methods by which input tax is allocated between taxable and non- taxable (including exempt) supplies. 60. The methods of allocating input tax are: • Actual use: This method of allocation requires the taxpayer to attribute the use of the goods and services directly to the extent that they are used for a purpose of making taxable supplies. This method should be used in preference to others whenever possible. • Turnover method: This method is used in cases where the actual use method is too difficult to apply ñ for example, in the case of overhead expenses. The formula expressed in the GST Act is: Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period Total value of all supplies for taxable period 22 Any further changes to the timing of any change in use adjustments can only be made with the Commissionerís approval. See sections 21C(4) and 21G(3) depending on the nature of adjustment. 23 See sections 21E to 21G and see Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 12 No. 12 December 2000 pp 31 to 37. 17 • An alternative (or special) method: This method is available, provided that Inland Revenue approves it, if it results in allocated amounts that are as fair and reasonable as under the actual use method. If providers are unable to allocate input tax on the basis of actual use they should use the special method described in paragraphs 62 to 77, or another special method agreed in writing by Inland Revenue ñ see paragraph 12, rather than the turnover method. If a provider has been using a method that is approved by Inland Revenue and it produces a fair and reasonable result, the provider may continue to use that method instead of the one recommended in these guidelines. 61. In all cases the method of allocation used must result in a fair and reasonable allocation of input tax between taxable and other supplies. 24 Valuing supplies of financial services and adjusting for changes in use 62. Financial services providers who do not allocate input tax according to actual use will have to value their supplies of financial services for the purposes of allocating input tax between taxable and exempt supplies. These supplies will need to be valued, usually every taxable period or annually, every time an adjustment for any change in use is made. The valuations will not always be straightforward because, unlike a normal supply of goods and services, the financial services will often not be calculated by reference to an express consideration. 63. The objective of valuing financial services when adjusting for changes in use is to identify charges for financial intermediation rather than valuing the underlying financial instruments involved in the transaction. 25 This is because it is the value of the services that is being measured for GST purposes, not the value of the financial products. 64. When valuing financial intermediation services, it is important that providers disregard amounts received as a result of non-financial transactions and non-financial asset sales such as land, buildings, vehicles and equipment. A non-financial transaction is a supply of goods and services that is not included within the scope of the definition of ìfinancial servicesî for GST purposes. 65. Financial services providers price their intermediation services either by setting a specific, explicit fee or by setting a margin. The net margin can be based on a proportion of a set figure, such as an interest rate or commission percentage (for example, 10% of funds managed) or a difference between rates or percentages (for example, a 2% charge, the difference between a lending rate of 6% and a borrowing rate of 4%). The value of any financial intermediation services supplied should be either the explicit fee charged or the net margin received. 24 See section 21A(3). 25 Also see Commissioners of Customs and Excise v First National Bank of Chicago 1998 (Case C-172/96), European Court of Justice, 14 July 1998. 18 66. Inland Revenue expects that in determining the value of financial margins relevant New Zealand generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) will be applied. Special adjustment method using net margins and gross fees to value financial intermediation services 67. Inland Revenue will accept calculations using net margins and gross fees to value financial intermediation services when making adjustments for changes in use for GST paid on goods and services that are not directly attributed to taxable or exempt supplies. The valuations determined under this method should be recorded as zero-rated supplies in box 6 of the providerís GST return. Example ñ value of supplies as a net margin 68. This special method of valuation requires providers to value the margin derived by way of interest income, net proceeds from transactions in securities and gross fees. It is not necessary to continually review individual loan balances or periodically review the value of individual holdings in securities. 69. Services that are directly charged by way of transaction fees and commissions should be valued at their invoiced price or the gross amount recognised as income for financial reporting purposes. Interest received from advances made $10,000 Interest paid to account holders $8,000 Net interest margin $2,000 19 Formula for valuing change-in-use adjustments under these guidelines Total value of taxable supplies Total value of all supplies The total value of taxable supplies is calculated based on: • net interest from transactions to businesses • net margins from exchange and derivatives transactions to businesses • other net/margin revenue from businesses • gross fees and commissions received from transactions to businesses • all other zero-rated supplies • all supplies that are subject to GST at the rate of 12.5% The total value of all supplies is calculated using: • all net interest • all net margins from exchange and derivative transactions • all other net/margin income • all gross fees and commissions • all other supplies When determining the value of taxable supplies to be included in the formula, providers should be mindful of the following: • Exports: In the absence of directly attributing input tax to any exported goods and services, amounts relating to exports should be included in the numerator. • Imported services: Any imported services that have been subject to the reverse charge must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator. 26 The information required to apply the formula should be able to be sourced from financial statements. Determining the margins from treasury transactions such as foreign exchange and derivative transactions to businesses may require sampling. Any sampling period will need to include the last day of a financial quarter (such as 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December), as this day is typically busier than others. Providers can contact Inland Revenue to ascertain whether the sampling they propose is appropriate to their circumstances. The reference to ìbusinessî means those registered persons that qualify to receive zero-rated supplies ñ meaning the business does not have more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies (less than 25 percent of total turnover in a given 12-month period). 26 See section 5B. =Input tax recovery ratio 20 Valuing supplies of financial services for specific transaction types 70. For specific transaction types, the following will apply. Debt 71. Transactions involving debt are to be valued by reference to the interest margins that arise from the principal. The principal itself should be ignored. If the transaction involves the supply of goods and services under a credit contract or the lease of goods and services under a finance lease, financial services providers should refer to ìGST and finance leases ñ classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clauseî, Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No. 1 July 1996. Equity 72. Intermediation services involving the provision of equity will generally involve a specific fee or commission. If they do not, providers for whom equity is part of a taxable activity should refer to Inland Revenue for specific guidance. Transactions involving the issue or repurchase of a providerís own equity must be ignored. Transactions involving financial instruments such as derivatives and secondary market debt 73. Intermediation services for other financial instruments that do not involve a fee or commission can also be referred to Inland Revenue. Transactions involving the issue or repurchase of a providerís own financial instruments must be ignored. Special transactions 74. When valuing supplies of financial services using net margins and gross fees, some transactions may present special difficulties. Transactions with associated persons 75. As an anti-avoidance measure special valuation rules 27 apply to financial services supplied to an ìassociated personî. 28 When zero-rated financial services are supplied to associated business customers and financial services providers at greater than market value, market value must be used. Otherwise the agreed value can continue to be applied. Net loss margin 76. Sometimes the net margin from a financial instrument will be a net loss ñ for example, when a financial instrument is realised at a loss or a movement in foreign exchange gives rise to a loss under a foreign exchange hedging contract. If this occurs, the margin should be treated as zero for the purposes of the valuation formula. 27 See sections 10(3), 10(3A) and 10(3B). 28 See section 2A. 21 Net treasury income 77. Most financial services providers will engage in transactions using reserves to derive income in addition to that received from any core intermediation activity. This is done as a means of reducing exposures to risk that may arise in respect of transactions with customers that are undertaken as part of that core activity. To the extent that the treasury function is (or is part of) a taxable activity, such transactions should be valued only when financial contracts are closed or financial instruments are realised. The net realised amount is the value that should be included in the valuation formula. 22 Example of making change-in-use adjustments under these guidelines Adjusting for changes in use The finance company makes adjustments for changes in use every year in the taxable period after its end of financial year. The adjustments are based on the accounting reports prepared by the company for the financial year. Adjustments are required for both revenue and capital expenditure. Adjustment worksheet for the period 1/1/2006 to 31/12/2006 Income % taxable $í000 $í000 Interest received (exempt) 14,500 Less interest expense (exempt) 8,700 Net interest (exempt) 5,800 Interest received (taxable) 13,800 Less interest expense (taxable) 11,600 Net interest (taxable) 100% 2,200 Treasury income 7,100 Less Treasury expense 5,100 Net treasury income 80% 2,000 Commissions and fees (exempt) 5,400 Commissions and fees from advisory service 100% 2,820 Total income 18,220 Less provision for doubtful debts 220 Income after provisions 18,000 Operating expenses % taxable use Wages and salaries 7,850 Insurance 2,600 Rental 570 Consultants 100% 1,700 Phone 30 Travel 100% 44 Power 560 Depreciation 240 Selling costs 40% 2,580 Total operating expenses 16,174 Operating surplus before taxation 1,826 Example ñ direct attribution Travel All travel expenses were incurred in relation to the finance companyís business clients and were incurred for the principal purpose of making zero-rated financial services. As the travel expenses can be directly attributed to making taxable supplies, the finance company deducts input tax in the taxable period in which those expenses were incurred. Consultants As part of providing an advisory service to its clients, the finance company contracted various consultants. The cost of these consultants can be directly attributed to providing standard-rated advisory services, so the finance company deducts input tax on the consultantsí fees in the taxable period in which those expenses were incurred. Selling costs The finance company directly attributes 40 percent of its selling costs to supplies of zero-rated financial services to its business clients. 23 Example ñ revenue adjustment The finance company is adjusting office overheads for the taxable supplies made over the year. Over the year it has not deducted input tax in respect of overhead items because these costs have been acquired for the principal purpose of making non-taxable supplies. • Exempt supplies for 12 months $11.6 million ($5.8 + $5.4 + 0.4 million) • Taxable supplies for 12 months $6.62 million ($2.2 + $2.82 + 1.6 million) • Total supplies for 12 months $18.22 million Step 1 Work out the percentage of taxable use for the year. Total value of taxable supplies for period Total value of all supplies for period =% of total supplies that are taxable $6.62 million = 36 percent $18.22 million This is the percentage of taxable supplies. Step 2 Add up expenses over the year on which GST has been paid. Call this amount E. The overheads to be adjusted for the year are: Insurance $2.6 million Rental $0.57 million Phone $0.03 million Power $0.56 million Total $3.76 million Step 3 Multiply E by the taxable percentage from step 1. $3.76 million x 36 percent is $1.3536 million. Step 4 Divide this amount from step 3 by nine. This is the adjustment to show on the IR372 calculation sheet under ìBusiness use of private or exempt goods and services for annual or period-by-period adjustmentsî. Transfer the totals to Box 13 of the GST return. The adjustment the finance company shows on the IR372 calculation sheet is $150,400 ($1.3536 million/9). This represents the input tax that can be deducted in respect of GST incurred on overhead expenses. Example ñ capital adjustment In the same year, the finance company purchases a new office building to cater for new business. The cost of the new building is $8 million including GST. The building is reinforced concrete. The finance company also makes a change-in-use adjustment for the new office building. Note that a capital adjustment can be calculated using the amount determined as depreciation. Step 1 Work out the percentage of taxable use for the year. Total value of taxable supplies for period Total value of all supplies for period =% of total supplies that are taxable $6.62 million = 36 percent $18.22 million This is the percentage of taxable supplies. Step 2 For the taxable period in question, take the lower of the cost or current market value of the goods to be adjustment for taxable supplies. Call this L. The lesser of the cost or open market value is $8 million. Step 3 Find out the straight-line depreciation rate for the asset. Call this S. The general straight line depreciation rate for reinforced concrete buildings is 3 percent. Step 4 LxS x percentage of taxable use from step 1 N N is the number of taxable periods each year in which the change in use adjustments will be made. $8 million x 3 percent x 36 percent = 86,400 1 Step 5 Divide the amount from step 4 by nine. This is the adjustment to show on the IR372 calculation sheet under ìBusiness use of private or exempt goods and services for annual or period-by-period adjustmentsî. Transfer the total to box 13 of the GST return. The adjustment the finance company shows on the IR372 calculation sheet is $9,600 ($86,400/9). This represents the input tax that can be deducted in respect of GST incurred on acquiring the capital asset. 24 Effect on operating profit The adjustments for change in use, made in the first taxable period after 31 December 2006, have the following effect on the finance companyís operating surplus. Income after provisions 18,000 GST content Deductible input tax Revised expenses Operating expenses Wages and salaries - - 7,850 Insurance 288.9 104.0 2,496 Rental 63.3 22.8 547.2 Consultants 212.5 212.5 1,700 Phone 3.3 1.2 28.8 Travel 5.5 5.5 44 Power 62.2 22.4 537.6 Depreciation 26.6 9.6 230.4 Selling costs 300.0 120.0 2,580 Total operating expenses 16,014 Operating surplus before taxation 1,986 Supplies between financial services providers Application 78. Financial services supplied to another financial services provider generally cannot be zero-rated because most financial service providers will not satisfy the requirement that 75 percent of their supplies are taxable supplies. Instead, the GST Act provides a further deduction from output tax in relation to supplies of financial services made to another financial services provider (the direct supplier). The deduction relates only to exempt supplies of financial services made to the direct supplier and is limited to the extent that the direct supplier makes taxable supplies, including supplies of zero-rated financial services, to business customers that meet the 75 percent taxable supplies threshold. The deduction is calculated according to a formula. 29 29 See section 20C. 25 Formula for calculating the deduction for supplies of exempt financial services to other financial services providers a x b x d c e Where: a is the total amount in respect of the taxable period that the registered person ñ (i) would not be able to deduct under section 20(3); and (ii) would be able to deduct under section 20(3), other than under section 20(3)(h), if all supplies of financial services by the financial services provider were taxable supplies: 30 b is the total value of exempt supplies of financial services made to the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period: c is the total value of supplies made in respect of the taxable period: d is the total value of taxable supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D: e is the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier in respect of the taxable period as determined under section 20D. 79. This proportional deduction from output tax is in addition to that which can be recovered as a deduction from output tax using the principal purpose test or by way of a change-in-use adjustment. 80. The proportion is found by multiplying two fractions. The first fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the provider that consists of exempt supplies of financial services to a recipient financial services provider (the direct supplier). The second fraction is the proportion of the total value of supplies made by the direct supplier that consists of taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies of financial services). 81. The formula is limited to the activities of the direct supplier. Further supplies of financial services ñ for example, by the direct supplier to a third or subsequent financial services provider, are not included in the formula. Information required from the direct supplier 82. The method used to determine the deduction is based on statistical information that is provided by the direct supplier in relation to its ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies (items ìdî and ìeî of the formula). 31 The presentation of this statistical information can be in the form of a percentage or fraction. 83. Providers must obtain the ratio from the direct supplier before making the deduction. If a ratio is not provided, the deduction cannot be claimed. 84. The GST Act does not, however, require the direct supplier to provide this information. 30 The definition of item ìaî is in the process of being amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. 31 See section 20D. 26 85. If the direct supplier agrees to provide the necessary statistical information, the GST Act requires that the ratio must be current to each taxable period in which supplies of financial services are made. 32 This will require communication between the financial services provider and the recipient of the financial services regarding the correct ratio to be applied to that taxable period. 86. If the direct supplier provides statistical information which, in the direct supplierís opinion, represents its activities over the last 12 months, that ratio may be applied by the provider for a further 12 months. Accompanying the ratio must be a written statement from the direct supplier that the ratio is a fair reflection of its activities over the last 12 months, including the taxable period in which the ratio is first sought. A new ratio from the direct supplier must be sought at the end of those 12 months. 87. If the provider receives notice from the direct supplier that its ratio is no longer considered accurate or reliable the provider must immediately cease using that ratio and seek an updated one. Evidential requirements 88. To claim the deduction, providers are expected to have written notice or other permanent records of the direct supplierís ratio of taxable to total supplies. 33 This written notice can be in the form of an e-mail or letter. If the information is given by telephone, it must be followed up in writing for evidential purposes. The direct supplier must also state the period of time for which the ratio applies. Disclosing a direct supplier ratio 89. If providers choose to disclose their ratio of taxable to total supplies to other financial services providers, in addition to providing the ratio in writing, they must maintain a regularly updated database of those persons that have received that ratio. The database should also detail the date that ratio was disclosed and the period to which it applies. 90. If providers become aware that the disclosed ratio is materially incorrect they must notify those financial services providers on their database, advising them to cease using the ratio until a new correct ratio is provided. 32 See section 20C. 33 See items d/e as set out in section 20C. 27 Other matters Tax invoices 91. The GST Act requires registered persons to issue a tax invoice in relation to any taxable supplies made to another registered person, if requested. This obligation also applies in relation to zero-rated supplies. In the context of zero-rated financial services (which do not give rise to a deduction of input tax for the recipient), there is no practical purpose in requiring that tax invoices be issued in respect of such supplies. A tax invoice does not, therefore, need to be issued in relation to zero-rated financial services. 34 Transition 92. From 1 January 2005, financial services providers that have elected to apply the new legislation should begin zero-rating supplies of financial services from the first day of the taxable period in which Inland Revenue receives written notice. Deductions of input tax in respect of such supplies should also begin from the same date. 93. Input tax deducted for goods and services consumed in the taxable period in which they were acquired will be determined by reference to the time of supply only. This means that no change-in-use adjustments will be available for such goods and services purchased before the application date, to reflect any increase in taxable supplies after that date. 94. Input tax deducted under the change-in-use provisions for goods and services acquired before the application date but used periodically after that date will able to reflect any increase in taxable supplies after the application date in which the change in use adjustment occurs. 95. One-off change-in-use deductions to take account of any increase in taxable supplies resulting from these reforms are not permitted. 35 Examples ñ transition In July 2003 a finance company acquired a new telephone system and supporting software. The system is treated as a fixed asset and its cost spread over its useful life. As the asset was not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the finance company makes an adjustment to reflect a level of taxable use. Adjustments are made annually. In January 2005 the finance company elects to zero-rate supplies of financial services. It can recognise the higher level of taxable use of the telephone system in its annual adjustment after 1 January 2005. Part-way through 2004, the finance company renews its subscription to an information service. The service is not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and costs less than $18,000. The company does, however, make an one-off adjustment at the time of renewal to reflect that the service is applied for making some taxable supplies. As the subscription is only for a year and the adjustment for taxable use is made before 1 January 2005, the finance company cannot make a further adjustment. 34 See section 24(6)(b). 35 See sections 21G(1B) and 21H(2)(b).
GST guidelines for recipients of imported services October 2004 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department Published October 2004 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. GST guidelines for recipients of imported services. ISBN 0-478-27121-2 Contents The new rules 1 New definitions 1 Application 1 Supply of imported services 2 Registration requirements 5 Related-party transactions 7 Mixed-use acquisitions 9 Zero-rating services consumed wholly outside New Zealand 11 Time of supply rules 12 Transitional provisions 13 Value of supply 13 Documentation requirements 14 1 The new rules 1. The Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to introduce a ìreverse chargeî mechanism to tax certain imports of services ñ for example, management, legal and accounting services, a new software installation (and after-sales service) or products downloaded via the internet. 2. From 1 January 2005 GST-registered recipients of supplies of imported services are required to add GST to the price of the services and include the tax in the normal GST return and pay it to Inland Revenue if: • the services would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand; and • the recipient makes more than a minimal level of exempt or other non-taxable supplies. 3. These guidelines explain how the reverse charge affects these supplies of imported services. New definitions 4. The following definitions have been included in the Act as part of the introduction of the reverse charge: • ìGoodsî means all kinds of personal or real property, but does not include choses in action, money or a product that is transmitted by a non-resident to a resident by means of a wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system or by means of a similar technical system. • ìNon-residentî means a person to the extent that the person is not resident in New Zealand. Application 5. These guidelines apply to a deemed supplier required to self-assess GST on the value of a supply of imported services. For the purposes of GST, a service is anything which is not goods or money. Any business which receives a supply of imported services, or any other person who receives a substantial supply of imported services, is potentially liable to pay GST on the supply. 2 Supply of imported services 6. A supply of imported services is subject to GST if: • the services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a recipient who is a New Zealand resident; • the services are acquired by a person who has not in the last 12 months made (and does not expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies; and • the supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity; 1 The 95 percent threshold is consistent with the 5 percent threshold in the change-in-use adjustment rules. Therefore if a registered person is required to account for the reverse charge, it is likely that the person is already required to make change-in-use adjustments. 7. Supplies of services that would be exempt supplies if made in New Zealand, such as certain financial services, are not subject to the reverse charge. Also, services that would otherwise be subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge can, in most circumstances, be zero-rated under section 11A if they would have been zero-rated had they been supplied in New Zealand. 8. A person required to pay GST under the reverse charge is treated as the supplier of the services for the following purposes: • registration; • payment of output tax; • record keeping; and • avoidance. 9. For all other GST purposes the person is the recipient of services. 1 See section 8(4B) of the Act. 3 Application of the reverse charge Supply from non- resident to resident? Resident a registered person? Taxable supplies < 95%? Supply would be taxable in New Zealand? Yes Yes Yes Yes Value of supply > $40,000? Person required to register No Yes Value of this supply & other taxable supplies > $40,000? No No No No Yes RC applies RC does not apply No 4 Example 1: The operation of the reverse charge Offshore Computer Company NZ Life Insurance Company NZ$1 million NZ Inland Revenue Com puter Pr ogr am m ing Ser vices New ZealandOffshore NZ$125,000 GST An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a New Zealand life insurance company. The life insurance company makes solely exempt supplies of services. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: • The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The services are acquired by a person who has not in the last 12 months made (and does not expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. • The supply of the services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. The New Zealand insurer is required to register for GST if it is not already registered. It is required to account for GST on the value of the supply. The value of the supply is $1 million (the consideration for the supply), so the output tax is $125,000. 5 Example 2: When the reverse charge does not apply Offshore Computer Company NZ Retail Company NZ$1 million Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore Supplies of goods and services - taxable Supplies to non- businesses of financial services - exempt An offshore computer company makes a supply of programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand retail company. The retail company makes a mix of 98 percent taxable supplies of goods and services and 2 percent exempt supplies of financial services, such as hire purchase, to non-registered consumers. It is charged $1 million for the programming services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The two companies are not associated persons. In this situation: • The services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The services are acquired by a person who has, in the last 12 months made (and does expect in the next 12 months to make) supplies of which at least 95 percent in total are taxable supplies. Therefore the supply is not subject to the reverse charge because the New Zealand retailer makes taxable supplies in excess of the 95 percent threshold. Registration requirements 10. Because imported services are treated as having been supplied by the recipient in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient, the value of imported services supplied to that person is included in the total value of supplies made by that person for the purposes of determining liability to register for GST under section 51. Although many businesses making supplies in New Zealand are currently registered for GST, the reverse charge may require others to register ñ in particular, any person importing services as a private consumer. 11. A person must register for GST if: • the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 preceding months exceeds $40,000, or • the total value of supplies made in any month and the 11 following months exceeds $40,000. 6 12. Therefore a person who makes no other taxable supplies in New Zealand may be required to register as a result of importing in excess of $40,000 of services in any 12-month period. Persons who do make other taxable supplies but fall below the $40,000 threshold may be required to register if they import services which, together with other taxable supplies, exceed the threshold. Example 3: Requirement to register for GST ñ importing significant amount of services A wealthy retired businesswoman who is not registered for GST has commissioned the building of a substantial property on the outskirts of Auckland. She contracts Italian architects, designers and landscapers for the project. Plans and drawings are sent to her electronically. She is required to register for GST and pay output tax on the value of those services if, together with any other services she has imported in the same 12-month period, the value exceeds $40,000. Example 4: Requirement to register for GST ñ registration threshold exceeded A business that is not currently required to register for GST makes $39,000 of supplies that would be taxable if the business were GST-registered. It purchases an international franchise licence for $10,000. As the value of the supplies made by the business is now $49,000, the business is required to register for GST. 13. Further details on registration requirements are in the Inland Revenue booklet GST ñ do you need to register? (IR 365), which is available on the Inland Revenue website ñ www.ird.govt.nz. 7 Related-party transactions 14. Charges for services from an associated overseas business can relate to a specific service or be incorporated into a larger sum. This may be the case, for example, within a group of companies or single multi-national company, when the parent company or head office may allocate a proportion of its costs to the various parts of the enterprise (referred to as a ìcost allocationî). 15. The reverse charge applies to a cost allocation by treating it, in the first instance, as a supply of services. 2 However, the reverse charge does not apply to any part of a cost allocation that relates to salary or wages, interest 3 and other exempt supplies. 4 For the purposes of the reverse charge, the ordinary meaning of ìsalaryî, rather than the meaning used for income tax purposes, applies. In the Concise Oxford Dictionary ìsalaryî means a ìfixed regular payment made Ö by an employer to an employeeî. 16. For the purposes of the reverse charge, a New Zealand entity or presence must be treated as separate from its offshore presence in relation to the ìimported servicesî. This means that a New Zealand branch of a non-resident company must be treated as a separate entity and supplies within a group of companies cannot be disregarded by applying the grouping rules. Example 5: Separate entities UK Co, a manufacturer/wholesale company, engages in an international advertising campaign. The campaign is developed and produced in the USA by a third party. The campaign, including advertising time around the world, costs $72 million. UK Co decides to allocate $9 million dollars of the cost to its New Zealand subsidiary UK (NZ) Co. The subsidiary in New Zealand records the cost allocation as an imported service in its GST return and pays GST of $1.125 million to Inland Revenue. 2 See section 8(4C). 3 See section 10(15C). 4 See section 8(4B)(c). US PR COMPANY UK Co (Parent) UK(NZ) Co (Wholly owned Sub.) Services £ 8 Example 6: Related-party financial services Aus Co, an insurance company, charges its New Zealand subsidiary $17 million for reinsurance of life insurance contracts. The supply of the reinsurance services would be an exempt supply of financial services if it were made in New Zealand. Therefore the supply is not subject to the reverse charge. Example 7: Intra-group supplies Aus Co, a large retail operation with outlets throughout Australia and New Zealand, maintains a branch in New Zealand to handle the consumer finance operations of Aus Co in New Zealand. To reflect accurately the costs incurred in Australia for providing backroom support to the New Zealand branch, Aus Co imposes an annual charge of $6 million on the New Zealand branch. Previously, this charge had been ignored for GST purposes. However, the New Zealand division is now required to record the amount of the annual charge as an imported service in its GST return, excluding any amounts representing salary and interest. 17. The value of related-party services subject to the reverse charge is reduced by the value of any salary or interest charges from any member of a non-resident companyís wholly owned group, or separate branches or divisions of the same company, that form part of a cost allocation. Example 8: Related-party transaction E is the offshore head office of a multinational company. F is the New Zealand branch of the multinational company. The companies supply financial services. E provides administrative, accounting and management services to F and to other branches in other countries. E recovers the cost of providing these services by making a cost allocation to each branch every year. F is debited with a cost allocation of $10 million. This covers administrative and management costs but, owing to the minor nature of the accounting services it receives from E, F is not allocated any accounting costs. Within the $10 million of administrative and management costs, there are the following cost components: Staff salaries: $5 million Financing (interest) costs: $1 million Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Total cost allocation $10 million A cost allocation is treated as a supply of services by a non-resident to a resident that would be taxable if made in New Zealand. F acquired the services other than for the sole purpose of making taxable supplies. E and F are treated as separate entities carrying on activities. Components of a cost allocation that are attributable to salaries and interest incurred by E are excluded from the value of the cost allocation subject to the reverse charge. Therefore only $4 million of the cost allocation is subject to the reverse charge. 9 The accounting services provided to F at no cost are a taxable supply acquired for non-taxable purposes. However, there is no uplift to market value, as the cost of the accounting services would have been allowed as an income tax deduction for F if it were a separate legal entity for the purposes of that Act. (See discussion of value of supply and example 13.) Therefore the amount subject to the reverse charge is: Staff salaries: 0 excluded Financing (interest) costs: 0 excluded Administration costs: $1.5 million Management costs: $2.5 million Accounting: 0 (no market value uplift required) Total subject to reverse charge: $4 million GST at 12.5% Total GST to be returned: $500,000 Mixed-use acquisitions 18. Although a person who acquires imported services is treated as having made the supply for the purposes of the reverse charge, that person is the recipient of the services for all other GST purposes, including input tax credit claims and change-in-use adjustments. This means that amounts paid by the recipient of imported services should not be taken into account for the purposes of: • the turnover method (see section 21A) in relation to change in use adjustments; or • determining whether a customer meets the 75 percent test (see sections 11A(1)(q) and (r)) in relation to zero-rating supplies of financial services. 19. A recipient of services subject to the reverse charge may be able to claim, under the general change-in-use adjustment rules, either an input tax credit based on their principal purpose or change-in-use adjustments 5 to reflect any taxable use of the imported services. 20. A person who has acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. The person, however, is required to make a change-in-use adjustment and return additional output tax to the extent that the services were not acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 21. A person who has not acquired imported services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is not entitled to an input tax credit for the GST paid under the reverse charge. That person may, however, under the change-in-use adjustment provisions, claim back the GST paid to the extent that the services were acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. 5 Either one-off or on-going. 10 22. In either instance, when input tax credits are available, a tax invoice is not required if the output tax on the relevant supply has been accounted for. Example 9: Mixed-use acquisition ñ principally exempt An offshore computer company provides computer programming services to a GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company for $1 million. Offshore Computer Company NZ Insurance Company NZ$1 million NZ Inland Revenue Computer Programming Services New ZealandOffshore NZ$125,000 GST Supplies of general insurance - taxable Supplies to non- businesses of life insurance - exempt Using a turnover approach, 70 percent of the services are used for making exempt supplies of life insurance, and 30 percent for making taxable supplies of general insurance. Under the reverse charge, the life insurance company is required, therefore, to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 imposed under the reverse charge in its GST return. The life insurance company is not entitled to an input tax credit in relation to the supply of the computer programming services because it has not acquired the services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Because the life insurance company uses 30 percent of the services for making taxable supplies, it is entitled to a change-in-use adjustment, and is able to make a period-by-period or annual deduction during the term of the asset from its output tax liability. The life insurance company does not, however, include the $1.125 million as a supply it has made for the purposes of making the adjustment based on turnover. Example 10: Mixed-use acquisition ñ principally (but not 95 percent) taxable A multinational shipping company supplies a software package to its GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary for $1 million. Using a turnover approach, 85 percent of the services are used for making taxable supplies and 15 percent for making exempt supplies. The reverse charge applies, as the services are acquired by a company which makes taxable supplies of less than 95 percent of total supplies. Under the reverse charge, the subsidiary is required to add GST to the $1 million, giving a figure of $1.125 million, and include the GST of $125,000 in its GST return. The subsidiary is, however, entitled to an input tax credit of $125,000, as the software was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It has the option to make a one-off, period-by-period or annual adjustment by way of output tax to reflect the extent of the exempt use of the software. 11 Zero-rating services consumed wholly outside New Zealand 23. The reverse charge applies only to services that cannot be regarded as being wholly consumed outside New Zealand. Services can be zero-rated if they are physically performed outside New Zealand. In most circumstances, services are physically performed at the time and place at which they are physically received. However, services which are intangible in nature and are performed offshore, such as a legal opinion or feasibility study, cannot be regarded as necessarily wholly consumed offshore. These services are not, therefore, treated as zero-rated services for the purposes of the reverse charge. Example 11: Zero-rating under the reverse charge A GST-registered New Zealand life insurance company sends an employee to Sydney to obtain a legal opinion from an Australian law firm in relation to a proposed transaction and pays for the employeeís accommodation in a Sydney hotel. The life insurance company makes predominantly exempt supplies of services. The life insurance company is charged $1 million for the legal services, which it pays on receipt of the services. An invoice is provided after payment is made. The life insurance company is charged $500 for the accommodation services, which the employee pays for using a business credit card. The life insurance company is not an associated person of either the law firm or hotel. In this situation: • The legal and the hotel services are supplied by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. • The legal and hotel services are acquired by a person who makes predominantly (more than 95 percent) exempt supplies. • The supply of the legal and hotel services would be a taxable supply if it were made in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of the personís taxable activity. The supplies are subject to the reverse charge. However, the supply of imported services may be zero-rated if the services are physically performed outside New Zealand and the nature of those services is such that they can be physically received only at the time and place at which the services are physically performed. Although it is arguable whether the supply of legal services is ìphysically receivedî when the employee receives the opinion, the nature of the legal services means that they could be physically received other than at the time and place at which they are physically performed. The New Zealand life insurer can receive the opinion at any time and place (including New Zealand). The supply of legal services cannot, therefore, be zero-rated and is subject to GST at 12.5% under the reverse charge, requiring the New Zealand life insurer to return $125,000. If the life insurer has acquired the legal services for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies of general insurance, the company is entitled to an input tax credit for the GST charged. The hotel accommodation services, on the other hand, can only ever be physically received where they are performed. Therefore these services can be zero-rated and the New Zealand life insurer is not required to return GST on the supply. 12 Time of supply rules 24. The normal time of supply rules generally apply for the purposes of the reverse charge. This means that the time of supply for the reverse charge is the earlier of when an invoice is issued or payment is made for the supply. If the supply is between associated persons, which might occur, for example, with head office charges, an invoice may not have been issued, or payment made, until, say, year end. To cater for these circumstances, the time of supply test for supplies between associated persons has been amended to allow application of the test to be deferred until the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipientís balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 25. The time of supply for a supply of services between associated parties subject to the reverse charge is, therefore, the earliest of: • when an invoice is issued; • when payment is made in respect of the supply; or • the end of the taxable period that includes the date which is two months after the recipientís balance date for the year in which the services were performed. 26. In the case of services supplied under an agreement that provides for periodic payments, the services are treated as being successively supplied, with each supply taking place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. Example 12: Time of supply A (offshore parent company) and B (New Zealand subsidiary) are parts of a multinational group. Throughout the year A supplies B with administrative and accounting services. B is registered for GST, accounts for GST on a two-monthly taxable period basis and makes solely exempt supplies. B is not required to pay for these services until after the end of each year, when a lump sum is charged for administrative and accounting services provided by the parent company to all members of the multinational group. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge as it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired by a business which makes taxable supplies amounting to less than 95 percent of total supplies. Bís balance date is 30 June, and the end of the taxable period that includes the date that is two months after Bís balance date is 31 August. The time of supply for the services is either: Invoice: If A provides B with invoices/an invoice for the services provided before either payment is made or 31 August, the time of supply for the service/services is when the invoice is issued. Payment: If B makes payment for the services before either the issue of invoices/an invoice for the supply/supplies or 31 August, the time of supply is when the payment/payments are made. Taxable period following balance date: If neither an invoice is issued, nor payment made, before 31 August, then the time of supply is 31 August. The supply is therefore required to be included in Bís GST return, due on 30 September. 13 Transitional provisions 27. Special time-of-supply rules 6 apply when a supply of imported services spans the introduction of the reverse charge. The rules are based on the transitional provision which applied on the introduction of GST to address situations when tax would be either chargeable on supplies received before the date of introduction of GST, or would not be chargeable on supplies received after the date of introduction of GST. 28. The new rules provide that a supply of services occurs at the time the services are performed, and they are treated as being performed continuously and uniformly during the whole of the period or periods over which the services are performed. 29. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied before the reverse charge came into effect, the services are not subject to GST. To the extent that services are treated as being supplied on or after the reverse charge came into effect, they are subject to GST, even if they were invoiced or paid for before the reverse charge came into effect. Value of supply 30. The value of a supply subject to the reverse charge will generally be equal to the consideration for the supply. This ensures that the supply is GST-exclusive in the same way as for imported goods. 31. Applying the normal rules for supplies between associated persons would mean that the value of the supply would be the greater of the actual consideration or the open market value of the supply. 32. To minimise compliance costs, however, the actual consideration will be treated as the correct value for a supply between associated parties in the following circumstances: • if the payment, or any payment that would be made, for the services is allowed as an income tax deduction to the recipient; or • if the supply is between separate branches or divisions of the same company and the payment for the services would be allowed as an income tax deduction to the recipient if the branch or division were entitled to income tax deductions, or would be if any payment were made. 6 See section 84B. 14 Example 13: Value of supply of services As part of an international advertising campaign for a multinational group, C (an offshore parent company) supplies D (a GST-registered New Zealand subsidiary that makes predominantly exempt supplies) with advertising services. As the advertising services are for a multinational group and most of the costs are absorbed and incurred in other countries in which the company operates, the New Zealand branch is not charged for the services, either explicitly or by way of a cost allocation from the head office. The supply of services is subject to the reverse charge because it is a supply that would be taxable in New Zealand and it is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Under the general time of supply rule, as C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the advertising services would have been an income tax deduction for company D. The value of the supply and the GST payable are, therefore, zero. Example 14: Value of supply of intangible property C electronically supplies a software licence to D for $200,000 but its market value could be considerably more. The licence is treated as a supply of services, and the supply is subject to the reverse charge as it would be taxable in New Zealand and is acquired other than for solely taxable purposes. Prima facie, because C and D are associated persons, D would have to calculate the market value of the services it has received. However, an uplift in the value of supply to market value is not required, as the cost of the software licence would have been allowed as a depreciation deduction for D. The value of the supply is, therefore, $200,000, and GST at 12.5% on this is $25,000. Documentation requirements 33. A recipient of a supply of imported services subject to the reverse charge is required to maintain sufficient records to establish the correct value on which GST should be charged. The following information is required for this purpose: • the name and address of the supplier; • the date on which, or the period during which, the supply was received; • a description of the services supplied; • the consideration for the supply; • the time by which payment of the consideration for the supply is due; and • the amount of the consideration for a supply that the taxpayer has treated as not affecting the value of the supply under section 10(15C)(a) and (b) (that is, salary and interest). 7 34. An invoice or other supporting documentation, such as a supply contract or record of payments made, may substantiate the valuations adopted for the purposes of the reverse charge. 7 See section 24B. 15 35. An invoice is not required in order to claim input tax credits in respect of the imported services if output tax has been paid on the supply. 8 36. Adequate information from the related head office or related entity is needed to ascertain the correct value of staff salaries and interest to be excluded from internal charges subject to the reverse charge. Charges between associated persons 37. Charges for services supplied between associated persons are valued at cost if payment is allowed as an income tax deduction. In other circumstances, the value of the supply is its market value. In determining market value, Inland Revenue will accept charges calculated and evaluated in accordance with the income tax transfer pricing guidelines. 38. There is no explicit statutory requirement to prepare and maintain transfer pricing documentation, but it should be adequate to ensure that a person is able to demonstrate readily to Inland Revenue that its prices are consistent with the armís length principle in section GD 13 of the Income Tax Act. The armís length charge is one that is consistent with what would have been charged and accepted in a transaction between independent enterprises in comparable circumstances. 39. Even so, taxpayers are not expected to prepare levels of documentation that are disproportionate to the amount of tax revenue at risk in their transactions. The cost of preparing documentation should be weighed against the risk that Inland Revenue will make a pricing adjustment. 40. Inland Revenue would expect to see, at a minimum, the following documentation: • an identification of the cross-border transactions for which the taxpayer has a pricing exposure; • a broad functional analysis of the taxpayerís operations, to identify the critical functions being performed; • an estimation of the business risk of not undertaking and documenting a more detailed pricing analysis; • an estimation of the costs of complying with the rules and guidelines. 41. A taxpayer should also, as far as practicable, seek to collect and retain documentation that is: • existing at the time the taxpayer was developing or implementing any arrangement that might raise pricing issues, or • brought into existence close to the time the transaction occurs. 8 See section 20(2)(d). 16 42. Such documentation might include books, records, studies, analyses, conclusions and any other written or electronic material recording information that may be relevant in the determination of transfer prices. 43. The transfer pricing guidelines are appended to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000). This document is also available on the internet.

Towards Consensus on the Taxation of Investment Income Report to the Minister of Finance and Revenue By Craig Stobo Chair October 2004 SEMI-KIWI The barn roof needs painting and the spouting is ruined. Likewise the roof of this house in which we live, borer here, rot there. I’m neither handy, in the great Kiwi DIY tradition, nor monied, which rather leaves us up shit creek without a shovel. I grub to find what Stevens called the ‘plain sense of things’ and come up empty-handed more often than not, but I’m a dab-hand at recognising, if not suppressing, self-pity, and I can back a trailer expertly, so all is not lost. Brian Turner Te Mata Estate New Zealand Poet Laureate (Reprinted from “Taking Off”, Victoria University Press, 2001, with kind permission of the author) Contents Foreword Chapter 1 Executive summary 1 Chapter 2 Taxation of investment income – principles and practice 2 Chapter 3 The impact of the current tax boundaries 7 Chapter 4 Options for reform 14 Chapter 5 Stakeholder reaction 24 Chapter 6 My view of the options and recommendations for change 28 Chapter 7 Next steps 34 Appendix I Terms of Reference 35 Appendix II Stakeholders consulted 37 Appendix III “Financial systems and economic growth: An evaluation framework for policy” – a summary 38 Appendix IV Background to the tax rules for CIVs 41 Appendix V Working for Families – effective marginal tax rates, and abatements 45 Glossary 47 Foreword I consulted a large number of stakeholders during this consensus building process. They represented a range of interests reflecting the breadth of the investment and savings industry in New Zealand. The basis for my engagement was not that New Zealand necessarily has a poor savings rate, but that taxation is distorting the efficient allocation of what savings New Zealanders do have. Taxation rules are necessarily arbitrary, but in the case of the taxation of investment income, outcomes have become sub-optimal, in my judgment, as after-tax return considerations mean investors incur transactions costs and assume different portfolio risks than would be the case if investors focused on gross (pre-tax) returns. The optimal allocation of our scarce capital resources is therefore distorted and New Zealand’s potential growth rate is arguably lower as a result. The options developed in this process were designed to reduce both the tax disincentives prevalent in New Zealand collective investment vehicles (CIVs), relative to direct investment in New Zealand assets; and the distortions created by our tax rules favouring a small number of high tax countries (the grey list) for international portfolio investment in equity. This process did not seek a constituency to support tax incentives for savings. In my capacity as Chair I was assisted by David Carrigan, Darshana Elwela, Tracey Davies, Keith Taylor and Robin Oliver from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue; and Brock Jera, Felicity Barker, David Snell, Andrew McLoughlin, and Vicky Robertson from the Treasury. I want to personally thank them for their support and intellectual integrity during the consultation process. Thanks are also due to the stakeholders who put aside their self interest, and contributed their time to wrestle with the issues and the proposed solutions. I hope I have adequately captured their concerns and aspirations. I should not neglect the fact that the options presented in this review build on the generation and exchange of ideas of past contributors to the improvement of public policy on the taxation of investment income. If I have misrepresented any of their views I take full responsibility.

He contributed to the Periodic Report Group, Savings New Zealand and the officials’ issues paper, Taxation of non-controlled offshore investment in equity. He has worked as an independent contractor for this consensus building process. He has financial interests in direct shares, direct property and CIVs. 1 Chapter 1 Executive summary The Government has asked me to “develop options for change that would minimise the extent to which the tax system distorts the way New Zealanders invest (direct versus via an intermediary or via different intermediaries)”. The Terms of Reference (see Appendix I) restricted the development of options to all offshore portfolio equity investment, whether direct or through a New Zealand collective investment vehicle (CIV), and New Zealand CIVs that own domestic equity. It did not extend to the treatment of debt instruments or New Zealand equity/property held directly. This consultation process uncovered a strong consensus to change the way New Zealand taxes investment income. Therefore the objective of this process was welcomed by almost all stakeholders. Stakeholders agreed on the tax boundaries under discussion and the economic distortions that arise from those boundaries, which affect investor behaviour. Options presented for improving the taxation treatment of investment income in New Zealand were agreed by stakeholders as the best set of options available, given my Terms of Reference. I did not receive any comments or submissions that materially improved the options presented. Options provided to me on flattening the tax scale and extending the brief to direct New Zealand assets are economically sound suggestions but are outside the Terms of Reference. An analysis of stakeholders’ preferred combination of options shows majority support for: a) A change in the definition of “income” for defined New Zealand CIVs by shifting the capital/revenue boundary to exclude capital gains on domestic equity. b) The abolition of the grey list and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for offshore portfolio equity investment, the removal of dividend taxation, and the institution of an investment and savings tax (IST). c) The alignment of taxation through a New Zealand CIV with investor marginal tax rates by way of a “flow through” regime. An analysis of this consensus and my Terms of Reference, which demand consistency, leads me to differ on the combination of options preferred by stakeholders. My preference is for an IST to extend to domestic equity held through New Zealand CIVs, since this gets us closer to the taxation of full economic income and is consistent with the preferred option for taxation of offshore equity. I believe there is considerable momentum for change. It is not obvious to me that a democratic process of consensus building towards an improved sustainable system of taxation of investment income for New Zealand investors during a clear window of goodwill can be surpassed as a strong process for change. 2 Chapter 2 Taxation of investment income – principles and practice In the course of the consultation process it became clear that sections of the investment community sought clarification on what it was I was trying to solve. I hope the following articulates the issues clearly. THE TAXATION OF INVESTMENT INCOME The guiding principle of income tax policy is to tax an economic definition of income. The most common definition of income, attributable to Haig-Simons, 1 is the change in market value of net assets for a defined period plus consumption over the same period. Deviations from this principle would result in some economic activities being preferred relative to others. Haig-Simons income is therefore the benchmark which I have used to assess options for taxing investment income in New Zealand. Unrealised capital gains on net assets under this benchmark are part of economic income. New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. 2 That is not to say that capital gains taxes are a preferred way of dealing with this anomaly. The McLeod Review concluded in 2001 that “... New Zealand should not adopt a general realisation-based capital gains tax. We \[the Review\] believe that such a tax would not necessarily make our tax system fairer and more efficient, would not lower tax avoidance and would not raise substantial revenue that could be used to lower tax rates. Instead, any such tax would be more likely to increase the complexity and costs of our system. The experience of other countries (such as Australia, the UK and the US) supports that conclusion.” 3 New Zealand has instead opted for business and purpose tests to define whether investment is on revenue account, and therefore subject to tax on realised gains, or on capital account, in which case taxation is not due on realised gains. The tests effectively try to distinguish between what is the apple tree (untaxed capital) and what is the apple (taxable income). 1 Haig, Robert M. (editor) (1921), The Federal Income Tax, Columbia University Press, and Simons, Henry C. (1938), Personal Income Taxation, University of Chicago Press. 2 While capital gains are tax-free in the main, New Zealand deems the proceeds of sale from certain assets to be income under ordinary concepts. 3 Final Report of the Tax Review 2001 (October 2001). 3 The tests cannot fully be described in legislation. They do, however, have a long history in the common law. Recently, participants in the investment and savings industry have had to resort to the judiciary to seek clarity. An example of this guidance is Alexander and Alexander Pension Plan v CIR. 4 Additional common law guidance comes from CIR v City Motor Services 5 and Grieve v CIR. 6 None provide watertight definitions of what is capital and what is revenue. The problems drawing the boundary between capital and revenue were summed up eloquently as “... an intellectual minefield in which the principles are elusive and the analogies treacherous”. 7 The major tax-driven side effects from New Zealand’s deviation from the taxation of economic income are: • Investors’, suppliers’ and advisors’ efforts to mitigate tax liabilities require expensive tax advice on whether an investment is on capital or revenue account. • Compliance outcomes are asymmetric. Trustees of CIVs with tax liabilities will tend to be conservative in their definition of income by treating both realised and unrealised gains on revenue account. This is due to equity issues associated with pooling and the threat of official audit. Other investors may “game” the definition and not treat realised gains as income because the threat of official audit is perceived as low. • Taxpayers can apply to the Inland Revenue for private rulings on whether an investment is on capital or revenue account in order to gain certainty of tax treatment. However, these rulings are expensive and time consuming. • Inland Revenue rulings on the interpretation of the capital/revenue boundary in relation to passive products have also created a tax driven demand for passive products, which has led to over-investment. This means that companies within relevant indices may be receiving more capital than is warranted, while others outside these indices go wanting. • Investors may have a strong preference to own directly high dividend New Zealand shares, and a bias away from directly owned high dividend shares offshore. Investments offshore may be directed to growth oriented companies to minimise double taxation due to their inability to utilise offshore imputation credits. 4 (1995) 19 TRNZ 884 5 \[1969\] NZLR 1010 (CA) 6 (1983) 6 NZTC 61,682 7 Tucker v Granada Motorway Services Ltd \[1979\] 2 All ER 801; per Templeman J. 4 • Traditional CIVs migrate to entity forms which replicate the status of direct investors on capital account such as individually managed accounts, blind trusts and passive funds, even though the spread of underlying assets may be equivalent to assets held by more traditional CIVs. While these newer forms may well have platform technology and client servicing advantages, and competitive fee structures, it would be a long bow to pull to say that the absence of a tax on realised gains is not the principal competitive advantage. The consequences of this shift in form is that compliance obligations are pushed down to the beneficial investors; and it is not clear that these forms are optimal channels for lower income savers with small initial balances. If they are pooling funds (reducing risk and administration costs), then they must have robust systems of individual investor identification to ensure they do not meet the definition of “unit trust” in the Income Tax Act. THE TAXATION OF OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT IN EQUITY The taxation treatment of offshore portfolio investment in equity must necessarily differ from the taxation treatment of onshore portfolio investment, because the New Zealand Government does not collect taxation from foreign entities, whereas it does collect taxes from New Zealand entities (e.g. company taxation). New Zealand investors should regard foreign taxes as simply a cost of investing overseas and arrange their portfolios to minimise offshore tax accordingly. The New Zealand Government should be indifferent to capital outflows when New Zealand investors face an after-tax foreign return that is at least as high as a pretax domestic return on similar risk-adjusted assets. National welfare is enhanced as a result. As a net capital importing country, New Zealand should implement this “residence principle”-based taxation strategy. New Zealand residents should be taxed at the same rate of New Zealand tax on all sources of domestic and foreign income, recognising foreign taxes as a cost of doing business by allowing them to be deductible. Ideally therefore New Zealand tax rules should approximate the after- foreign tax income earned by the foreign entity and attribute it to the New Zealand investor. Currently the New Zealand tax rules deviate from this principle. Two sets of rules apply to offshore portfolio investment. Non-grey list countries are subject to the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. These rules generally apply the residence principle by taxing, on an accrued basis, the investor’s economic income derived from the foreign entity. They therefore get fairly close to Haig-Simons income. However, the four income calculations available to FIF investors are costly to comply with, have harsh cashflow consequences in certain circumstances and have timing disadvantages. 5 The grey list refers to investment in seven countries – Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Norway, the United States, Germany and Japan – which, because of the similarity of their tax systems to that of New Zealand, have achieved a concessionary treatment resulting in a tax preference for New Zealand investors. Grey list non- business investors (who generally argue that they invest on capital account) are generally only required to pay New Zealand tax on dividend income. It is therefore not surprising to learn that around 80% of offshore portfolio investment occurs in grey list countries. From an economic perspective, quite why any of these investment destinations (least of all Norway) should receive tax preferences over non-grey list destinations such as France or China is illogical. The current country composition is economically meaningless. Our tax rules should encourage New Zealand investors to focus their foreign portfolio decisions on income net of foreign tax paid, relative to gross returns available from portfolio investments onshore. Furthermore, effective tax rates (on economic income earned by New Zealanders after foreign tax) can diverge significantly from an equivalent pre-tax domestic investment. THE TAXATION OF ENTITIES Entities, or more specifically CIVs, such as investment companies, unit trusts and superannuation schemes are economic agents of their owners. Entity taxation is economically a tax on the beneficial owners of entities. After all, entities do not derive economic income – their beneficial owners do. Entity taxation should therefore reflect the marginal income tax rate of the ultimate investor. In New Zealand the corporate tax regime places a single withholding tax on the company on behalf of the ultimate investors. Our imputation regime provides a mechanism to align our progressive income tax rate scale with the withholding tax levied in the entity. The more progressive the income tax scale becomes, however, the more advantages accrue to taxpayers on higher marginal tax rates (in terms of timing of final tax payments); and the more disadvantages accrue to those on lower marginal tax rates (in terms of timing and potential use of excess imputation credits). With regard to New Zealand CIVs such as superannuation schemes, where the final 33% tax liability resides inside the vehicle (and therefore there is no imputation regime) there is no alignment with taxpayers on 19.5% or 39% marginal tax rates. Investors on 19.5% face tax penalties while those on 39% receive a tax incentive. It is difficult to find evidence that differences between entity and marginal tax rates drive investor behaviour. The anecdotal evidence suggests 39% investors prefer direct investment (due to the treatment of capital gains). Investors on 19.5%, however, not only find it difficult to save, face the same capital gains hurdle, but also face the additional hurdle of over-taxation in the entity. (The interaction of the tax system with the benefit regime is important. See Appendix V.) Furthermore, tax- exempt entities, such as charities, find it very difficult to align their tax status with the taxation of CIVs. 6 The tax treatment of CIVs that potentially hold the same underlying assets should be equivalent. Currently taxation regimes differ for unit trusts, GIFs, life products and superannuation (see Appendix IV). This is not efficient when the vehicles may hold exactly the same assets. Real economic costs are incurred by the ultimate saver or investor as they or their advisors search for and select the most tax effective entity. 7 Chapter 3 The impact of the current tax boundaries THE DEFINITION OF “INCOME” The capital/revenue boundary receives a conservative treatment by almost all New Zealand CIVs. As a result almost all CIVs provide for tax on realised and unrealised capital gains at 33%, despite the absence of a legislated capital gains tax in New Zealand. The principal reason for this is that, in the absence of clear legislation or judicial rulings on the business and purpose tests, trustees opt to treat all gains on revenue account. To do otherwise could introduce inter-temporal inequity between classes of investors should the Inland Revenue be successful in challenging a capital account tax treatment. Those investors that exited prior to the successful challenge would escape any tax liability. As noted in the previous chapter, the economic impact of this boundary is threefold. Firstly, the treatment of capital gains inside CIVs is a major turnoff to all investors who have the opportunity to invest directly in the same underlying assets on capital account. Secondly, the direct channel is not easily accessible to investors with small initial balances and small amounts of regular savings. Thirdly, the direct channel clearly favours investors with existing accumulated capital. Figure 1 illustrates why direct investment in a New Zealand share is preferable for a 39% investor on capital account relative to investing in the same share through a unit trust. Figure 1: Direct/indirect investment boundary NZ Investor 39 % C/A $100K $100K $10K TCG $6.7K+$3.3K ICs NZ Unit Trust R/A NZ Co INVESTMENT VIA A UNIT TRUST Dividend of $10K = $6.1K in pocket KEY IC – imputation credits TCG – taxable capital gain C/A – capital a/c NTCG – non-taxable capital gain R/A – revenue a/c 8 In addition, there has been a rapid increase in investor interest in the provision of investment management services on capital account which effectively push the liability for tax to the investor. These new services include individually managed accounts, blind trusts and passive funds with Inland Revenue rulings. In relation to passive funds, their tax-favourable investment has seen a rapid growth in their popularity from 1996 (the year that the first Inland Revenue ruling was granted). There is now estimated to be around $5.5 billion in passive funds. 8 Tax is creating a wedge against the use of pooled investment services, which have become relatively tax-disadvantaged. I do not want to belittle the real advantages that these innovations may provide in terms of service, choice, fees, and investment performance. However, tax is clearly a major competitive advantage, and the ability of the Inland Revenue to monitor the end investor’s compliance with the tax rules is weak.

The migration may be driven by other factors such as economies of scale, but the tax advantages are too large to ignore. This migration to foreign CIVs may not be optimal from a New Zealand portfolio investor’s perspective. Firstly, foreign CIVs may not manage currency risk from a New Zealand perspective. Secondly, their world view is not New Zealand-domiciled, so an international equities portfolio managed principally for Australian investors will not include Australian stocks but may include New Zealand stocks. From the Government’s perspective, compliance shifts from New Zealand entities to New Zealand individuals.

Individuals hold another $5.5 billion, of which approximately 60% is either invested directly in Australia or using an Australian entity as a vehicle to invest elsewhere. The first impact of the preferential tax treatment attached to the grey list is that 80% of New Zealanders’ portfolio investment goes into grey list countries, a rationale for which is evidenced in figure 3. This statistic is not necessarily very helpful and will almost certainly be lower, since in many cases New Zealand portfolio investment into grey list countries includes intermediate vehicles such as Australian unit trusts and UK open-ended investment companies which on-invest globally, including into non- grey list stocks. Available data cannot assist officials to look through the intermediate vehicles to the final investment to determine the actual country exposure of our total portfolio investment. However, it is interesting to note that the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) benchmark country weighting of the seven grey list countries was 83.6% as at 31 August 2004. Figure 3: Grey list/non-grey list boundary 10 Taxation of non-controlled offshore investment in equity: an officials’ issues paper on suggested legislative amendments.

The original rationale for the grey list (that effective grey list tax rates approximate New Zealand effective tax rates) has broken down. The soon-to-be introduced rules relating to offshore unit trusts will remove the ability of some offshore vehicles to avoid income tax by issuing bonus units in lieu of distributions. However, the ability to avoid the FIF rules remains because offshore vehicles can still be used as conduits for New Zealanders to access non-grey list investment destinations. I do not understand why New Zealanders should be discouraged from investing in low tax countries (which is the result of the grey list bias). Foreign taxes are a cost of investing, just as labour costs are a cost of that company doing business. There is no welfare gain for New Zealand households or the Government by encouraging New Zealanders to invest in high tax regimes (which is what the grey list represents). Thirdly, through an act of serendipity, foreign conduit vehicles in the grey list provide opportunities for New Zealand investors to access global stocks on capital account, and avoid the FIF rules. Do we honestly think that these CIVs are the best in the world? And why should they be preferred to CIVs that may be prevalent in non-grey list countries? THE TAXATION OF CIVS There are effectively two boundaries in this area, namely the boundaries amongst CIVs that potentially hold the same assets, and the boundary between the taxation regime applicable in CIVs and that prevailing for the individual. The net effect is that investors who are committed to using CIVs can be expected, a priori, to choose vehicles based on their effective tax rate, despite underlying assets being the same in each case. Figure 4 illustrates that it is rational for committed CIV investors on 39% tax rates to use superannuation schemes and insurance products as their preferred savings vehicle, while 19.5% taxpayers should use unit trusts, other things being equal. 13 Figure 4: Vehicle/marginal tax rate boundary The evidence to support this behavioural expectation is anecdotal. However, the evidence, such as it is, would suggest that (counter intuitively) a reasonable proportion of savers are 19.5% taxpayers. Perhaps other reasons, such as employer contributions, may be driving this behaviour. As far as I am aware, no public data is collected on the marginal rates of investors using different CIVs. SUMMARY It is clear to me that tax is driving investment behaviour. This adds to transition costs in that, as Appendix III (a summary of a recent Treasury working paper) discusses, the resulting misallocation of resources may be contributing to a lowering of our potential economic growth rate. $100K $100K $10K TCG $6.7K+3.3K ICs NZ Investor 39% C/A NZ Unit Trust R/A NZ Co INVESTMENT VIA A UNIT TRUST Dividend of $10K – 6% claw back = $6.1K in pocket $100K $100K $10K TCG $6.7K NZ Investor 39% C/A NZ Super Fund R/A NZ Co INVESTMENT VIA A SUPER FUND No claw-back on distribution = $6.7k in pocket 14 Chapter 4 Options for reform SYSTEMIC THINKING When approaching the options I was very conscious of the need to apply synthesis thinking to understand the “system” under examination, the rules for taxing investment income. A “system” is a “whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without loss of its essential properties or functions”, 11 hence the illustration on the cover page. If we were to try to improve one part of the system, as officials attempted to do with the issues paper issued last year to address the taxation of non- controlled foreign equity, the performance of the whole system may not be improved. This is because in a modern deregulated economy, capital is mobile across boundaries. I do acknowledge that a weakness in my brief from the Minister is the exclusion from examination of the taxation of income from New Zealand assets where the investor does not use a CIV. However, the addition of domestic assets held by CIVs to offshore portfolio investment to the reform agenda is an improvement in holistic thinking. Additionally, if the options provide flexibility for further sensible reform then we have an improved outcome. What is most important is that I attempt to move beyond simply an optimal solution under current thinking, to a different conceptual framework where the problems can be eliminated and the taxation regime can get closer to the principles outlined earlier. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES The advantages and disadvantages of the various options should be read in light of the objective of the consultative process, namely “the minimisation of the extent to which the tax system distorts the way New Zealanders invest (direct versus via an intermediary or via different intermediaries)”. The intention of the Terms of Reference was to limit the scope for reform to offshore portfolio equity (directly held and through CIVs) and CIVs holding domestic portfolio equity. The options therefore do not consider domestic portfolio equity held directly. Some options reduce the distortions outlined in Chapter 3 but do not eliminate them. My preference is to aim for greater simplicity at the expense of accuracy when this tradeoff is confronted. 11 Recreating the Corporation, Russell L Ackoff, Emeritus, Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, 1999. 15 THE OPTIONS Income Calculation Vehicle/Marginal Tax 1. Tax in the CIV (a) Tax on managed fund vehicle with credit for tax paid (b) Final tax at variable rates Onshore CIVs only (a) IST (b) Shift capital/revenue boundary 2. Flow through (a) Withholding tax at proxy rate deducted and paid at source with investor wash up (b) Withholding at variable rates deducted and paid at source Offshore CIVs and offshore direct equities only (a) IST (b) Comparative Value Not applicable NZ assets held dir ectly – outside scope The matrix above was constructed by officials when they were responding to my requirement for a simple, integrated flipchart presentation of the options available to mitigate the tax boundaries detailed in Chapter 3. The matrix elegantly integrates potential solutions to the three relevant problematic tax boundaries, namely, capital/revenue, offshore/onshore, and CIV tax rates/investors’ marginal tax rates; and of course the boundaries overall relationship with direct New Zealand assets, which lies outside my Terms of Reference. My sphere of influence was to reduce the distortionary tax treatment of everything inside the matrix. Before reviewing the options available I want to articulate a prospective definition of a CIV. WHAT SHOULD CONSTITUTE A CIV? For the purposes of the consensus building process I have come to the conclusion that the definition of a CIV should be a vehicle that owns a portfolio of securities where that entity owns no more than 10% of the issued capital of the underlying company and has no control over the company, and where each individual owner of the vehicle owns no more than 10% of it. Ten percent is an appropriate boundary as it is an internationally accepted distinction between portfolio and non-portfolio investment. In addition, a business activity test should be developed in order to ensure that a vehicle’s main function was managing investments. This means that unit trusts, defined contribution superannuation schemes, GIFs, and life insurers’ savings and annuity products should be included within the CIV definition. 16 Closely held entities (such as some partnerships and some venture capital funds) would not come within the proposed definition because of avoidance concerns. Furthermore, where the current benefit of the investment is not directly linked to the current market value of the CIV’s underlying assets, or where there is no accurate surrender value such as for certain life policies or defined benefit superannuation schemes, these would not fall within the definition. The reason is that these vehicles cannot equitably assign income to each beneficiary. DEFINITION OF INCOME FOR ONSHORE ASSETS The options are either an Investment and Savings Tax (IST) 12 or a shift in the capital/revenue boundary, to the point where capital gains on equity are tax-free and tax is paid on all other forms of income (e.g. rent/interest/dividends). Investment and Savings Tax (IST) This title is a simple umbrella term for the variants of the risk free return method (RFRM) proposed over the last four years in New Zealand – the real RFRM, the nominal RFRM method and the standard return method. Each variant has similar features. Essentially, at the beginning of each tax year, a universal rate of return on a portfolio of assets is assumed (i.e. ex ante). Taxable income is calculated by applying that rate of return to the dollar value of the portfolio at the commencement of the tax year. The tax due on that income is based on an investor’s marginal tax rate and is paid at the end of the tax year. Returns above the assumed rate are tax-free; returns below the assumed return still require payment of the tax. The relevant formula is provided below: Opening value \* assumed rate of return \* investor’s marginal tax rate Depending on the method chosen, an IST moves our taxation regime closer to the principle of taxing full economic income. If returns to risk are considered to be entirely random, given a level of risk, then the Government should be indifferent between obtaining a share of positive returns to risk and returning a share of losses from risk to taxpayers. The essentially random nature of these returns would suggest that Government is in no better position after the tax compared with the position before the tax. The Government could capture the expected value of a positive return to participation in financial markets by directly investing in equity. Assuming the Government does not want to hold equity directly, the average portion of positive return that the Government will collect over time would depend on the IST benchmark used. Whether a tax approach based on this logic meets the objective of taxing (on average) full economic income would depend critically on the rate. The IST rate that would 12 My thanks to Louis Boulanger for conceiving this title. 17 get us closest to taxing full economic income would be one that proxied expected average dividend yield plus capital gain. An IST represents a shift from traditional transaction-based taxes applied ex post, such as a typical capital gains tax, where the Government and the investor are exposed to the full volatility of equity cycles, to an ex ante tax on a low “risk free” rate, where the investor collects all capital gains above the risk free rate, in return for which the investor pays the tax through all equity cycles. The Government’s taxation revenue exposure shifts from an equity-like profile to one that has a profile closer to debt, in which case revenue volatility is reduced. An IST removes the uncertainty of the capital/revenue boundary – since the definition of what is capital and what is revenue is redundant. It replaces dividend taxation. The potential for error when estimating provisional tax reduces under an IST. Tax losses are no longer generated. IST liabilities would be reduced to the extent that imputation credits are available from portfolio investments. In terms of whether an IST gets us closer to the after-tax treatment of direct portfolio investment on capital account, it may, depending on the IST rate. In the short term there may be mismatches. However, while an IST may move the income tax treatment of CIVs closer to the income tax treatment of direct investments, it will not be equivalent. Direct investors on capital account will be indifferent between the two regimes if the ex post tax on their underlying portfolio’s dividend yield is the same as the ex ante IST on income from a CIV. Direct investors on revenue account should have a schizophrenic response. When ex post returns are higher than the IST rate, they should prefer to use a CIV; when total returns are negative they should prefer the status quo since they can claim a tax credit for capital losses. However, in both cases revenue account investors cannot predict ex post market returns. Alternative IST rate setting methodologies A higher IST based on expected dividend yield and capital gains will be closer to a tax on full economic income. A lower IST will be closer to the tax treatment of direct New Zealand equities. I have considered the following three methods: • Real risk free return method. The McLeod Review proposed a single risk-free rate of return applicable to all investments in the ambit of the regime. The rate would be based on New Zealand Government debt with a one-year term to maturity, adjusted for expected inflation over the year in question. This methodology is transparent and is credible because it is linked to deep liquid markets. 18 • Nominal risk free return method. This replicates the first method, but does not adjust for inflation, on the basis that our existing income tax system is largely not inflation-adjusted. • The standard return method. This method, which is nominally-based, would be set by Government fiat. Officials have suggested referencing the standard return rate to New Zealand dividend yields. The rate setting methodology is simple but less transparent. The Netherlands Government has introduced an IST (known as an “investment yield tax”) set at 4% on net assets. I do not know whether the real risk free return method or the nominal risk free return method get us closer to the taxation of full economic income. This is because it is unclear whether one-year Government bond yields (adjusted for inflation) equate to expected dividend yields and capital gains (also adjusted for inflation). The standard return method appears to gets us closer to the taxation treatment of direct New Zealand equity. Other IST issues • Opening market value/base value. The IST should be applied by multiplying an income tax rate by the IST assumed rate based on the asset value of an investor’s portfolio prevailing at the commencement of the tax year. This presumes a readily identifiable market value for relevant assets, where pricing is not discontinuous. • Part-year adjustments. Considerable work has already been undertaken by officials to resolve the issue of applying an IST regime to capital contributions and withdrawals over the course of an income year. I am not satisfied that this work has yet reached a degree of simplicity required for successful implementation of an IST regime. I am confident that a simple solution could be found. • IST cash flow mismatches. Inevitably, at some stage, market circumstances will dictate that IST liabilities will exceed actual income during a tax year. This is analogous to a New Zealand direct investor on capital account who always pays tax on dividends despite fluctuating share prices; or the payment of tax on rental income despite fluctuating house prices. In both cases effective tax rates will vary according to actual returns. CIVs will be required either to maintain cash or income assets to prudently cover this known liability, or to sell assets. This is easily conceived while the tax liability rests with the CIV. When the liability is pushed out to beneficial investors under the flow through option a “unit sell- down authority” mechanism will be required to facilitate the payment of tax, since there is no cash flow 19 • Compliance costs. The introduction of an IST means CIV tax accounting teams will be required to take into account an IST regime. However, the need to account for tax on dividend and capital gains would cease. Shifting the capital/revenue boundary This option proposes a shift in the capital/revenue boundary to the point where tax is not paid on capital gains on New Zealand equity but remains on all other forms income (rents, interest, dividends, etc). A shift such as this would be equivalent to the tax treatment of direct investment on capital account. The capital/revenue boundary would become well defined, eliminating uncertainty. The potential for estimation errors for provisional tax is reduced, but not to the same extent as under an IST. Tax losses in the CIV are eliminated. Accounting for capital gains taxation on domestic equity is removed. Inland Revenue rulings on passive funds would be redundant. This option gets us closer to the prevailing tax treatment of direct equity investment on capital account. A major weakness is that it does not get us closer to taxing full economic income, and is less consistent with either option presented for the taxation of portfolio investment from offshore. Where retail CIVs interpose intermediate wholesale CIVs for their equity investment, an issue arises on how to distinguish between the capital gains component and the taxable income component when all that the retail CIV receives is a single gross unit price. This would need to be resolved. Common issues Both options presented create a “brightline”, since the uncertainty over the capital/revenue boundary is either shifted and legislated, or eliminated. Transaction costs for providers and investors are reduced, and because tax liability is clear, the Inland Revenue can become more effective in monitoring compliance. Income tax liabilities would be reduced to the extent that domestic imputation credits and credits for foreign non-resident withholding tax are available from portfolio investments. Under both options expenses would continue to be deductible according to current tax rules. All options eliminate uncertainty over the definition of “income” for onshore equity. Income under either definition can be taxed in the CIV (option 1(a) or 1(b)) or flowed-through and taxed to the beneficial investors (under 2(a) or 2(b)). All options require an identification of what constitutes a CIV in order to protect investors using a CIV with a “safe harbour”. This safe harbour ensures that the actions of the CIV do not taint the capital/revenue status of the beneficial investor. However, if the investor’s activity or purpose in investing in a CIV so determines, the investment may be on revenue account. 20 TAXATION OF INCOME FROM OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO EQUITY There are two options to tax income from offshore portfolio equity. These options would apply to offshore investments through CIVs (New Zealand domiciled and overseas) and to offshore assets held directly. The options presume that the current grey list disappears for portfolio equity, which means that New Zealand investors can switch from high tax to low tax jurisdictions without a change in tax treatment. It is important to note that as the New Zealand Government cannot tax a foreign entity on its non-New Zealand sourced income, it must tax New Zealand investors as a proxy for the foreign entity. Because New Zealand investors and their advisors have the capability to reduce taxable income by exploiting the capital/revenue boundary in respect of offshore assets, and because the compliance and monitoring costs of looking through foreign structures to the final investment is prohibitive, it makes sense to tax full economic income. In addition, deferral opportunities make it sensible to tax this income on an accrued basis. Regardless of the options, a New Zealand CIV which holds foreign portfolio assets and has flow through tax treatment may be less attractive to some New Zealand investors who might enjoy some timing advantages from holding the same underlying foreign portfolio assets directly or in a foreign CIV (the timing advantage relates to the deferral in filing a tax return). The quid pro quo is the compliance costs associated with filing tax returns. Both options apply to all foreign CIVs regardless of the underlying assets. If those assets are, for example, global fixed income assets the accrual rules will not apply, as at present. It is difficult to say whether that would create a greater investor preference for CIVs taxed under these options relative to existing grey list arrangements. Investment and Savings Tax (IST) The prospective features and principles of an IST offshore are similar to an IST on domestic assets. Credits for foreign non-resident withholding taxes would be available but not credits for underlying foreign tax paid by the entity. While all three rate setting methodologies are available for an IST on offshore equities, they have a different starting point. The real RFRM would be based on global Government debt (adjusted for expected inflation over the coming year). The rationale for the difference is that the investment is in foreign assets. Where global Government debt is hedged back to New Zealand dollars, the currency gains are taxed under the accrual rules and parity reigns. The nominal RFRM rate replicates this but does not adjust for inflation. The standard return method using a global dividend benchmark is further away from taxing full economic income, and there are issues around the selection of the appropriate dividend yield (e.g. US, global?). It is not obvious that this benchmark is consistent with any other tax boundary. 21 Compliance costs rest with the New Zealand investor, whether it is a CIV, other entity or an individual. I do not believe compliance costs will change much since, in most instances, the requirement for filing tax returns to account for dividends will be replaced by an IST return. Risks associated with incorrectly calculating one’s tax liability must diminish since capital/revenue boundary issues disappear. There is a clear tension between the convergence of this option with the domestic IST option, and the divergence from the remaining FIF regime for foreign assets where ownership is greater than 10% but does not represent a controlling interest. Comparative value This option is based on one of the existing four income calculation methods available under the FIF rules. 13 It does attempt to tax full economic income. The change in the market value of offshore portfolio assets and any distributions are deemed to be income (or losses) for the year and are taxed. The officials’ issues paper suggested taxing 70% of the change in asset value in the year. This method, when combined with removing the grey list, was broadly revenue neutral. Credits for foreign non- resident withholding taxes would be available but not credits for underlying foreign tax paid by the entity. This option can also create potential cashflow complications, since exchange rate fluctuations mean taxable income can vary from actual income. I do not have any reasonable economic rationale for suggesting that 70% or any other rate is appropriate. This option is more consistent with the FIF regime prevailing for New Zealand investors who have a greater than 10% non-controlling interest. In terms of consistency with domestic options, it is not immediately clear whether this option is preferable. 13 The FIF rules provide the following methods for calculating income in respect of an offshore investment: • Branch Equivalent – taxable income is calculated as if the foreign entity invested into were a NZ branch; • Accounting profits – taxable income is calculated as the investor’s share of a foreign company’s net, after-tax accounting profit; • Comparative value – taxable income is calculated as the net change in value of a FIF interest and any distributions derived; and • Deemed rate of return – taxable income calculated by applying a deemed rate of return to the book value of the investment at the start of a tax year. 22 CIV AND INVESTOR TAX ALIGNMENT Options 1(a) and (b) in the matrix provide alternatives under a regime where the liability for income tax resides within the CIV. Tax on the income of the managed fund with a credit for tax paid (option 1(a)) replicates the current treatment of unit trusts. A single proxy rate provides a degree of administrative simplicity and addresses tax avoidance and, to some extent, deferral concerns. However, business risks stemming from calculation errors would be high, and tax asset (i.e. accumulated tax losses) treatment would be inconsistent and opaque across CIV providers. Timing advantages would accrue to investors on marginal tax rates higher than the proxy rate, while disadvantages would accrue to investors on marginal tax rates lower than the proxy rate. In some instances the latter may not be able to use the credits distributed. In addition, I do not know of an equitable method for setting the proxy rate. Option 1(b) moves beyond a proxy rate to variable final tax rates in the CIV using rates of tax reflecting the marginal tax rate of the investor – 0%, 19.5%, 33% and 39%. Such an option, one that puts final variable rates at the CIV level, is unheard of in a New Zealand context. While it may theoretically be possible, different after-tax pricing streams from one asset would mean that unit pricing functionality would need to change. While such an approach would dissolve timing advantages and disadvantages for investors, it is not clear how CIVs would monitor investors’ marginal tax rates when the liability for tax lies with the CIV. Both options 1(a) and (b) continue to tax income in the CIV, with option 1(a) replicating the company model of taxation, including imputation. Under both options, tax is implicitly included in the calculation of the unit price. This requires CIV providers to assess the income tax liability of the CIV and deduct this from net-of- expenses investment returns to generate an after-tax unit price. Options 2(a) and (b) provide alternatives under a regime where the CIV is not generally liable for tax and the income tax liability flows through to the final investor. Both options have implications for the recording of investor details (which is done in administration/unit registry systems). Both options require CIVs to allocate taxable income to individual investors’ accounts on a regular (e.g. quarterly) basis – a deemed distribution. Tax liabilities on deemed distributions of income would be calculated, deducted and paid on behalf of the investor. The balance of the distribution would be added back into the investors’ unit balance. All income would be required to be distributed or penalties would apply. Deemed distributions must be regular to reduce avoidance opportunities. 23 Option 2(a) would apply a resident withholding tax (RWT) with a wash-up. A tax calculation and payment on deemed distributions of taxable income at a single withholding tax rate would be required, with investors required to square up their tax liabilities through a tax return at the end of the tax year. This option, creates minor timing advantages and disadvantages for higher income and lower income investors respectively, and could mean that lower income investors may not be able to utilise tax credits efficiently. Compliance costs change and shift to the beneficial investor and the Inland Revenue. Where investors have excess tax to pay of $2,500 or more they would be required to pay provisional tax. Option 2(b) would be similar to the current arrangements for bank deposits, whereby investors provide their prevailing marginal tax rate to the CIV provider at the beginning of the tax year. Withholding at variable rates dissolves the timing and use of tax credit disparity issues associated with option 2(a). It successfully integrates the entity and investor marginal tax regimes. Compliance costs (systems upgrades) would be borne by the provider. Both options increase administrative complexity but reduce business risks for CIVs. Transparency of performance would improve considerably because tax management would be removed from the unit price. In addition, the tax liability shifts from the CIV to the investor. 24 Chapter 5 Stakeholder reaction THE PROCESS OF GATHERING VIEWS FROM THE INDUSTRY I took the view that if policy was going to move forward then part of the Terms of Reference had to include wide consultation of different and in some cases competing industry groups, firms and individuals. In my own experience, I found the consultation of financial intermediaries during the gestation of GST in the mid-1980s to be a relevant benchmark for the successful implementation of policy change. This consultative process was intensive, with over 70 parties identified for or asking for a face-to-face meeting or sending in comments (a full list of stakeholders consulted is contained in Appendix II). I was accompanied on most occasions by tax policy officials from the Inland Revenue and the Treasury. The format of the meetings took the form of a flip chart presentation on the objectives and constraints of the consultative process, the history and context of my Terms of Reference, the importance of efficient financial intermediation for economic growth, general taxation principles, the relevant tax boundaries and the consequent distortions, and finally options for reform. Stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to discuss the issues. I am informed that this has been one of the widest ranging and most intensive consultative processes between tax policy officials and a relevant community of interest. As a consequence, I received a large number of written responses to my presentation which have helped me understand the advantages and disadvantages of prospective changes. I am very grateful for these views. CONSENSUS ON THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS A clear consensus was expressed that New Zealand’s tax policy should deliver greater consistency of tax treatment on investment income. CONSENSUS ON THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTED There was a general consensus that it was our unique tax treatment of different boundaries that has led to economic distortions, higher transaction costs and a misallocation of scarce capital. Most considered the implicitly different definition of income for direct versus indirect investment to be the most important boundary. Clear evidence was produced that the cost to industry and ultimately investors of defining and monitoring the existing capital/revenue boundary was significant, and yet, in the 25 absence of legislation or definitive case law, compliance was problematic, and industry was still none the wiser of the boundary’s whereabouts. An appreciation was gained on what these economic distortions might mean for New Zealand’s economic growth potential. CONSENSUS ON THE OPTIONS FOR CHANGE There was clear consensus that I had identified the viable options for change within the Terms of Reference given to me. Other options mooted were variants of the options presented or were not viable, in my view. Some, such as the extension of the reforms to direct investment in New Zealand assets or a flattening of the income tax scale, while economically sensible suggestions, were not part of my Terms of Reference. When stakeholders confronted the accuracy-simplicity tradeoff they expressed a clear preference for simplicity. CONSENSUS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF CIV INCOME An overwhelming preference was expressed for a shift in the capital/revenue boundary to the point where the definition of “taxable income” for domestic equity gains in a CIV was in line with the tax treatment of direct investments on capital account. In addition to equivalence, business risks from accounting for tax, administration costs, and cashflow timing matching were given as advantages. Some considered that no change was necessary since current rules are the same for both investment channels, but an effective Inland Revenue compliance monitoring regime for individuals and a clear “brightline” for defining the capital/revenue boundary were both missing. Some considered trustee conservatism over the tax treatment of income in CIVs to be the cause of the relative tax disadvantage. A number of stakeholders raised the issue of distinguishing between the capital gains and taxable income components of a intermediate/wholesale CIV, which will generally only publish a gross unit price. There was some support for a shift from traditional transaction-based taxation to an IST. The reasons given were alignment with their preferred offshore solution, a superior tax on economic income, certainty of taxable income, and a reduction in tax receipt risks for the Government, while still moving closer to the tax treatment of direct investment on capital account since the IST would replace dividend taxation. Issues to be resolved should the Government introduce an IST included selling the concept to investors; the funding of tax liabilities when actual income is lower than the tax liabilities; the methodology for setting the rate; opening market values/base values; and part-year adjustments (capital contribution or withdrawals). 26 CONSENSUS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF OFFSHORE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT There was a grudging acceptance that the tax treatment of offshore portfolio equity investment necessarily has to be different from onshore investment because the New Zealand Government does not collect the tax on the foreign profits of foreign entities. Disagreement was expressed, however, with the application of the FIF framework, which effectively provides a deduction for foreign tax paid by the foreign entity rather than a credit. Most stakeholders’ submissions argued for the abolition of the grey list exemption and for an accompanying change in the FIF regime for portfolio investment. The principle rationale given was the distortions created by the boundary of the grey/non- grey list regimes and with onshore CIVs. Of those that advocated change, all preferred an IST regime over a comparative value regime. The rate of IST and the rate setting methodology were critical pre-conditions for assent. Despite this preference, very few stakeholders were able to enunciate a preferred methodology for setting the IST rate. Of the limited few that expressed a preference for an IST rate setting methodology, global real bond yields were preferred. A much smaller number argued for the retention of the status quo or an extension of the grey list. Reasons given were: • the loss of favourable tax treatment; • that the appropriate policy response to the grey list distortion is to extend the favourable treatment and to manage consequential leakage on a case-by-case basis; and • that New Zealand risked the emigration of high net worth investors whose capital is mobile. CONSENSUS ON THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC CIVS Most stakeholders supported a comprehensive definition around the concepts of “widely-held” entities which held portfolios of securities the individual shareholdings of which were no more than 10% and no effective control was exercisable over the company issuing the securities. Effectively, this should mean unit trusts, GIFs, superannuation schemes, and life insurance products, and investment companies could be included. Issues are outstanding on how to include defined benefit superannuation schemes and some insurance products. It is not envisaged that some venture capital and closely-held partnerships would meet the definition. 27 CONSENSUS ON THE ALIGNMENT OF TAX TREATMENT OF INVESTORS USING NEW ZEALAND CIVS Of those who commented on this issue, complete consensus was expressed for flow through tax treatment for CIVs. All stakeholders wanted taxation liability moved from the CIV to the investor, which would replicate the tax treatment of individuals investing directly. Of the two options presented for this form of treatment, a very strong preference was expressed for the introduction of a withholding tax treatment (at the investor’s nominated marginal tax rate). The strong caveat to this support was the quantification of transition costs. The fallback option was the single withholding rate option. I did receive some comments that these particular issues replicated TOLIS. 14 If the vehicle/marginal tax rate was the only boundary being reviewed, I might have met resistance to change. However the passage of time, improvements to technology and the linking of this reform to reforms of the other tax boundaries have clearly reduced resistance to change. CONSENSUS TO MOVE FORWARD Almost all stakeholders argued for a move forward from the status quo. It should be emphasised that in the time available, and in the absence of final direction, some stakeholders were unable to provide objective support for combinations of options pending completion of transition cost estimates. 14 Taxation of life insurance and superannuation fund savings, a report to the Treasurer and the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue from the Working Party on the Taxation of Life Insurance and Superannuation Fund Savings. April 1997. 28 Chapter 6 My view of the options and recommendations for change The development of options which minimise tax distortions was the core objective of the consultative process. I believe that the consensus of stakeholder views clearly signalled a more consistent outcome for the tax treatment of investment income than at present. There is therefore a strong base for refinement and legislative change. MY VIEWS My only difference with the majority of stakeholder views is a preference for an IST on domestic equity gains derived through CIVs, with the same rate setting methodology for an offshore and onshore IST. Stakeholders’ preferred options for the tax treatment of CIVs and offshore portfolio assets are compatible with minimising tax distortions and improving the consistency of tax treatment across boundaries. However, changing the definition of “taxable income” by shifting the capital/revenue boundary for domestic equity gains derived through CIVs is, in my view, inferior to the IST option, since an IST gets closer to taxing full economic income and is consistent with the preferred offshore option. I therefore favour the IST option subject to the rate setting methodology. The IST rate setting methodologies set out in Chapter 4 describe differences, depending on whether the assets are New Zealand or offshore. From an investor’s perspective, this does not seem reasonable. Policy from a national welfare perspective may differ from an investor perspective. In this case national welfare concerns may include avoidance (such as the potential for New Zealand investors to use offshore vehicles to access New Zealand assets with lower tax relative to investment in these assets directly) and capital flight (imperfect markets may result in a preference for offshore assets). The impact of the latter may affect capital-raising opportunities for New Zealand borrowers. Setting a higher IST rate on offshore portfolio equities may also lead to sub-optimal outcomes as it would affect adversely sensible investor diversification strategies. The summary of these views is that the offshore IST should not be different to the onshore IST, and both should not be lower than nominal New Zealand Government bonds. 29 My preferred option is a single inflation-indexed IST rate. Realistically, however, if we were to introduce an inflation-indexed IST there would need to be a clear commitment from the Government to inflation-index the rest of the income tax system. Otherwise inconsistencies would arise. So far, Government commitment to inflation indexing has not been forthcoming. Without such a commitment, a second- best rate-setting methodology should approximate New Zealand Government bond yields. Investors would have to be content that this may rise or fall in each tax year. If issues arise around prospective rises and falls of a market linked IST, the Government should set an acceptable fixed rate. TERMS OF REFERENCE The Terms of Reference required that “any changes should, as far as possible: a) protect the New Zealand tax base from erosion; b) minimise compliance costs; c) minimise the extent that the tax system penalises lower income savers who may not have the means or the skills to invest directly and for whom employment superannuation is a likely to be significant for retirement savings. My comments on these caveats are as follows: a) Protecting the New Zealand tax base Proposed options for change will mean that the Government faces fiscal costs. However, to the extent that the existing tax base already faces erosion problems, it is desirable to move to an economically sustainable, comprehensive and fairer basis for the taxation of investment income. It is important to note the fiscal costs of moving from the current regime to the stakeholder preferred combination of reform options. The static costs of a shift to the stakeholders’ preferred options is likely to be in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. A detailed costing should be undertaken when the proposals are more fully developed. This ignores potential dynamic gains from the introduction of a comprehensive regime and the redistributive effects on investors who face a different tax regime. b) Minimising compliance costs Different options create different compliance costs for the Government, industry and investors. The preferred options will result in a sharing of these costs. These costs need to be linked to the benefits from a reduction in tax distortions. 30 Industry compliance costs are concentrated within the preferred options proposed for aligning the taxation of CIVs and the marginal rate of their investors. Principally, the costs relate to upgrades to systems. I have endeavoured to scope costs using the advice of third party systems suppliers and do not believe that the costs are insurmountable. On their own, the cost of these changes may be problematic. It is therefore highly desirable that if these changes are implemented, they are accompanied by changes to the definition of “taxable income”, where the costs of compliance are much smaller, but the benefits considerably larger. Additional costs may be incurred by suppliers from the alignment of investor tax rates through CIVs as providers move to rationalise product. The tax rationale for offering different products would be redundant. Stakeholders were also concerned about part-year adjustments under an IST. A potential solution for investment through a CIV is to look at applying the IST to daily market values. This would mean that the final tax liability would represent an average through the tax year. This would eliminate the part-year adjustment complexity and would mitigate investor avoidance issues. Government’s compliance costs are mainly concentrated in the options proposed for the redefinition of “taxable income”, which would require changes to administration systems (leaving aside the larger issue of fiscal costs of a regime change). Investor costs are concentrated in the proposed IST following the removal of the grey list for offshore portfolio investment, which will alter tax liabilities. Compliance costs should not change as filing tax returns for dividends will effectively be replaced by filing an IST return. In the time available, I was not able to give enough thought to the level of a de-minimis threshold that would exempt an investor from an IST regime. c) Lower income savers Savers on marginal tax rates of 19.5% or less are penalised when using tax-paid CIVs such as superannuation schemes or life insurance, or where CIVs treated as companies for tax purposes distribute income (with excess and partially unusable credits attached). The preferred option for the taxation of CIVs largely dissolves this problem. However, there are several consequences that need to be thought through. 31 Beneficiaries The interaction of the income tax system with the abatement of benefits upon receiving more income was acknowledged as an issue following the introduction of the Government’s recent Working for Families package. This package will create high effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) in certain circumstances (see Appendix V). Theoretically, beneficiaries with high effective marginal tax rates should be saving through tax-paid vehicles now, such as superannuation schemes, since they receive an obvious tax benefit. If the Government accepts the flow through option for taxing CIVs, beneficiaries who save through CIVs will receive more taxable income and their benefits will abate. An illustration of the abatement regime is also included in Appendix V. I have no empirical evidence that such beneficiaries, per se, are an important source of savings. I therefore recommend that the proposed changes to the taxation of investment income are not altered to suit this class of investors. If the Government is concerned about the issue it should be addressed explicitly through altering how such benefits are administered. Tax-exempt entities Tax-exempt entities such as charities find tax-paid CIVs inefficient and cannot use imputation credits distributed by unit trusts, GIFs or companies. The only advantage they will derive from the preferred combination of options is the proposed flow through tax treatment for CIVs where those CIVs hold debt instruments. CIVs which hold equity are still inefficient for tax-exempt entities as imputation credits are unable to be used. Workplace superannuation The taxation of workplace superannuation was specifically raised by the Savings Product Working Group as an issue which may alter the conclusions of the Group’s report, released in early September 2004. 15 In terms of the crossover with my work, the Group specifically was interested in: “– The divergence between the marginal tax rate of the individual saving/investing through a managed fund and the tax treatment of the vehicle through which that saving is taking place; – The matter of the tax treatment of capital gains made by such funds (the business and purpose test rules).” 15 A Future for Work-Based Savings in New Zealand, Final Report of the Savings Product Working Group, 31 August 2004. 32 I believe that the consensus-derived options solve the Group’s concerns, since flow through preserves investors’ correct marginal tax rates, with potentially no more compliance for the investor, and the business and purpose tests disappear for CIVs in relation to domestic equity. However, there are issues to consider. Firstly, transition costs will be required to improve CIV unit registry, and employer-based superannuation scheme administration systems (which calculate entitlements, income distributions and taxation liabilities for investors). These will be required to record the correct marginal tax rates and liabilities of investors. CIV providers use a variety of unit registry software systems, from proprietary-based to third party-sourced, but only one CIV product (a category of GIFs) record tax liabilities on income at the correct marginal rate of tax. Many employer-based schemes outsource investor record keeping functions to third party administrators who have different systems. If the flow through option is to be pursued, and I recommend it is, then some time must be given to suppliers to cost the changes, and it must be accompanied by changes to the definition of taxable income. This will provide a reason for businesses to upgrade or invest in new platform technologies. In addition, the proposed definition of CIVs currently excludes defined benefit employer superannuation plans. It would be more consistent if they were included but time has not permitted sufficient exploration of how this could be achieved. MAIN TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Communication of the IST The most obvious communication issue is how investors should position their portfolios in response to the known annual tax liability generated by the introduction of an IST. We do not have information on where investors’ growth/income asset mix is positioned now, and therefore whether they should become more or less risk averse, given the required cashflow to meet IST liabilities. However, it seems to me that because the tax liability is known from the beginning of the tax year, no one should have any excuses for not planning for its payment at the end of the tax year. In other words, investors should always hold cash or income assets to cover the known liability. If legislators are concerned at the prospect of the “Holmes effect” – media amplification of constituents complaining of having to pay tax when total returns are negative – then I have little sympathy because: 33 • investors pay tax on dividends now when total returns are negative; • an IST liability is quantified a year in advance of payment, providing plenty of opportunity for cashflow management; and • if the actual issue is the volatility of equity returns, then portfolio rebalancing from growth to income assets, not challenging the tax impost, is the appropriate solution. Treatment of accumulated tax losses Some tax-paid CIVs have recently accumulated large tax losses (tax assets) as a result of falling capital values, principally due to global share prices. These will need to be preserved if the Government moves to the proposed flow through treatment for CIVs. Options could include cashing out the losses directly to prevailing investors, or distributing them as a tax loss able to be carried forward. The preferred solution is for this to occur at the point at which the reform commences. 34 Chapter 7 Next steps I made it clear during the consultation phase that my formal contribution to this process concluded at the end of October 2004. Provided that subsequent public discussion mirrors issues raised in this document, I would strongly recommend finessing, costing and implementing the preferred combination of options, with enough time for stakeholders to cost and plan for the transition. It is my sincere hope that, after this interactive process, Government and industry and investors continue to commit to reform. The alternative is not palatable. It is not obvious to me that a democratic process of consensus building towards an improved sustainable system of taxation of investment income for New Zealand investors during a clear window of goodwill can be surpassed as a strong process for change. 35 Appendix I Terms of Reference The Government will appoint an independent Chair to ascertain whether a consensus is emerging on how to address the current problems with the taxation of investment income, both domestically and offshore. The Chair would be responsible for consultation on options that are consistent with developing such a consensus. The Chair would consult widely with the New Zealand savings industry and other interested stakeholders. The mandate of the Chair will be to resolve issues and inconsistencies in the tax law, (primarily as they apply to New Zealand portfolio investors – those under 10% ownership interests in companies or other entities), whether those investments occur directly in companies, other entities, or indirectly via intermediaries. It should be assumed that the basic structure of tax laws outside the area of investment will not be altered and will therefore be outside the Terms of Reference for this work. An across- the-board capital gains tax, taxation of owner-occupied housing and the basic treatment of debt instruments under the accrual rules are not within the Terms of Reference. It would be outside the scope of the work for the Chair to consider alternatives to the tax treatment of savings that are not consistent with the TTE (tax/tax/exempt) model applied in New Zealand or to consider savings-related concessions. Some related specialist areas, such as the tax rules for life insurance may be impacted by any options put forward. While it would be useful to note these impacts, in the time available it would not be feasible for the Chair to consider the many detailed issues that changes to the tax treatment of savings might involve. In its broadest terms, the Chair should consider options for making the tax law more consistent between direct and indirect investment so as to improve the efficiency and fairness of the taxation of savings and in particular to reduce any tax impediments to the ability of ordinary New Zealanders to save for their retirement. The objective of this work is to develop options for change that would minimise the extent to which the tax system distorts the way New Zealanders invest (direct versus an intermediary or via different intermediaries). As far as possible New Zealand resident intermediaries should not face tax penalties compared to direct investment and similar offshore entities New Zealanders might invest in. 36 In meeting the above objective, any option for change should, as far as possible: (1) Protect the New Zealand tax base from erosion. Examples include investment in low or no tax jurisdictions, or investment in no or low tax entities in high tax jurisdictions. (2) Minimise compliance costs for New Zealand investors and the New Zealand savings industry. For example, any requirement for individual investors who are currently not required to file tax returns to start filing such returns would increase compliance costs. Similarly the New Zealand savings industry has expressed concerns regarding compliance costs imposed on them under certain current tax rules. (3) Minimise the extent to which the tax system penalises lower income earners who may not have the means or the skills to invest directly and for whom employment superannuation is likely to be significant for retirement savings. For example, it would be desirable that those on a low rate of tax are not taxed at a higher rate on their superannuation savings. It should be noted that the points above, may at times be, contradictory in practice, which is why there is likely to be several options proposed along with their advantages and disadvantages. Revenue neutrality is not an objective of this work. The Government would like to consider the most viable options (having regard to the objective and points (1) to (3)) above identified by the Chair, irrespective of their revenue implications. Revenue implications should however, to the extent possible, be identified since these would need to be taken into account in any final decision. The Government considers that the Chair should be charged with: - Establishing if there is general agreement on whether the objective and points (1) to (3) above are the principal issues in the area of taxation of investment income. - Identifying the boundaries that exist in the area of the current taxation of investment income, both domestically and offshore. - Ascertaining whether a consensus can be achieved on how to resolve problems associated with these boundaries, in consultation with the New Zealand savings industry and other interested stakeholders. - Developing options for reform that are consistent with these boundaries, in consultation with the New Zealand savings industry and other interested stakeholders. - Developing options for reform that are consistent with such a consensus. - Identifying the advantages and disadvantages of the options considered. - Reporting to the Minister of Finance and Revenue on viable options by the end of October 2004. 37 Appendix II Stakeholders consulted ABN Amro Craigs AMA Capital Ltd Aon Consulting New Zealand Ltd Association of Superannuation Funds of New Zealand Asteron Life Limited Aventine Consulting AXA New Zealand Bank of New Zealand Brook Asset Management Ltd BT Funds Management (NZ) Ltd Chris Horton Cleary Financial Services Ltd Consumers Institute Corporate Taxpayers Group Deloitte Direct Capital Private Equity Ltd Diversified Investment Strategies Ltd Eriksen & Associates Ltd Ernst & Young Ltd Fidelity Life Assurance Company Ltd Financial Focus (New Zealand) Ltd Financial Planners & Insurance Advisers Association First NZ Capital FMG Investment Advisors Fund Distributors Ltd FundSource Research Ltd Greg Dwyer ING (NZ) Ltd Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Investment Savings & Insurance Association of NZ Inc John Key, National Party Spokesperson on Finance KPMG Martini Consulting Ltd MCA Ltd Melville Jessup Weaver Mercer Milford Asset Management Ltd Ministry of Social Development Minter Ellison Rudd Watts MMc Ltd Morel & Co Morgan Taylor Ltd Morningstar NZ Northplan NZ Assets Management Ltd NZ Business Roundtable NZ Exchange Ltd NZ Funds Management Ltd NZ Law Society NZ Society of Actuaries NZ Society of Investment Professionals NZ Venture Capital Association Inc Paul Dyer PricewaterhouseCoopers Public Trust Reserve Bank of New Zealand Retirement Commission Rob Dowler Russell Investment Group Ltd Russell McVeagh Savings Product Working Group Securities Industry Association Select Asset Management Shortland Management Sovereign Ltd Strategic Asset Management Tacit Group Tower Limited Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand Trustees Executors Ltd Tyndall Investment Management NZ Ltd Watson Wyatt NZ Ltd Women in Super 38 Appendix III “Financial systems and economic growth: An evaluation framework for policy” – a summary The full text of this Treasury working paper is at available at http://www.treasury.govt.nz/workingpapers/2004/04-17.asp The purpose of the paper is to develop an analytical framework for discussing the link between financial systems and economic growth. The paper does not attempt to assess the adequacy of New Zealand’s financial system in providing financial services. Rather it highlights the importance of financial development for economic growth and identifies key policy priorities. Section 2 reviews the role of financial intermediaries and markets and their comparative advantages in providing external finance to firms. The following conclusions emerge: first, existing theory suggests a clear link between financial systems and economic growth. Financial intermediaries and markets can overcome an information asymmetry in credit markets. They help reduce information and transaction costs and improve the allocation of resources, leading to faster economic growth. Second, financial intermediaries and markets offer a range of financial services to firms that are not complete substitutes. Section 3 establishes the theoretical link between financial systems and economic growth. There are two main channels through which financial systems can have an effect on economic growth: capital accumulation and technological innovation. The cost of external finance is discussed in section 4. With imperfect information, capital is only available at a higher real interest rate. The supply curve may even become positively sloped at some point as the level of external financing increases. At a country level, the supply of capital may no longer be infinitely elastic, which has implications for a small open economy. At an individual supplier level, with imperfect information, the supply of capital curve may become backward bending or downward sloping, i.e. lenders reduce their supply of funds as interest rates increase, leading to forms of credit rationing. Section 5 reviews the empirical evidence on the connection between a country’s financial development and its rate of economic growth, whether a shift to financial markets or intermediaries affects growth rates and the importance of financing constraints. Countries with better developed financial systems tend to grow faster than countries with smaller banking systems and less liquid financial markets. But cross-country comparisons do not reveal significant differences between the economic growth of countries with more market based or more intermediary based financial systems. The international evidence suggests that finance constraints are empirically 39 important in particular for small firms. The finding supports the theoretical proposition that credit rationing for some firms may represent a common response by financial markets and intermediaries as they attempt to resolve information asymmetries. New Zealand data and empirical analysis to date are limited. Section 6 discusses the importance of the legal environment and other policy influences for financial development. The following conclusions emerge. Maintaining solid legal foundations is important because the financial system relies on these. Moreover, a legal system that is able to respond to the financial needs of an economy fosters financial development more effectively than a more rigid legal system. Section 7 assesses the potential effects of the New Zealand tax system on the financial system. It first reviews the taxation of capital gains and then outlines how New Zealand’s tax system, which classifies some capital gains as taxable income while exempting others, acts to distort the investment patterns toward direct investments in larger and less risky firms or toward passive indexing tracking funds. The section concludes that removing tax distortions that prevent/lower the production and discovery of information will lead to increased investment and output. The magnitude of these effects is uncertain but possibly significant. The economic benefit could be substantial if resolving existing distortions would increase firms’ ability to borrow in future. Moreover, additional investment may lead to technological innovation as firms with high investment in intellectual property or with novel business plans are particularly affected by information asymmetry and as a result are more likely to face finance constraints. Section 8 discusses the main sources of financial instability. It reviews the role of financial regulation and supervision and briefly examines the regulatory and supervisory approach in New Zealand. The need for regulation and supervision of the financial system arises because financial intermediaries and markets, like firms, are subject to asymmetric information. A key objective for financial regulation and supervision is to increase the effective functioning of the financial system in order to enhance the ability to absorb shocks and maintain financial stability. The section suggests a review of certain aspects of New Zealand’s financial system in the context of financial regulation and supervision. Given the importance of financial development for economic growth, it is valuable to be certain that New Zealand’s institutional framework and current responsibilities for financial regulation and supervision are best suited to meet its particular needs. The last section summarises and concludes. 40 The paper’s appendix outlines insights economics can provide to guide the taxation of financial intermediaries in a country such as New Zealand that has chosen not to tax full economic income by not employing a capital gains tax. The appendix suggests that to tax the capital gains of investors who use intermediaries is to apply a broader tax base to those investors than to those who use other, non-financial services. A lower use of financial services and a greater use of other services would be predicted and firms that rely on intermediated finance are likely to suffer in New Zealand as a result. 41 Appendix IV Background to the tax rules for CIVs Introduction Currently there is a range of tax treatments that apply to investment entities in New Zealand. While the entity tax environment may, on the face of it, seem ad hoc a policy and/or historical rationale can generally be identified to explain the entity- specific rules. The benchmark for the design of tax rules for investment entities is the tax treatment of the individual. The tax system should, to the extent that it is possible and practical, integrate the tax treatment of an entity with its beneficial owners. This means that an investor should be indifferent to investing via an entity and investing directly. The caveat on this is that for policy reasons it may be considered desirable to claw back tax preferences allowed at the entity level (e.g. taxing capital gains distributed as dividends) and/or to restrict access to entity losses. Nevertheless the useful benchmark is the tax treatment of the individual. However, different entities have different characteristics and functions. Therefore, the extent to which integration is possible, and the means by which this is achieved, will vary. Full integration versus company imputation Essentially there are two approaches to taxing entities. The first approach is to impose a tax on the entity itself. The second approach is to attribute the tax base of the entity directly to the beneficial owners (i.e. integration). It has generally been considered that an integrated model is problematic for widely- held entities for a number of reasons. First, taxing the beneficial owners on profits of widely-held entities as they accrue is complex administratively as it would involve allocating income to each owner and identifying owners’ marginal tax rates. Second, not imposing a withholding tax on the entity could increase the likelihood that income is deferred or avoided. In addition, in a discretionary trust context, it would be extremely difficult to measure (or even approximate) the income that should be attributed to a discretionary beneficiary before it is actually allocated by the trustee. 42 The company tax with imputation model solves many of these problems for widely- held entities. It provides a single withholding tax (the company tax) at the entity level to address administrative, deferral and avoidance concerns. By taxing distributions at shareholders’ marginal tax rates and providing a credit for company tax paid, the company tax model achieves a level of integration. This explains the current tax treatment of companies, unit trusts, GIF As and life insurance. The history of the taxation of investment entities is quite closely related to the development of our company tax system. Prior to 1958 dividends were not taxable in the hands of shareholders (they were however included in the shareholder’s income in order to establish the investor’s marginal tax rate). Inclusion of distributions for tax rate calculation purposes raised the question as to why dividends were not taxed as income. This led to a “classical” company tax system in New Zealand from 1958 until 1988. Under the “classical” system income was taxed at the company level and again at the shareholder level upon distribution, with no credit provided for the company tax paid. In 1988 the imputation system for companies was introduced. The following table provides a summary of the current tax rules applying to the main types of investment entities and a brief explanation of the history and underlying policy of the rules. Entity type Tax rules/Policy rationale Individuals Tax rules: taxation of income (i.e. not of a capital nature) is at marginal tax rates. Partnership Tax rules: partnership income is taxed to the individual partners at their marginal tax rates (“look through” tax treatment). Policy rationale: under general law a partnership is not a separate legal entity (i.e. partnership is fiscally transparent and partners are jointly and severally liable). This explains the current tax rules that tax the individual partners on their share of the partnership income. Companies Tax rules: income of the company (i.e. revenue gains) is taxed at 33%. Distributions to shareholders are taxed at marginal tax rates with a credit for tax paid at the company level. Imputation claws-back preferences on distribution to shareholders (e.g. taxation of any untaxed capital gains of the company). Tax losses made at the company level cannot be passed through to shareholders. Policy rationale: the tax treatment of companies has been integrated to a large extent with the tax treatment of individuals (i.e. rate alignment) with the introduction of imputation in 1988. The full history is detailed above. Flowing-through preferences (e.g. capital gains) under imputation was rejected partly because, on introduction of imputation, companies had significant retained earnings for which no imputation credits were available. Allowing these amounts to be distributed with the preferences flowed-through would have resulted in a significant revenue loss. Pass-through of losses to shareholders was rejected due to concerns about “fake” losses in the tax system. 43 Trusts Tax rules: income is taxed to the trustee at 33%. Beneficiary income (i.e. income of the trust that is distributed within the income year of derivation or six months after the end of the year) is taxed at the marginal tax rates of beneficiaries. Policy rationale: the company tax model was deemed inappropriate on the basis that, for a trust, property rights are uncertain – i.e. don’t know how many beneficiaries there are and what their share of the trust’s assets are. Consequently, it is difficult to have imputation. Instead, trusts have a final tax (on trustee income) with any income distributed to beneficiaries as it is earned by the trust (beneficiary income) taxed at the marginal rates of beneficiaries to provide a level of rate alignment for trust income. Where a trust distributes income as it is earned these amounts are clearly directly attributable to the recipient. It is therefore appropriate to tax this income as if it was earned by the beneficiary. There is no pass-through of losses. This is based on the trust concept that a beneficiary should only get positive amounts. Superannuation Schemes Tax rules: taxed as a trust (which they are) but with a final tax at the scheme level so trust income is not attributed to individuals – i.e. qualifying trust tax treatment. This means that the income of the superannuation scheme (i.e. revenue gains) is taxed at 33%. Distributions are tax free, which means that tax preferences (e.g. capital gains) are not clawed-back on distribution. Income earned by a superannuation scheme that is distributed immediately is not taxed at the investor’s marginal tax rate (i.e. there is no “beneficiary income” rule) on the basis that superannuation should relate to saving for retirement (long-term). Schemes should therefore not be making distributions as income is earned. Policy rationale: superannuation schemes were given trust tax treatment as at the time of introduction of the rules, in the late 1980’s, all schemes were established as trusts. Prior to this, certain superannuation scheme income received concessionary tax treatment. In late 1987, it was announced that the tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance would be moved onto the same basis as other forms of savings and investment. Broadly, the main reasons for the reform that led to the current rules were: • A move to a broad base and low rate (i.e. removing concessions to make the rate lower and less variable). • Treatment according to the type of saving or institutional form through which saving was channelled distorted patterns of savings by favouring some taxpayers over others and added to the complexity of the system. Life insurance Tax rules: tax is imposed on the life insurance business for profits attributable to shareholders (the life office base) and also on investment income attributable to policyholders (the policyholder base). This is the first level of tax. A tax credit is available to shareholders for tax paid at the first tier. Tax credits also available for distributions in respect of policyholders (e.g. an increase in actuarial reserves) Policy rationale: in 1990 the taxation of life insurance was moved to a basis analogous to the full imputation system applying to companies – i.e. shareholders and policyholders of a life insurance business treated similarly to shareholders in a limited liability company. The rationale for this was the provision of insurance becoming more substitutable with financial intermediation. Prior to 1990, the taxation of superannuation schemes was limited to the taxation of investment income. 44 Unit Trusts Tax rules: taxed as companies. The income of a unit trust (i.e. revenue gains) is therefore taxed at 33%. Distributions to unit holders are taxed with credits for tax paid by the unit trust (imputation). Preferences (e.g. capital gains) are clawed- back on distribution. Policy rationale: unit trusts were developed in the 1960s to compete with investment companies. Legislation was introduced to regulate the management of the trusts and to safeguard the interests of investors. It was thought logical (at the same time) to apply the tax law relating to companies to these entities because in substance they do not differ from investment companies. The history of tax treatment for unit trusts is therefore linked to the company tax treatment. Group Investment Funds Tax rules: Category A income – defined as income that is not category B income. This income is subject to company tax treatment Category B income – income from designated sources (i.e. income from trusts that are estates, or are created by statute or Court order). This income is subject to trust tax treatment Policy rationale: GIFs were primarily established to get around the company tax treatment for unit trusts. Tax rules for GIFs were introduced in the early 1980s and imposed one set of rules on Category A income and another set of rules on Category B income. The rationale for this is as follows: Category A GIFs were considered to be competing with investment companies and unit trusts – therefore received company tax treatment. Category B GIFs were not competing at this level as they were established to benefit widows/orphans, etc – therefore received trust tax treatment. 45 Appendix V Working for Families – effective marginal tax rates, and abatements Impact of flow through tax treatment on recipients of family assistance One of the issues that will need to be considered by Government is the impact of allowing CIVs to pass through income to investors (for tax purposes) on the abatements of social assistance received by those savers – that is, savers who are recipients of family assistance and beneficiaries. Currently, income is quarantined within certain CIVs (e.g. superannuation schemes) and so do not affect entitlements to and abatements of assistance. Anecdotally, this group does not seem to be a significant constituency for the New Zealand savings industry at present. However, the introduction of the new Working for Families family assistance package will mean that at the time of its full implementation (in 2008), savers on relatively high income levels may be recipients of Government transfers. The graphs below (figures 5 and 6, respectively) outline the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) for a single earner family of four (two adults, two children) in receipt of family assistance, pre and post the full implementation of the Working for Families package. The assumptions that have been made are: • the family lives in South Auckland and rents accommodation; • accommodation costs are $300 per week and the family receives an accommodation supplement; and • the family does not receive any other social assistance. Figure 5 illustrates the EMTRs faced in the 2005 year. If the market income of the single earner is $60,000, their EMTR would be approximately 40%. 46 Figure 5: EMTRs in 2005 EMTR 0.0% 10.0% 20.0% 30.0% 40.0% 50.0% 60.0% 70.0% 80.0% 90.0% 100.0% 110.0% 0 3,0006,0009,000 12,00015,00018,00021,00024,00027,00030,00033,00036,00039,00042,00045,00048,00051,00054,00057,00060,00063,00066,00069,00072,00075,00078,00081,000 Income Total 2005 EMTR Tax Family assistance abatement Family tax credit abatement Accomodation supplement abatement ACC earner premium Figure 6 illustrates the EMTRs faced in the 2008 year, when the Working for families package will be fully implemented.

The tests under the capital/revenue boundary are not fully described in legislation. They have a long history in the common law. CIV – collective investment vehicle, a term used to describe various vehicles used by New Zealand investors to access a portfolio of investments. These vehicles offer pooling of risk and opportunities for portfolio diversification. Examples include unit trusts, superannuation schemes, and life insurance (so called “managed funds”). The issue of what should be a CIV for the purposes of the options for reform presented is discussed in Chapter 4. FIF – the Foreign Investment Fund Rules, the regime that applies for calculating income from non-controlled equity investments in so-called non-grey list countries. The FIF rules provide four methods for calculating income from non-grey list investments, namely branch equivalent (income calculated as if the foreign entity invested into were a New Zealand branch), comparative value (income calculated as the change in share value plus dividends derived) and the deemed rate of return (income calculated based on an assumed rate of return) methods. Flow through tax treatment – an option for reform whereby income derived by a CIV would pass through to its beneficial owners. The CIV would become transparent for tax purposes (like a partnership) with income and the consequent tax liability resting with the ultimate investor. Grey list – a group of seven countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany and Norway. Equity investments in these countries by New Zealand investors receive a tax preferred treatment – typically only taxation on dividends derived – relative to investment in other countries which are subject to the FIF rules. The grey list is based on the assumption that the countries in it have similar tax systems (and rates) to that of New Zealand, thereby reducing the incentives for New Zealand investors to use these destinations to avoid tax. IST – the Investment and Savings Tax, an umbrella term used to describe the variants of the RFRM proposed over the last four years in New Zealand. Taxable income under an IST would be calculated by multiplying the opening value of an investor’s portfolio by an assumed rate of return (the IST rate). Non-grey list – all countries outside the seven grey list countries. Investments by New Zealanders in these countries are taxed under the FIF rules. 48 Offshore portfolio investment in equity – investment of 10% or less in foreign equity (i.e. an ownership interest of 10% or less in the foreign entity). The 10% threshold is the internationally recognised distinction between portfolio and non- portfolio investment. RFRM – the Risk Free Return Method, proposed by the Tax Review 2001. The Review recommended the RFRM as a means of rationalising the entity tax rules. Taxable income under an RFRM would be calculated by multiplying the opening asset value by the RFRM rate. The Review recommended that the RFRM rate be based on New Zealand Government bond yields adjusted for inflation (a “real” rate) Standard Return Method – an option for reform of the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment that would tax the opening value of such an investment at a standard rate of return based on a reasonable dividend yield of 4%. The standard return method was suggested by tax policy officials in an issues paper released in late 2003.
