TAX WORKING GROUP - SUBMISSION Environmental Challenges. Fresh Water. A tax on irrigation would be sensible as well as a high tax on the extraction of water for bottling or selling in any form, especially water that is exported, in which case the tax should be extremely high. Emission of Pollutants. Current polluters should be taxed at a rate which deters them from such activities and compensates for possible loss of our future quality of life. The rate of tax should be variable according to the effects of the activity concerned. The Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, which is not only polluting adjacent air, land and sea but also having serious effects on the oyster industry, all currently subsidized by the taxpayer, is a good example of a polluter that should pay a pollution tax at the maximum rate. Tourism and Visitors. There should be an entry tax for visitors of at least $100 which could then be distributed to Local Authorities to assist paying for infrastructure. This would provide essential services that ratepayers are currently supporting, while most of us derive no benefit whatsoever and actually are negatively affected by the effect on infrastructure and on the natural environment. Capital Gains. Proposing Capital Gains Tax on Works of Art. I was a valuer at Sotheby & Co in London in the 1960’s when such a tax was introduced on works of art. In 1965 items worth over GBP 1000 qualified for such a tax. I do not think it would be appropriate in NZ given that there are probably insufficient valuable works of art here to sensibly support such a move. A Capital Gains Tax on works of art could be highly disadvantageous to artists and other creative people who depend on sales of their work for their livelihoods. A Capital Gains Tax on residential properties should not be considered. Encouragement should be given for residential property investment as there are insufficient rental properties available and that is one of the reasons why rents have escalated so much. Many families cannot now afford to own their own dwellings. If the numbers of residential rentals increased then there would be much more competition for tenants and possibly a lowering of rents. State Housing is not performing well and many State Houses have been sold off over the last few decades. Your video “ Can tax make housing more affordable” is not logical in this regard in that there is no connection between imposing a Capital Gains Tax and housing becoming more affordable. (The Nelson Mail, Monday 16 April 2018) Tight rental market 'utter hell' for house hunters Rental prices in the Nelson region have hit new highs, two reports show, on the back of a big fall in the number of rental properties available. The median rent in Nelson/Tasman rose 10.5 per cent in the year to March to $420 a week, according to the latest Trade Me Property Rental Index. The increase was second only to Hawke’s Bay, where the median rent grew 14.3 per cent to $400 a week. Competition for rental properties in Nelson, resulting from the shortage, was described by one house-hunter as ‘‘utter hell’’. ‘‘I went to one \[viewing\] in Oxford St in Richmond, and about 30, 40 people must have turned up, if not more,’’ said the man, who doesn’t want to be named for fear of jeopardising the rental house in Stoke that has taken him and his family three months to find. Land Tax. Given that land is already taxed by local authorities via rates, a land tax would mean double taxation. A Land Tax would increase outgoings for already challenged home owners and would increase property rentals since it would be passed on to tenants. A land tax would also pose difficulties for farmers, many of whom are already challenged. Tax on Multinationals and Overseas Corporations. There should be a move to tax all overseas corporations earning funds in New Zealand properly as they are not contributing sensibly to the tax yield. It would be acceptable for the Tax Working Group and Secretariat to make contact about any points raised, if required. Anthony Opie . \[1\]

Tax Submission: 1/ Get rid of all racially based Taxation and Charitable status Taxation laws and policies. Tax policy primarily should be about gathering and redistributing revenue in a fair and equitable manner The Government vocalizes on the success of the $50 Billion growing Maori business and their growing entrepreneurial base yet it openly gives preferential advantage with tax exemptions and allowing them dubious charitable status. There is also a lack of accountability around businesses posing as charities, of individuals being paid too much, and that too little was being distributed. "A review of the charitable status area should cover both the non-profit sector and charitable sector, for example Māori trusts, unions, lobby groups, environmental groups, sporting clubs." Britain amended this charitable tax loophole in the 1920s and ACT party leader David Seymour wants New Zealand to catch up and do the same. The Government also has a ridiculous policy of “engaging with Maori” so it can be told that they don’t want to pay tax. The act of “engaging with Maori” is also a false notion as the only engagement is with tribal elite, advocates of Tribal Governance. They do not represent the majority of Maori people Being a “Maori business” is not an excuse for underperforming and not paying tax. The racially divisive policy giving a Maori business tax concessions is an insult to all New Zealanders. Such incentives are not advanced to any of the other ethnic groups in NZ. Taxes are not collected from Non Maori organizations to be distributed to the untaxed Maori. To single out one group is racist to say the least! Comment by Dr the Hon Lockwood Smith “It does confirm privilege under our tax laws, purely on the basis of race”. Michael Cullen’s Labour Government has further entrenched racism in tax laws instead of eliminating it Cullen’s Labour Government introduced the discounted Maori Authority business tax rate (now 17.5 percent) and changed the law to enable billion-dollar tribal corporations to register as charities and avoid paying tax. These anomalies gives wealthy Maori businesses a significant competitive advantage. Cullen’s Labour Government appears to be considering additional tax benefits and exemptions for Maori business. The tribal elite has also convinced National to make advantageous policy changes, such as introducing co-governance arrangements at central and local government level, and funding tribal groups to claim New Zealand’s entire coastline. They now appear to have convinced Labour to give them yet more tax favours. It must be noted that none of these racially discriminatory policies have not made any difference to the standing of Maori People. It just allows the already wealthy Tribal Elite to get richer at the expense of every other ethnicity in NZ! Get rid of all racially based Taxation and Charitable status Taxation laws and policies. http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/5130429/Super-rich-tribes-pay-no-tax https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/96742698/How-some-New-Zealand-business-make-billions-and-pay- no-tax https://www.hobsonspledge.nz/tribal\_tax\_exemption\_must\_go?utm\_campaign=midweek\_update2&ut m\_medium=email&utm\_source=hobsonspledge https://thespinoff.co.nz/atea/04-04-2018/maori-and-the-tax-working-group-how-do-we-make-the- system-more-fair/ https://www.nzcpr.com/a-tax-sham/ 2/ Keep our taxation system simple! Leave the present policies on land tax and capital Gains tax alone! Remove all racially divisive Policy and Laws. Remove all charitable institutions from tax exemption status. Keep the taxation rates as simple as possible. Use policy and procedure to accomplish the behavioral modifications. Leave property taxes as they are. Under the current law, a capital gains tax on rental housing already exists and anyone buying a house purely to capture the gains of a rising property market will pay tax on the profit – if they are not captured by the five-year bright line test then they will be by the intention test. Capital gains taxing on a yearly basis will just allow the cost to be more easily passed on to renters. If rental housing is not profitable the investor will need to charge more to make it worth their while or move to a different form of investing. The only people that will be affected are the renters. Keep our taxation system simple! Leave the present policies on land tax and capital Gains tax alone! 3/ Fuel Tax is already 50% of the cost of fuel. Leave it alone and open the books so the public can see that revenue collected for road infrastructure is spent on roads! 4/ Stop referring to the Maori Economy! Stop referring to Te Ao Maori and the future! They is a racially divisive, meaningless statistics based on false premises. The fact is that anyone with the infinitesimally smallest portion of Maori heritage can claim to be Maori or not. It does not include people with Maori blood that list themselves as European. It also has absolutely no meaning as it does not include reference to any other economy. It is a meaningless, false, representation of success. What contribution do the Chinese make to the economy, the Indians, the Asians or Non Maori Europeans, others? Why doesn’t the government measure that and support these Ethnic Economies with equal fervor? Why does the Government want a separate racially divisive taxation system for the Maori economy? Stop referring to the Maori Economy! Stop referring to Te Ao Maori and the future! They is a racially divisive, meaningless statistics based on false premises. 5/ Stop using Maori words intermingled within an English written document! It is confusing as 98% of readers have no knowledge of this language and you will not teach anyone using one word at a time. You are introducing errors in interpretation.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Thanks for the opportunity to suggest improvements to our current tax system. My suggestions are below: 1) We should have a financial transaction tax at a low rate (eg 0.1%) on every movement of money from anywhere to anywhere. This would be simple to apply (like GST), and would discourage speculation (which adds nothing to the value of NZ) or at least gain some benefit for NZ from it. Some have suggested this is simply GST for the rich, and like GST, the income from it should be used to offset other taxes (like income tax). There should be no exceptions (for simplicity). 2) Income tax bands should move every year with inflation (or use some other transparent calculation). Failure to do this reults in an increasing tax take without any discussion about increasing taxes. This is simply unfair, and allows goverrnments to claim to be giving a tax decrease every few years, when simply restoring parity to a system broken by inflation and time. 3) Capital gains taxes, while great in theory, are likely to be complex (particularly if there are exemptions eg ‘family home’), to have high compliance costs and to raise only small amounts of revenue - certainly in the short term. The questions then become, do we want to send ‘signals to the market’ by using capital gains taxes ? Would these signals work ? ... and is this likely to raise significant money or simply cause aggravation ? I suspect capital gains taxes in general, will be more trouble than they are worth, and won’t send useful “signals” - particularly if there are large sections of the economy with exemptions. If we have one, there needs to be no exceptions. It may be wise to allow some kind of deferred liability (at zero interest) so that no cash is payable until the asset/property is sold. 4) GST should be lowered to a maximum of 10% (using other taxes to offset the income lost). This tax tends to hit those on lower incomes the most. This tax otherwise works well. 5) A carbon tax should replace the ineffective emissions trading scheme (which has never worked). This is the only useful way to encourage people to move away from burning things. 6) Resources of all sorts should be taxed when extracted/used. This should be used to allow for “public bads” often left behind by extractive industries to be cleaned up/fixed/repaired. Perhaps this could be achieved by taking a percentage of their income as a bond, to be returned after (say) 50 years of no problems. This should encourage doing things properly the first time, and would allow for our current lack of knowledge in many areas - many toxic sites requiring clean up now were run correctly at the time with the knowledge we then had. It is not acceptable that the cost of public bads from private profit enterprises should be be paid for by those not profiting. Suggest that this sort of resource tax should apply (at a much higher rate where the turnover of organisations is high) to “developers” that regularly wind themselves up to avoid any possibility of previous liabilities. This is simply cheating and should be discouraged - vigourously. 7) There should be some level of income that is tax free, and/or a state provided basic income for everyone. This would discourage the disparaging of “beneficiaries”, encourage people to do some work, and allow them to keep more/some of what they earn when they do. It makes no sense to say that people must work, when their marginal tax rate is more than 50% if they do. Add any kind of work related expenses to this, and it is no surprise to me that people say it “isn’t worth it”. Similarly for short term/seasonal work, doing some should not result in losing benefits, as this does not help the beneficiary, nor the business that desparately needs people for 6 weeks work. Perhaps a few weeks work each year (say 6 or 8) could be exempt from income calculations in these cases? 8) While not entirely a tax issue, I recommend that we look at some way to encourage a more equitable society generally. This could be measures to limit the range of salaries in any organisation to (say as a start) 20 times (i.e. the CEO cannot earn more than 20 times the lowest paid person), or some form of basic income. It is recognised that more egalitarian societies do better on almost all measures of wellbeing than less egalitarian ones. ALL our systems should be good for people - if they aren’t, then why are we doing it that way ? Thanks again. :) Assumptions/principles: No one should pay more than 50% of their income (total) in tax. There should be an income level where you do pay 50%. :) Tax income is a “Public Good” which is often used to pay for “Public Bads” (eg cleaning up pollution). The more you earn the more tax you should pay. The more you own, the more you should pay (though people that own a lot but have no cash income could find this challenging). Perhaps there could be some kind of deferred liability at zero interest so that no cash is payable until the property is sold and cash is available ? Resource use should be taxed at source. Oil, gas, coal, water, everything that is extracted in some way and not then available for others to use. A carbon tax is the only fair way to encourage a reduction in carbon use - it’s clear that the ETS has not, does not and cannot work. Speculation adds nothing to NZ. Everyone should have enough to live on no matter their circumstances. This could be either a universal income (preferred), or no tax payable on the first X thousand dollars of income. Relying on income tax is a very limited (and some say decreasing) way of raising money for the public good. The tax base must be spread.

Dear Sirs, In regards to broadening the tax base, and also giving the Reserve Bank another inflation fighting tool, have you thought of a government imposed “premium” or levy on debt finance for residential investment properties? I believe that such a levy has some very interesting benefits for government revenues and the ability of the Reserve Bank in controlling inflation without unduly affecting productive investment or inadvertently increasing the exchange rate. What is it? I would suggest that the Governor of the Reserve Bank be given the power to impose a levy on all debt finance used to fund investment in residential properties. This would simply be a specified premium added on top of the interest rate for borrowings made to purchase residential investment property. This levy can be adjusted up or down, just as the Official Cash Rate is varied. What are the benefits? The beauty of it is that rather than just adjusting the OCR, you now have a “targeted tool” on a sector of the economy that can have a very significant impact on inflation, without affecting the rest of the productive economy. Also, rather than the banks and overseas investors benefiting from a higher OCR, the New Zealand Government benefits, in that the revenue generated by the levy can come into general government revenue. It is also very efficient in that the banks and finance companies collect the levy for the government, and there are very few “tax gatherers” involved. It also would help direct investors into more productive assets by increasing the cost of and risks associated with investment in residential property. Risk in that with the ability of the Reserve Bank to change the levy periodically, the residential property investor, even with a fixed rate mortgage, is now less certain of his future costs. Historically, with most people fixing mortgage rates, much of the economy was insulated from increases in the OCR and there was a significant delay in the effects of such increases. Another benefit is that house price inflation would be curbed, and more people would have the ability to buy that first home, since the levy would not be charged on one’s home. Why target residential property investment? Residential investment property is a very unique investment class. It is amazingly easy for anyone to get debt finance to purchase a residential investment property. Banks are very keen to lend, and the borrowers need quite a small percentage of the initial purchase price. In other words, it is just about the only class of investment where just about anyone can use financial leverage to increase wealth with no likely expectation of tax on capital gains, full tax deductibility of expenses, and little downside risk, and the lowest interest cost you can get for any investment. The banks would never lend on such terms to people for investment in shares for example. So this drives people to invest in residential property, which has a low benefit to the nation in terms of productive growth, hence skewing the nations investment profile towards low and non-productive assets. It also is a significant driver of inflation as more people chase residential investment property. This is just a broad outline, and I have worked my way through other issues related to this idea. If you are interested in the idea, please take it up, discuss it and feel free to use it. I would be happy to take time to pass on more about it if you would like. Thanks for taking the time to read it. Kindest Regards H. Bruce Clow, B.Sc. (Chem Eng) MBA \[1\]

Dr Chrys Horn To: Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz In summary, our tax system needs to be transitioning from mostly taxing income and all consumption to taxing wealth and consumption beyond basic items of food, housing etc. We need a tax system that supports innovation and green production and discourages rent seeking in which rentiers take money without contributing to any kind of production. This kind of activity has contributed to property speculation and means the wealthy continue to get wealthier at the cost of those who must sell their labour. In my view, speculation is a social and economic bad for the average New Zealander and should be discouraged. Our tax system should support all New Zealanders to get access to what they need to have decent, healthy, comfortable lives but not necessarily lives of luxury. Wealth inequality IS already an issue in New Zealand(regardless of how fast it is or isn’t growing, and how) and is accentuated by levels of debt that families now have to take on to buy houses or the high levels of rent people have to pay for their housing. Tax can and should encourage desired behaviours e.g.– healthier eating, cleaner production, reducing the use of plastic and fossil fuels, investment in research and innovation, less speculation in housing, building smaller houses and volunteering whilst discouraging undesirable, antisocial behaviours such as rent seeking, land banking, property speculation, luxury consumption, free riding, overuse of plastic packaging and pollution and loss of our air, water and soil resources. These are some thoughts: Tax ALL financial transactions A flat tax of 0.01% should be imposed on all financial transactions over $1000. including cryptocurrency transactions. This is easy to do and hard to dodge, does not include people paying for basics such as buying groceries, or paying rent at the lower end of the scale. Introduce wealth taxes A wealth tax should be paid and assessed yearly based on the amount of net wealth held by individuals, and companies:  0% below $1.2 million, \[1\]  1% between $1.2 million and 5 million;  2% exceeding $5 million. This would bring New Zealand into alignment with places such as Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France Belgium and the Netherlands. Introduce an Empty Homes Tax on residential properties in New Zealand cities that are unoccupied longer than 4 months annually. Consider taxing at a rate of 1% of the property’s assessed taxable value. We could require as they do in Vancouver that residential property owners submit an annual property status declaration. Keep what capital gains taxes we already have. It is good to keep that tax off the family home. Consider inheritance taxes. It seems appalling that people can inherit any amount without paying any tax and yet beneficiaries are “taxed” by having their benefit cut as soon as anyone gives them some kind of assistance or a birthday present of money (most of which are tiny by comparison to what happens with inheritances). If need be, put an amount on what people can inherit free of tax and tax in bands in the same way we tax income tax. A lack of inheritance taxes advantages the rich and helps to maintain social inequality. That should change. Income Tax Long term, look at minimising income tax for those below average (NOT median) incomes. At this stage, it should be feasible to tax income as follows:  Tax-free $0 to $14,000;  17.5%: $14,001 to $48,000;  30%: $48,001 to $70,00;  33% on $70,000 to $150,000;  39% from $150,000 to $1 million  49% over 1 million. This compares with top tax rates in Australia of 49%, USA of 46.9%, France of 54%, Denmark of 55.8% and the UK of 45%). No matter what, personal income tax already is hidden in trusts and a number of other mechanisms for those who can afford to pay tax professionals to do this. These kinds of dodges cannot be taken advantage of by those on lower incomes. Given that New Zealand has relatively high company tax and yet not very high personal income tax by comparison to the countries listed above, it would be good to look at how they manage tax sheltering behaviour adapt if for this country. Company Tax We need to ensure that that multinational tax avoiders operating in New Zealand pay tax here commensurate with the profit that they make from New Zealanders. To do this, we must ascertain New Zealand Company Tax on the portion of total revenue earned in New Zealand relative to their total international company profit. Impose a Revenue Tax of 6% on Digital Multinational Companies simlar to that being considered in the EU and which has been actioned by India) that have a turnover of more than New Zealand $1.3 billion and whose businesses depend on digital advertising, online marketplaces, including google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Uber & AirBnB, (https://www.stuff.co.New Zealand/business/industries/102407858/New Zealand-could- follow-europe-and-impose-revenue-tax-on-likes-of-google-and-facebook There may be a case to decrease the company tax rate, particularly for small businesses with small incomes. To a certain extent, it seems relatively easy for businesses to minimise profits already through a range of mechanisms that already exist, so I’m agnostic on this question but it also seems very reasonable to support small business wherever possible – it is often much more efficient and beneficial to the local economy that larger business and helps to circulate money in the local economy. To care for our health Consider taxes on sugar, tobacco, alcohol and excitotoxins such as glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine (although my personal view is that these last should actually be banned altogether from our food system, given the social cost of them In terms of how sick they make some people, and their effects on brain health and function). These should be flat taxes, across the board, all able to be raised to same rate as current tobacco tax. To Care for our Environment: This is of vital importance to get right. Our environment has been treated as a cash cow and the environmental and social costs of many activities are not factored into use costs of our collective activities. We must internalise many of the costs that have been externalised and which have led us to the environment crisis we now collectively face. New Zealand MUST take the lead in this. At present it lags behind much of the developed world. Ideas include  A Climate Change Levy similar to that imposed by the United Kingdom’s Climate Change Act 2008),  Improve the effectiveness of our Emissions Trading Scheme and or better still use a system of carbon taxes to collect money for initiatives to lessen our national reliance on fossil fuels and get our economy going, bring farmers and farming practice into this in stages.  Consider a landfill and waste tax similar to those in the UK and Germany.  Impose a nitrate fertiliser pollution levy at $2 per kilo of nitrate along with rebates rewarding tree planting, increasing biodiversity, & regenerative and organic agriculture  Impose a plastic bag tax 20 cents a bag at point of sale - to discourage use of single use plastics. Think about how to tax any single use plastic packaging and how this might be taxed at the point of production.  Take a Tourist Eco tax of $35 per person entering the country flat rate to be spent managing the resources that are used by tourists e.g.-national parks, beaches, campsites, toilets.  Impose a clean water royalty to be paid by all industrial and commercial consumers that impact on water quality. Longer term, consider how this might work for industrial consumers of water quantity.  Reduce GST to 10% at least on basic food items, because it disadvantages those on lower incomes. Extend GST to include items New Zealand consumers buy from international websites.  Place a tax on developers of greenfields around our cities, particularly where there are valuable horticultural soils, and provide tax breaks for the more complex brownfields developments needed to intensify housing in our cities and prevent the need for people to travel great distances just to get to work each day.  Our housing shortage is not a shortage per se, but a shortage of cheap housing. Developers are currently incentivised to build large and expensive houses and often use convenants to require new builds to be large when that might not be the choice of a new landowner. It would be good to tax the building of large houses, to make convenants on house size and cost illegal (or tax them to discourage it happening), and to provide tax breaks to developers for building smaller, cheaper houses.  Allow local councils beyond Auckland to impose regional petrol taxes to help with developing and encouraging the use of more efficient forms of transport that minimise the use of fossil fuels. This tax could also help contribute to health outcomes through getting people using more active forms of transport. Thanks for the opportunity to submit on this topic.

While not made as one with specific formal economic nor investment management qualifications, I have been motivated to write due to what I observe as serious and damaging distortions within the economy. I encourage the working group to make strong and robust recommendations that I believe are required to start New Zealand on a path that will eliminate the distortions within our taxation system that have and are contributing to serious problems in our economic performance, our long term social stability and our capacity as a nation to be economically resilient and dynamic. There are three broad areas I have focussed upon: 1. Rural land prices and the links between economic performance, productivity, resilience and environmental performance. And 2. Housing prices As above and, in part, related to the lack of taxation regimes related to land and assets. 3. Hypothecated Taxes Taxation regimes to either promote behaviour change, catalyse the capacity to make economic principles drive socially or environmentally necessary outcomes, or to fund the costs required to avoid or remediate the effects of unwanted outcomes. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Fundamental Philosophy: The above issues have been the subject to repeated and in depth commentary in many forms by many economists in recent years, both nationally and internationally. However, in terms of national debate, the underlying core information has been poorly socialised and usually ensnared in a shallow politically branded left or right wing debate. For the record, I am very much of the side that markets can and do effectively drive rapid responses to evolving situations. However, I am also very much of the view that most markets operate with incomplete information and within the construct of a framework. If the framework is wrong, the 2 markets can very efficiently deliver the wrong result for society at large, (NZ Inc) in this case. I believe this is where we are now at in NZ in relation to the issues listed. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 Rural Land Pricing As a practicing forestry professional, (currently Environment Manager for a large NZ Forestry Company) I have been involved in not only day to day issues of forestry, but also in land use and land management issues in many parts of NZ, environmental issues related to Carbon / climate change, Nitrogen / water quality, biodiversity protection etc. It has become very apparent that tax distortions are having a (possibly significant) part to play in why we have had, and continue to have, some of the land use and economic efficiency issues we face today. By way of example: • Commercial plantation forestry occupies approx. 1.7million ha while the drystock pastoral sector around 10million ha. • Forestry is known to produce in Net Present Value terms around 2 or more times the average of drystock farming. In a presentation I prepared for the NZ institute of Forestry in 2013, I estimated (from Treasury and Infometrics data) that forestry was producing several times the GDP contribution per occupied hectare relative to drystock farming (see table below). • Furthermore, using published data from model farm statistics, it was apparent that large areas of NZ pastoral farming was making a return on capital employed of around 1.5% and at the time such figures were not atypical over a number of years past. Over the same period in the same area there had been effectively no new forest planting. • Using a spatial economic model developed by Scion (forest research CRI), farm values were reconfigured to represent the value that could be supported if farm returns of 8% pre-tax on capital employed were being sought, a level similar to that required for forest investment at the time. The result was dramatic. The land values had to drop significantly to support that level of return on the farm and in so doing, forestry also became highly competitive - indicating a potential for economically afforestable land to rise from 0% to 40% of the landscape. 3 • The figures as calculated did not include payments for Carbon. These would have further improved returns to a level completely out of reach of the drystock pastoral sector on similar land. • The results are illustrated in the maps below. Forestry NPV’s at 8% pre-tax and (then) present pastoral land values with farms in the area broadly making an average of 1.5% ROI Forestry NPV’s at 8% pre-tax after pastoral land values adjusted downward to enable farms to achieve the same 8% return. Key – Lime green colour through to blue –NPVs’ >$0 /ha The Problem • Despite the highlighted disparity, the problem of inflated land values has continued. A study undertaken in 2015 1 by agronomists indicated drystock farm values had continued to increase and that the closest correlation to that trend was the trend in Dairy land prices, not the value generated from the businesses themselves nor the market prices of the meat or wool they sold. • Over the same period – NZ has in effect, been disinvesting in forestry, as new planting largely ceased and replanting declined to provide for conversion of forest land to (usually dairy) use. • There has been extensive commentary in the last five years, recognising: o The high levels of debt in the dairy sector. o The fact that farm valuations were heavily driven by the factors of stock numbers or KG’s milk solids per hectare produced with little evaluation of the costs of producing the marginal added Kg milk solids. This has occurred to the extent that many dairy farms were now actually less profitable and more vulnerable than prior to expansion and intensification. However, the land values had continued to climb, at least until the 2015 slump. 1 The Effect of Environmental Constraints on Land Prices Phil Journeaux, AgFirst Waikato Ltd 2015 4 o Hand in hand with this expansion and intensification has been the rise of carbon emissions, serious nitrate leaching and water provisioning issues. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Submission It is hard not to conclude that in the drive to achieve land value appreciation (and tax free capital gain), New Zealand has become good at farming “land value” but at a national level this may have resulted in extensive misdirected investment of scarce financial resources, poorly distributed wealth and less wealth overall as a nation. A direct consequence of that focus has also been vulnerability with high levels of debt associated leveraged investment in patches of dirt and, in lieu of sufficiently robust environmental regulatory controls, poor environmental outcomes borne by all New Zealanders. I strongly support moves to adjust taxation regimes to remove the inherent incentives leading to what is a potentially toxic combination that is already extremely difficult to deconstruct. If not done, then in the medium to long term the consequence could be self-defeating as land values increase costs so far that the artificially created alternative products that are already appearing on supermarket shelves eventually undermine a significant part of the whole rationale for the current pastoral farming models. Removal of the latent incentives to capitalise value to land for tax free capital gain will also almost invariably lead to adjustments that may also see more afforestation occurring without further significant Government (taxpayer) support. Given the current realignment of policy objectives to achieve decarbonisation in the economy, afforestation as a least cost option is desirable but difficult in the face of current land values. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 5 2 Rental Property & House Prices. The issue of housing price inflation, in part, mirrors much of that already noted above. While undoubtedly, a shortage of supply is a major component of price escalation it seems fairly well established that: • In recent years a very large proportion of purchasers have been “investors”, • “Negative gearing” and heavy leveraging have been standard and in fact often widely, encouraged strategies to get into housing investment, • The availability of cheap credit has particularly advantaged those with existing asset bases. • Extensive coverage given to the issue by competent economics commentators has repeatedly highlighted that damaging risks posed by the current taxation regime. It is hard not to conclude that the taxation regime in relation to housing investment is a contributing factor to the serious house price inflation witnessed over recent years. The social and health consequences of that inflation, combined with trends toward less stable employment are becoming obvious to all and can only ultimately feed through to very high economic costs to mitigate the problems that have arisen. The mantra that landlords provide an essential service may well be true if they were building new houses to rent. Clearly however, a very large proportion are not, they are simply buying existing houses, providing no greater or lesser service than would accrue to the first home buyer purchasing the same building for their own use. The difference is they can use the current tax regime to support higher pricing and sustained cashflow losses or very poor returns that no other business could, all on the basis that there will be tax free capital gain at the end. The public discussion on this issue has always been highly emotional, particularly from those invested in the benefits that have accrued. Seriously deficient has been the requisite balancing component to the discussion – being that a capital or land tax or better still a capital income tax does not have to be an added tax in aggregate in the economy. What it should be is a tax, closing a gap that has allowed many to (legally) avoid paying tax. Once in place, the broader tax base should provide for income based tax reductions. This is most likely to most benefit those in lower and middle incomes (who will nevertheless spend most of it) and or offset increased rental costs that could arise as those still operating as landlords seek to get an appropriate return on capital given that capital appreciation is no longer advantaged. It may well be that in the short term real rents will rise, but longer term (as has already been reported in Auckland and Rotorua), the threat of tighter standards and possible tax changes is seeing some landlords exit and lower investor activity being replaced by more first home buyers. This in itself has to be an improvement even if the rental situation remains tight. However, if in addition, proposed levels of house construction are implemented, the capacity for rents to inflate will also be curtailed. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 6 Submission While there may be a case to provide limited time bound tax breaks for the bringing to market of “new housing”, the ownership of rental accommodation needs to be clearly defined as a business. The capacity of offset losses against other unassociated income – particularly sustained losses which no other rational nor productive business would do, needs to be curtailed. The effects of rampant house price inflation pose threats to the wider public through risks to economic stability, misdirected investment and social dislocation. Capital and income taxes need to be aligned with other economic business activity to curb (as with rural land) the incentives to invest substantial proportions of the nation’s capital into what are fundamentally unproductive and speculative enterprise with significant downside costs to wider society. I strongly support moves to adjust taxation regimes to remove the current distortions that in-part are fuelling the relatively extreme rise in housing costs in many parts of NZ. It is unacceptable the long term social and economic costs and risks created and borne across wider society can continue through the favoured treatment of housing taxation that in effect is a means of tax avoidance that has and does promote asset wealth amongst a relative few. Similarly, is undesirable that so much of the Nation’s capital continues to be invested in static and unproductive assets. Such diversion will not support a prosperous, dynamic and innovative economy in the long term. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 7 3 Tax Regimes to achieve general public benefit. Over the years through my involvement in the various landuse, environmental and resource use debates it has become very obvious that: 1. Across a wide range of issues, getting change in directions we all recognise are needed is often very difficult to initiate if market signals are not strong or clear enough. Recycling would be a typical situation. It is ironic that while there is a large debate about the rights and wrongs of bottling free water, no one much is also talking about the enormous carbon footprint being created by the massive use of fossil fuel based plastics and the transport of that water around the world, let alone the incomplete recycling infrastructure we have in the domestic scene. Reinstating the simple concept of surcharges and refunds (as well established in Norway and other developed economies) needs to be integrated more thoroughly into our economy to start to drive the improvements required in so many areas of this far from clean and green nation. 2. As illustrated in the recent dairy boom and consequential mass conversion of forests, if the framework within which the economic signals are given is wrongly structured, responses to such signals can be powerful and far faster than regulation can ever hope to keep up. There is a strong case that had the costs of Nitrogen and Carbon emissions been factored in, many of the conversions would never have happened. Pricing externalities where these are directly attributable is likely to be a far faster and more robust mechanism to achieve change than the grinding wheels of the RMA or other rules will ever hope to achieve. The complete failure of this 20+ year old Act to achieve let alone maintain water quality is testament to this as is the rapid but temporary response of new forest planting with the introduction of the ETS. Just as suddenly as new planting restarted it subsequently stopped having been completely undermined by the importation of “low grade hot air emissions credits” in order to avoid costs sheeting home to the main emitting sources. 3. Hypothecated taxes: increased use of taxes directly connected to the costs of reducing or remediating a problem seems to be a tool far too sparsely used at present, yet the areas in which they might be effective are substantial. The power to reduce the socialisation of costs associated with specific actions of forms of consumption thus alleviating the need for as much expenditure from general taxation seem to be an opportunity missed. The arguments of the benefits or otherwise in relation to a sugar tax seem to be a classic case where political motivations and vested interests deliberately obfuscate the debate to the disadvantage of society as a whole. It is very clear that excess sugar in our diets is creating a massive current and future health liability compounding the future costs that will already be imposed upon younger generations faced with an increasing ageing population. The public debate around this issue was managed to focus on disputed evidence of whether a sugar tax would reduce sugar consumption. In reality this is irrelevant, the sugar is creating harm and a tax will have some uncertain impact along a continuum between no effect and completely ending the consumption of products with added sugar. The exact 8 quantum does not matter – what matters is that the greater the consumption, the greater the tax take and consequential redirection of the hypothecated funds to the health and education sectors. The inverse also applies. Additionally, if the tax is of sufficient size it is likely to motivate those involved in the manufacture of highly sugared products to start lowering content to remain cost competitive, thus reducing the latent impact of these products upon society at large. Provided the associated regulatory frameworks are also sound in relation to the safety and labelling of alternative food additives that might be added to reduce direct sugar content, there must be an overall benefit. International Tourism may well be another case where simply administered border charges could be used to reinvest into the regional infrastructure to manage the now patently adverse effects of the currently burgeoning tourist numbers - not to mention actually assisting in the protection of the biodiversity assets of the current conservation estate that are presently funded solely by the NZ Taxpayer. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Submission I strongly support moves to make much greater use of targeted tax tools to drive behaviour change either through taxation of unwanted outcomes or redistribution tax takes to incentivise desired behaviours. In particular I support increased use of hypothecated taxes. There is however, a desperate need to properly socialise the discussion around such taxes so the public at large understand that the finance raised is ring fenced and fed back directly to solving or reducing recognised problems. On that basis it is hard to imagine that there could not be achieved a significant acceptance of the purpose and value that can be derived from the targeted implementation of such taxes. The current response to the fuel tax in Auckland would seem to be a case in point where despite some issues of fairness at the margin, the general tenor after the announcement of the tax has been one of acceptance and the greater good that will arise from a much enlarged transport infrastructure spend on both roads and importantly, public transport. The tax working group should strive to identify and publish a target list of key areas where hypothecated or other targeted taxation should be applied to achieve better outcomes for the nation. To bring such a list into the public domain may then provide the foundation from which public and political debate can launch. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 9 In Conclusion: It is my strong belief that the consequences of identifiable failings in the current taxation system in NZ have provided for structural distortions that are destructive to the future social, economic and environmental resilience of the nation. The distortions have become deeply embedded and strongly politicised in the national psyche. Unravelling the in-built consequences of these distortions will not be without pain. BUT, as a still small nation we can change more easily than most if the initial decisions are made with some urgency. This review, in my view, provides a desperately needed opportunity to start the process of change, a change that can steer the country in a direction that points to a stronger, richer, socially more balanced and environmentally more resilient nation.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. To the Tax Working Group, I am writing to outline my perspective on the current tax system along with my recommendations for change. Background It is my opinion that the biggest challenges facing New Zealand are income and wealth inequality. Since the 1980s, the incomes of the highest 1% of the population have doubled, while the lowest 10% have barely experienced any wage growth over the same period \[1\]. Over the same period, personal and company income tax rates have been reduced \[2\], which in part has fuelled the rising inequality that we see today. Ongoing developments in digitisation and automation pose a threat where wages are further suppressed \[3\], and a very small group of individuals derive enormous wealth by harnessing new technologies \[4\]. Rising inequality threatens the wellbeing of New Zealanders. Thus, it is imperative that the current level of inequality is reduced. Another important challenge is the distortion induced by the failure of markets to account for negative externalities. Noteworthy examples include the consumption of fossil fuels, unhealthy food, and gambling. Each of these items has a significant level of associated harm, yet consumers and vendors are not always liable for payment of these costs. An excellent example of including negative externalities is the tax on tobacco \[5, 6\], where the revenue derived may cover the costs incurred by those afflicted by tobacco smoking. More work needs to be done to account for negative externalities in other areas. Finally, I believe our tax system is unfairly geared towards religious organisations. A registered charity must meet the definition of “charitable purpose”, which includes “the advancement of religion” \[7\]. This definition is inappropriate considering that some religious groups are responsible for social harms, such as the marginalisation of minority groups, and using tithes to fund the lavish lifestyles of church leaders. The tax system’s favouritism towards religious groups is incompatible with the egalitarian values of an increasingly secular New Zealand. Given these challenges, how can the tax system be changed to prepare New Zealand for the future? My recommendations are as follow: 1). Introduction of additional income brackets with higher marginal rates. This policy will curb the rapid rise in inequality that New Zealand has experienced during the past 35 years. It serves to counteract the increasingly absurd occurrences of CEOs receiving exorbitant salaries and unjustifiable bonuses. I believe that there is also scope to reduce the marginal rates on lower income brackets to increase the take-home pay of low income New Zealanders. 2). Introduction of a 100% inheritance tax on all inheritances above $500,000. Intergenerational wealth transfer is deeply unmeritocratic and only serves to entrench inequality. An Inheritance tax enhances social mobility and improves outcomes for New Zealanders on low incomes. A distinction should be made between middle income inheritors and heirs to multimillion dollar fortunes, hence the provision of the $500,000 threshold. Regrettably, the Tax Working Group has defined income tax rises and inheritance taxes as beyond its scope. However, I see my recommendations as instrumental in returning inequality to a tolerable, pre- 1980s level. 3). A carbon tax on the sale of all non-renewable fuels. Fossil fuels currently enjoy an unfair cost advantage relative to clean energy technology since the negative environmental impacts are not included in the retail price. The government is well-placed to impose these costs on consumers and by doing so will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to clean technology. Advancing clean technology is vital for humanity to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 4). Remove “the advancement of religion” from the definition of charitable purpose by amending the Charities Act (2005). Advancing religion is not compatible with the more widely understood definition of charity (i.e. good deeds). Removing this definition would also remove a loophole by which corporations may avoid paying tax on their profits, and by doing so gain an undue advantage over their competitors \[8\]. I would like to extend my thanks to the Tax Working Group for inviting New Zealanders to offer contributions towards reforming the tax system.

Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 1 Submission to the Tax Working Group 27 April 2018 Personal submission from David Grimmond Summary My recommendation is that the Tax Working Group seriously considers the option of New Zealand replacing its porous income tax system with a comprehensive expenditure tax system based on the existing GST infrastructure. That is, remove all forms of income tax and increase the rate of GST in order to meet government revenue requirements. Issues of vertical equity and income redistribution could be addressed via the benefit system, for example through some universal income entitlement and/or a targeted benefit system. A comprehensive expenditure tax system would be more transparent, equitable, economically efficient, and administratively simple than the current mixed income-expenditure tax system. Independent of this recommendation, but critical should a greater emphasis on expenditure taxes be adopted, is the recommendation that the GST system in New Zealand should be switched from its current destination basis onto an origins basis. This would remove an existing distortion whereby the implementation of GST promotes returns for goods exporting activities at the expense of service export activities (eg education, tourism). In so doing it would also potentially promote a more environmentally friendly production mix and better future proof the tax system against the growth of E-commerce. If New Zealand chooses to persist with an income tax system, it is vital that the tax system addresses the current favourable status of home ownership. My recommendation would be to introduce a tax on imputed rent. If such a tax was coupled with a tax deduction for mortgage interest payments, then this would reduce the current tax-based inducement for home owners to rapidly pay down their mortgage. The net impact will be to diversify people’s savings portfolios and increase capital available for investment in the business sector. is that people currently some form of addressing the inequity in tax treatments . the absence of \[1\] Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 2 Contents Submission to the Tax Working Group ................................................................................... 1 Summary................................................................................................................................. 1 1.

COMPREHENSIVE EXPENDITURE TAX SYSTEM My preference for a comprehensive expenditure tax system relates to my interpretation of the optimal tax literature and in particular issues relating to the appropriate tax on capital. The appropriate tax on capital Optimal tax literature suggests that it is probably inappropriate to tax capital. I will provide more detail below, but the gist of the argument was captured by Thomas Hobbes view that a person should be taxed “by what he takes out of the common pool, not by what he puts into it” (quoted in Musgrave 1957). Theory Theoretical analysis of the appropriate tax on capital is that it should probably not be taxed, and that a tax on capital is unlikely to serve either efficiency or redistributive purposes. Mankiw, Weinzierl, and Yagan (2009) note that this result, controversial from its beginning in the mid-1980s, has been modified in some subtle ways, and challenged in others, but its strong underlying logic has made it the benchmark. The subtleties mentioned do not overturn the view that the optimal level of taxes on capital should be near zero, but rather as noted by Auerbach (2006a): “a capital income subsidy is just as likely to be optimal as a capital income tax” (p21). The logic for near zero capital taxes is based on the observations that: • the supply of capital is highly responsive to changes in the cost of capital, • capital taxes produce large distortions in consumption decisions, and hence discourage saving, • capital taxes also produce large distortions in the funding of different capital projects, and • as capital accumulation is central to the creation of aggregate output, this has sizeable impacts on economic growth prospects. The nature of capital is that it tends to be long lived, specialised to the production of dedicated outputs, large and lumpy in size and cost, and intertwined with the organisation of surrounding economic activity. This nature of capital increases the importance of tax distortions on investment decisions. As Auerbach and Hines (2001) note, capital taxation is extremely distortionary even at very low rates of tax as the intertemporal nature of investment decisions means that the wedge imposed by taxes on capital grows over time. The misallocation of resources resulting from a tax distorting capital decisions compounds over time. Mankiw, Weinzierl, and Yagan (2009) note that the intuition of zero capital taxes can be developed in a number of ways: 1. The seminal paper by Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) indicates that the optimal tax on all intermediate goods is zero. This is because taxes on intermediate Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 4 inputs of production will distort the allocation of factor inputs. Likewise taxes on corporate accounting profits will distort the return on capital for a subset of the economy, encouraging capital to leave the corporate sector. Likewise human and physical capital should not be taxed as both are used as inputs to future production, so taxing them would put the economy inside its production frontier. 2. A tax on capital is effectively a tax on future consumption, but not on current consumption, and this would violate the Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976) prescription that all commodities should be taxed uniformly 1 . In fact, a capital tax imposes an ever-increasing tax on consumption further in the future, so its violation of the principle of uniform commodity taxation is extreme. 3. Based on Chamley 2 (1986) and Judd 3 (1985), there will exist households with long planning horizons that will determine how much they will save based on their discounting of the future and the return on capital in the economy. In the long run, their saving decisions will be perfectly elastic with respect to the after- tax rate of return. Thus any tax on capital income will leave the desired after-tax return to capital unchanged, which means that the pre-tax return to capital must rise, which will reduce the size of the capital stock and aggregate output below potential. This distortion is so large as to make any capital income taxation suboptimal, even from the perspective of an individual with no savings. 4 This third argument is strengthened by globalisation of capital markets, which can lead to highly elastic responses of capital flows to tax changes even in the short run. The logic remains the same, but rather than changing saving/investment decisions over time, global investors adjust their portfolio geographically to maximise their after-tax return on investment. An implication of the Chamley argument is that by reducing investment, the incidence of capital taxes can ultimately hit labour income by reducing job opportunities. That is, investors will reduce their investments in certain areas if they are adversely affected by capital taxes, which will reduce job opportunities for workers. In an efficient labour market this will translate into slower wage growth rather than fewer jobs, but the implication 1 Atkinson, A. B. and J. E. Stiglitz, 1976, “The design of the tax structure: Direct versus indirect taxation,” Journal of Public Economics 6, 55–75. The original Atkinson-Stiglitz thesis was made using a number of restrictive assumptions, but the results appear to continue to hold when these judgements are relaxed see for example Hellwig (2008). 2 Chamley C (1986) “Optimal Taxation of Capital Income in General Equilibrium with Infinite Lives”, Econometrica, Vol 54(3) pp 607-622 3 Judd K L (1985) “Redistributive Taxation in a Simple Perfect Foresight Model”, Journal of Public Economics, Vol 28, pp 59-83 4 As with the Atkinson and Stiglitz results, the original Chamley and Judd papers made use of a number of restrictive assumptions. Likewise subsequent investigations relaxing these assumptions appear to confirm the original finding. For example, Atkeson, Chari and Kehoe (1999) find that the Chamley (1986) result that the optimal tax rate on capital income is zero continues to hold when the analytical model is generalised so that agents are heterogeneous (rather than identical), economic growth is modelled endogenously (rather than exogenously), and with overlapping generations (rather than living forever). Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 5 remains that the buck stops with workers, not investors. It is this implication that leads to the result that capital taxes are not only harmful to aggregate economic prospects, but are also unlikely to provide an effective means of income redistribution. Implications for taxing labour Both Ljungqvist and Sargent (2000) and Auerbach and Hines (2001) report that an extension of the arguments for not taxing capital implies that labour income should also not be taxed. This is because labour is also an intermediate input into the production process and thus any tax on labour will also distort production decisions. Since labour income taxes effectively tax intertemporal labour/leisure choices, the optimal dynamic tax path is one in which labour income taxes are zero. There is also the added issue of human capital accumulation, which means that the arguments about the compounding of tax distortions over time for physical capital are also likely to apply for skill development. The seminal article in this area is Jones, Manuelli and Rossi 5 (1997) which shows that a zero tax also applies to labour income: that is, the return on human capital should not be taxed; instead the government should resort to a consumption tax. Auerbach and Hines (2001) argue that an alternative to a zero tax on labour would be to make spending on education tax deductible. However, Hellwig (2008) shows that this result stems from a special case of the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem, and that a generalisation of the model structure re-confirms the view that one should not tax income, although an argument for some form of subsidy on education can still hold. The idea of taxing consumption rather than income has a long history, dating back to at least the 17 th Century quote of Thomas Hobbes and it is also frequently credited to John Stuart Mill (Ballard et al 1985). The arguments for a consumption tax include: • It is more reasonable to tax withdrawals from the economic system than on additions to the system (as argued by Hobbes) • Income taxes distort intertemporal consumption decisions: saving must be made out of net-of-tax income, and the earnings of investments are further taxed before future consumption can occur. • Administrative efficiency and lower compliance costs: no need to separate income into labour, corporate, capital gains, welfare transfers; nor the calculation of depreciation allowances, fringe benefits, imputed rents. • It removes the tax wedge distorting investment decisions. • Consumption is a better measure of the ability to pay The last point involves a number of important points relating to the preference of taxation systems. A key principle underlying tax systems is that their design should reflect people’s ability to pay. Not taking into account people’s ability to pay is the critical failing of lump- 5 Jones L E, Manuelli R E, and Rossi P E (1997) “On the Optimal Taxation of Capital Income”, Journal of Economic Theory, Vol 73(1), pp 93-117 Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 6 sum taxes. Consumption is considered by many to be better than income as a measure of ability to pay (eg see Pechman 1990 or Metcalf 1994). This reflects the permanent income consumption hypothesis that people smooth consumption through swings in year to year income levels based on their longer term income expectations, which reflect life-cycle considerations (eg one’s income might be low in old age, but wealth accumulation may mean that one may still have a high level of consumption spending). Real world issues It is impossible to produce a perfect tax system. Actual tax systems result from compromising different aims (eg raising revenue, protecting economic efficiency, reflecting ability to pay, and income redistribution goals) and the balance between such aims depend on the values and judgements of both the designers and society in general. The implication is that the benchmark for judging tax systems can be argued to be existing systems rather than some theoretical ideal. In particular one needs to recognise that: • Taxation is a system of coercively collecting revenues from individuals who will tend to resist (Slemrod 1990). • Changes in tax policy must pass a political as well as an economic test (Hettich and Winer 1988). • As reforms in one part of the system may lead to unexpected repercussions elsewhere as the government attempts to establish a new equilibrium, there is likely to be a political bias favouring the status quo (Creedy 2010). The implication is that substantive tax reform typically has to pass a very high hurdle. Another implication is that tax reform is path dependent – the options available depend on previous tax design and the mandate government has for reform. The pre-conditions for comprehensive reforms to the tax system come along rarely, and are typically associated with political and social upheaval. An example of this is that the adoption of flat tax systems is largely limited to eight newly independent Central and Eastern European countries in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union (Rabushka 2005). Another implication is that a lack of political will, rather than any technical issues, is often the main obstacle preventing the adoption of wealth enhancing tax reforms. The bias towards the status quo also means that adjustments to the tax system tend to be incremental and ad hoc. As a result there is also a tendency for tax systems to become increasingly complicated. The resulting build-up in exemptions, allowances, and attempts to close loop holes have the perverse effects of encouraging tax arbitrage that erode the tax base. It is worth noting that income taxes are a relatively modern phenomenon. All income tax systems have emerged since the initial introduction in Prussia and Saxony in the second half of the 19 th Century. While tax rates were initially set at low levels, the degree of progressivity sharply increased in the first half of the 20 th Century. Saez (2002) argues that income taxes were designed to have their strongest impact on the top income earners, the vast majority of whose income comes from capital. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 7 Thus a key purpose of modern tax systems appears to be to redistribute accumulated wealth. That is, if the primary aim is to raise revenue, the secondary one is to redistribute income. But are progressive income tax systems efficient and effective ways of achieving these ends? Not if the rich can effectively reduce their tax liability, and not if the imposition of taxes leads to economic inefficiencies that reduce prospects for economic growth and the purchasing power of incomes. The optimal tax analysis presented above also indicates that taxes on capital are not necessarily effective in redistributing wealth as any initial gains will eventually be offset by reduced job opportunities and wage prospects for workers. This is further compounded if the wealthy can find effective ways of minimising their tax liabilities. The use of incomes as the base of tax systems that also have a primary aim of redistributing income has resulted in most OECD countries adopting what OECD (2006) characterises as semi-comprehensive income tax systems. Comprehensive incomes can be defined as the amount that can be consumed without reducing wealth (Creedy 2010). This definition implies that a comprehensive income tax system should tax capital gains. In addition rental income from home ownership should be imputed for tax purposes and mortgage interest payments should be deductible (OECD 2006). The notional nature of capital gains and imputed rentals make these factors difficult to calculate and tax accurately, tending to result in gaps in the comprehensive income tax base of most countries. Gaps in the tax base both open up tax arbitrage opportunities and encourage increasingly complicated tax systems as ad hoc adjustments are made to plug holes in the tax base. Indeed OECD (2006) reports that the main complexities in tax systems arise from the definition of the tax base (eg whether the income in question is taxable or not, along with the use of special tax rates, tax allowances, and tax credits) and not so much from the tax rate structure (p44). The problems of tax arbitrage behaviour have led to reforms in many countries which have attempted to broaden the tax base and lower tax rates. This potentially lowers the efficiency costs resulting from relying heavily on taxing incomplete assessments of taxable income. However, the optimal tax theory results imply that even very small taxes on capital income can result in distortions in economic decisions that compound over time resulting in large welfare losses. Indeed one of the implications of optimal tax theory is that the optimal tax on capital is not necessarily zero if there is not a “complete set of flat-rate taxes” (Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2000, p324). If there are activities that escape the tax base, then an optimal tax system would introduce taxes on capital to correct for this distortion. However, the optimal capital tax is only positive if the untaxed activity (or factor) complements taxed activities; if they are substitutes the optimal policy would be to subsidise the taxed activity (or factor). This result would argue, for example, for the imposition of a tax on equipment for the cultivation and manufacture of illegal drugs (which are not taxed), but a subsidy on equipment used in the provision of other, non-drug related, leisure activities. A flat tax system, without a tax on capital would seem to be a simpler approach at promoting economic efficiency. Any income redistribution aims can still be achieved via government spending policies. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 8 Attributes of a comprehensive expenditure tax system Tax Base The aim of a comprehensive expenditure tax system is to tax final consumption expenditure based on a value added tax like GST. A key finding of optimal tax theory is that the optimal tax on intermediate goods is zero (Diamond and Mirrlees 1971). Value added taxes like GST, which apply the tax at every transaction, but allow registered producers to claim back the taxes paid on purchased inputs, conform with this principle. All taxes represent the coercive collection of revenue from people who will tend to resist, primarily by avoiding the activity being taxed. This natural resistance to paying tax imposes costs on society either directly (via the cost of administering and policing the tax) or indirectly (via the distortion to efficient behaviour). Consideration of these factors leads to the rule of thumb that expenditure taxes should cover as wide a range of activities as possible to reduce opportunities for people to avoid paying the tax and hence also minimise the distortions to behaviour induced by the tax. This system would incorporate the abolition of income taxes. A consumption tax can be shown to be equivalent to a wage tax, at least over the long term. The critical factor with a comprehensive expenditure tax compared with an income tax system is that it does not tax capital income. The non-tax of capital is also consistent with optimal tax theory: capital equipment is an intermediate input to the production of future output so a tax on capital on income violates the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) thesis that intermediate goods should not be taxed; the different capital requirements for producing different goods and services means that the presence of capital income taxes will influence the after tax return of different investment opportunities and so will distort investment decisions. The long run revenue equivalence of comprehensive expenditure tax and flat tax systems means that ease of implementation and the timing of tax incidence become critical criteria for comparing the two systems. Summers (1981) argues that an expenditure tax base has positive growth benefits as it encourages greater saving at younger ages 6 . 6 A tax that targets consumption spending and omits savings from the tax base can be shown to raise the same revenue as a tax applying only to labour income and exempting all property income. For example, using a simple two period model with constant interest rates, no gifts or bequests, and thus assumes that all savings from the first period needs to be consumed in the second period then saving in the first period is wage income not consumed: ݏ ଵ ݓ = ଵ ܿ− ଵ Consumption in the second period is wage income in the second period plus savings and the income earned with those savings, ie: ܿ ଶ ݓ= ଶ + ( ݎ+1 ) ݏ ଵ The net present value of lifetime consumption is thus: ܸܲܰ ( ܿ ) ܿ= ଵ + ܿ ଶ ( ݎ+1 ) ݓ= ଵ ݏ− ଵ + ݓ ଶ + ( ݎ+1 ) ݏ ଵ (1+ݎ) ݓ= ଵ + ݓ ଶ (1+ݎ) Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 9 GST in New Zealand is raised on a destination basis, which taxes imports and zero-rates exports. In practice it is very difficult to zero rate service exports such as tourism or education, and this will have distorted investment decisions constraining the service export sector. Increasing the importance of GST will accentuate this problem, but we argue that it can be circumvented by converting GST onto an origins basis (see Argument for designing GST based on the origin principle on page 19). Rate structure On balance, an equal tax rate for all goods, services, and transactions appears the appropriate rate structure for a comprehensive expenditure tax system, but this follows as much from practical considerations as from conceptual considerations. A flat tax structure is eases administration and compliance costs, and will also offer horizontal equity properties. A universal rate may not necessarily be optimal from an economic efficiency perspective. This reflects that taxing spending will encourage activities that do not require spending (eg growing your own vegetables). Differential rates that tax complements to these self help activities at a higher rate (eg higher rates on seeds) are potentially more efficient. Even if it was possible to implement an optimally graduated expenditure tax system, the added complications to the overall system would probably negate any resulting benefits. The removal of income taxes would require a large increase in the GST rate compared with current levels. Simply covering current government revenue requirements would suggest a GST rate of around 45% would be warranted. However, this estimate is potentially on the high side. People continue to pay expenditure taxes long after their income taxes shrink to minimal levels. Thus expenditure tax rates set to meet the government's inter-temporal budget constraint can be set lower than the equivalent wage based tax rate as the tax base is based on whole of life spending which is typically longer than the working life. Special provisions There does not appear to be an obvious way for treating financial services within a value added tax system. In one sense taxing financial services could be seen as taxing future consumption and so should be excluded from the tax. In another sense financial services do offer services that add value here and now (eg peace of mind, the ability to smooth consumption, manage cash flows efficiently). From a purely practical perspective, financial service transactions do not fit the credit-invoice system used in GST and other value added tax systems very easily. For example, revenue is often raised as the margin between deposit and lending interest rates or buy and sell exchange rates. Thus applying the same tax rate would yield the same amount of revenue (or lifetime consumption) whether wage income or consumption is taxed. Summers (1981) demonstrates that this result can be generalised, but notes that there is no reason for the tax collection to be the same in any given period. Indeed because consumption taxes continue to extract revenue beyond retirement age, a consumption tax system encourages more saving in younger years and so encourages earlier capital accumulation and economic growth. Considered from an open economy perspective the Summers results imply that wage taxation encourages debt financing, which might not decrease investment, but it raises the risk profile of a given level of investment. Thus the increase in capital accumulation expected under a consumption tax comes from a lower national (currency) risk premium, which reduces the cost of capital to investors and raises investment levels. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 10 The approach that New Zealand has adopted to dealing with this issue is to exempt financial services from GST. This effectively treats financial service providers as final consumers: they pay GST on their inputs but do not charge GST on their services and cannot claim back GST like other businesses. In the retail market, this does not cause major problems, financial businesses will recoup their GST expense by charging clients more. The clients actually obtain a net benefit as they do not pay GST on the value added by financial service companies. There are other problems, however, which will be accentuated with an increase in the GST rate. The exemption creates a risk of tax cascades if the direct client is a business (the business client will effectively pay the GST, but cannot claim it back, so it will be passed on with an additional GST component to the final customer). In addition the exemption will encourage financial service companies to in-source key activities that they might otherwise have purchased from a separate entity. There does not appear to be a clear cut solution to this issue (see Inland Revenue Department 2002). More work would need to be done here before a comprehensive expenditure tax system could be introduced. A cursory examination of the issue would suggest that an option that would warrant further examination would be to zero-rate financial services, where no tax is paid on the supplies of financial services, and a full refund is given for GST paid in making those supplies. This would lower the government’s revenue base, but it would remove both the cascade and in-source problems. It would also be simpler to administer than other solutions suggested in Inland Revenue Department (2002). Revenue capability VAT/GST type taxes are common. As of 2004, 134 countries relied on value-added taxes as a substantial source of funding. VAT rates 20% plus in 20 countries. No country relies exclusively on spending taxes for revenue, the highest in 2004 was Iceland at 29.7% of revenue. New Zealand collected 24.7% of tax revenue through its GST in 2004 (Hines 2007). Expenditure taxes cover much of the grey economy and may even entice registration and identification of illegal activities. Although an expenditure tax will not stop hard core criminal activities, shifting the tax base away from incomes onto spending means that there is at least an opportunity to tax their ill-gotten gains. Administration costs The collection costs for British VAT has been estimated at about 3% of revenue raised (Slemrod 1990). Value added taxes have a large fixed cost setting up the appropriate collection systems so the collection cost per dollar raised falls as tax rates increase. The New Zealand GST is a simpler system than the British VAT, so collection costs for GST are likely to be proportionally lower. VATs are largely self-enforcing. The biggest risk is at the retail end where as much as half the tax base can be compromised. Slemrod quotes Hemming and Kay (1981) estimated that evasion of UK VAT was 1.5% of potential revenue. This level of tax evasion is very low compared with income tax evasion and avoidance, which has been estimated to exceed 10% Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 11 of potential revenue (Slemrod 1990). However, an increase in the GST rate will increase incentives to evade the tax. It is likely that more resources will be required to police a higher GST, but the removal of income taxes will spare IRD resources focussed on income tax collection issues. Given the higher level of income tax evasion and avoidance, the overall administration cost of a comprehensive expenditure tax system is likely to be lower than the current system. Compliance costs Compliance costs relate to having GST systems in place, registering and putting in returns. These compliance costs are largely in place, and will be little affected by an increase in the rate. The replacement of income taxes with a comprehensive expenditure tax would greatly reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals. The removal of income taxes removes complexities associated with calculating capital gains, issues with inventories, depreciation. There is no need to adjust for inflation. No need to deal with issues relating to property and speculation. Economic efficiency issues Final expenditure taxes comply with many of the findings of optimal tax theory: They effectively tax commodities at the final point of consumption and so do not tax the factors of production. They imply a zero capital income tax. They are eventually equivalent to taxes on wage income but, by taxing expenditure and not income, the tax will not influence the allocation of labour between different activities. A consumption tax will place a wedge between consuming and leisure (which is untaxed) and thus will reduce the supply of labour compared with a lump sum tax, but not necessarily worse than the existing bias against working imposed by income taxes. The lack of tax on capital income in conjunction with the longer time scale on the spending tax base (cf income) means that there is larger early life saving, which allows greater capital accumulation and growth (Summers 1981). Optimal tax theory suggests that the optimal commodity tax has variable rates based on the elasticity of demand for different products. The unobservable nature of non-constant individual preferences means that it is not practical to implement a tax like this. However an implication is that a uniform tax will potentially distort consumption patterns away from commodities where preferences are highly price sensitive, due to the income effect. Horizontal equity issues There are a couple of issues relating to the current design of New Zealand's GST. The tax's implementation needs to be shifted from a destination basis to an origin basis to ensure that exports of services are treated the same as exports of products and to ensure that international electronic commerce does not erode the tax base. There is also an issue with taxing financial services, which was discussed in Special provisions on page 9). Vertical equity issues There is a perception that GST is a regressive tax that will harm the political acceptance of a comprehensive expenditure tax. Although a comprehensive expenditure tax does not actively redistribute income from rich to poor households (except via higher spending and therefore high tax payments by rich households) the regressive reputation of spending taxes Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 12 is more perception than reality. In practice an expenditure tax is not more regressive than a flat income tax system. However, societies tend to prefer more income redistribution than can be provided by a flat income tax rate alone. The options available to provide more income redistribution with a comprehensive expenditure tax is to somehow collect more tax from the spending of the rich or provide additional income support via the benefit system. The former approach would greatly complicate the tax system and potentially lead to economically costly distortions to spending patterns. Thus the practical approach is to have a flat tax rate coupled with a benefit system that directly delivers the amount of income redistribution that society prefers. Intergenerational/transition issues Retired elderly will want to draw down on assets which have been built up using after tax income. If the tax system moves from an income base to an expenditure base the elderly risk being effectively taxed twice: when they earned their income originally and then when they consume during their retirement years. This is a transition issue that would require "grandfathering". This could be done via some form of age based compensation or differentiation in the effective GST rate. Issue of taxing bequests There are moral/value arguments that bequests should be taxed to mitigate inter- generational inequalities. Parental wealth and the anticipation of bequests give recipients a head start in life, which is not necessarily correlated with ability. Kotlikoff (1988) notes that “there is strong evidence that intergenerational transfers play a very important and perhaps dominant role in US wealth accumulation” (p41). Kotlikoff however notes that the precise explanation for intergenerational transfers remains unclear. Intergenerational altruism might appear to be a likely candidate, but at least some stylised facts are at odds with the altruism model. For example, parents tend to allocate bequests equally among children, which is at odds with the altruism model which would predict differences in bequests as parents compensate for differences in children’s earning prospects. Also there is no evidence of differences in asset decumulation between elderly with or without children. Instead it seems that life cycle motives, but with uncertainty about life expectancy, drive saving behaviour and asset accumulation. If this is the case what does a tax on bequests or assets achieve? If family altruism is the motivation for bequests, then an unavoidable tax on bequests will encourage a greater accumulation of assets and therefore welfare loss for parents. If lifecycle considerations dominate, the bequest tax will have minimal impact on parental behaviour, but it will reduce the windfall gain for children. Presuming that life cycle motives dominate, the absence of bequest taxes means that the next generation will be taxed more heavily if income from capital is taxed, but their bequest will escape taxation unless consumption is taxed. A comprehensive expenditure tax will ultimately tax all bequests that are not reinvested. What about a tax on the stock of capital? A key motivation is that it will encourage greater productive use of assets. But if bequest motives dominate people will be encouraged to shift resources offshore to escape the tax. On the other hand if life cycle factors dominate, the incentive will perhaps be more in line with the motivation for taxing the stock of capital, Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 13 however the resulting decrease in the after-tax return on capital is still likely to encourage an outflow of capital offshore. The net impact is likely to be a depreciation in the currency, resulting in a decline in the purchasing power of New Zealand domiciled households. Those households that own overseas assets are likely to be hedged, but those without assets will simply experience a fall in purchasing power. The potential offset will be a relative increase in wages. The decline in the exchange rate will also provide a competitive offset to the capital outflow. The net distributional impacts will be for the capital tax to encourage a shift towards more labour intensive production areas and (perhaps paradoxically) for the exchange rate depreciation to encourage a shift of production from non-tradeable towards tradeable sectors. This reallocation of activity may enhance the productive capacity of the economy, but it is not guaranteed. A first best option still seems to be to remove the tax wedge on investment decisions. Impact of inflation The tax base will be automatically adjusted for inflation. This will have powerful efficiency benefits compared with progressive income tax systems. Inflation can still impose equity issues via the benefit system. Interaction with benefit system The key interaction with the benefit system is the interaction between the required tax rate and the degree of targeting in the benefit system. A universal income entitlement introduces a direct trade-off between the generosity of the entitlement and the required tax rate. A targeted benefit system reduces the government's revenue requirement and so also the required GST rate, but introduces issues about appropriate proxies for targeting groups for support, adverse selection problems, and equity issues relating to people close to entitlement boundaries. International issues International issues disappear if GST is moved onto an origins basis (discussed in full in Argument for designing GST based on the origin principle on page 19). The removal of income taxes, particularly on capital income will attract inflows of capital. Ultimately the key influence will be a fall in the New Zealand risk premium reflecting higher savings and greater economic growth as the economy performance improves. Implementation issues Taxation is a system of coercively collecting revenues from individuals who will tend to resist. The coercive nature of taxes implies that the resource cost of implementing a tax system is large (Slemrod 1990). The budget for the Inland Revenue Department in New Zealand in 2009 was $660m, or about 1% of revenue collected by the Department. In addition there is the compliance cost of taxes imposed on individuals and companies. Other costs include equity issues associated resulting from the evasion of tax payments, which ultimately forces a higher tax burden on those who are less willing or able to evade. Even in the absence of evasion, any tax system will inevitably cause distortions as individuals substitute away from relatively highly taxed goods or activities to relatively lightly taxed items. This is known as tax arbitrage. It extends to taxing different bases, ie if one taxes Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 14 spending/wages/capital it will encourage people to re-arrange their activities to minimise their tax exposure. At the extreme this will be via illegal evasion, but a poorly designed tax system will offer legitimate means for reducing their tax liability. Such arbitrage results in an erosion of the tax base. For example if one wishes to tax a $100m activity with a 30% tax rate, one’s expected tax revenue will be $30m. If, however, if the imposition of the tax results in evasion, avoidance or a reduction in the activity one might see, say, a 10% reduction in the activity from $100m to $90m, which would result in an equivalent 10% reduction in the amount of tax collected (from $30m to $27m). Implying that while the statutory tax rate might be 30%, the effective tax rate is just 27%. OECD (2006) notes that governments might increase overall tax compliance by simplifying their tax system. This is because the main complexities in tax systems arise from the definition of the tax base (eg whether the income in question is taxable or not, along with the use of special tax rates, tax allowances, and tax credits) and not so much from the tax rate structure (ie what tax rates apply in different situations). The costs of a tax relate to its administration, its compliance burden, and its excess burden or deadweight cost. Deadweight costs result when people turn to less preferred substitutes or employ less satisfactory methods of production as a result of the imposition of taxes. The size of this deadweight cost will be influenced by the incompleteness of the tax base, differentiation in effective tax rates for different activities, the availability of exemptions and allowances, and the responsiveness of people to prices on different goods and services (including in the production process) (Diewert and Lawrence, 2000). Although tax evasion represents a deliberate illegal action, which can have serious consequences for those caught, tax evasion appears to be a significant and pervasive problem. For example, Slemrod (2007) reports that the National Research Program estimated a $345 bn gross tax gap or 16.3% of estimated actual tax liability (paid plus unpaid) in the US. The equity implications of tax evasion are highlighted by the uneven distribution of where tax evasion occurs. Only 1% of wages and salaries were measured as being under-reported in the US study. Likewise just 4% of taxable interest and dividends were under-reported. Instead the main culprit was non-farm proprietor income where 57% of income was estimated not to have been reported! The lesson being that a complex tax system favours self-employed at the expense of employed wage and salary earners. Another finding reported by Slemrod (2007) is that higher income people evade less than those on low incomes, a result consistent with the adage that the poor evade, and the rich avoid. There has been a perception that value add tax (VAT) systems, like our goods and service tax (GST) are less susceptible to fraud and evasion due to a number of self enforcing aspects of their design. For example the ability for registered producers to claim back tax paid on inputs provides an incentive for businesses to register and comply with tax requirements. Indeed initial estimates of evasion of VAT were very low. For example, Slemrod (1990) reported that the revenue loss from evasion from the UK VAT in the 1980s were estimated to be around 1.5% of potential revenue. More recent estimates suggest that the gap between VAT receipts and the estimated true tax liability could be a magnitude higher at around 15% of the tax liability (Keen and Smith 2007). The types of fraud associated with VAT systems are described in the box: Typology of VAT fraud and design issues, below. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 15 As Keen and Smith note: “There is no doubt that the VAT is susceptible to evasion and fraud, running all the way from the occasional concealed sale to sophisticated and large scale attacks by organized crime. “But this is not cause for panic. All taxes face problems of noncompliance. One dollar paid in a fraudulent VAT refund is no more costly than one dollar of under-declared income tax. The question is not whether VAT is vulnerable to fraud and evasion – it obviously is – but whether it is more or less vulnerable than other taxes.” (p28) Where the tax applies may have greater influence than the exposure to fraud and evasion on the resulting economic consequences. For example, although evasion on VAT might have the same revenue consequences as avoidance of capital taxes, the consequences in terms of economic efficiency and resulting national welfare may be quite different. On the positive side Keen and Smith consider that most VAT fraud issues can be resolved by good design. A VAT system with the following characteristics is likely to have a relatively low exposure to fraud: • one single rate, • reasonable high thresholds for registration (but ideally linked to a low-burden modest lump-sum tax for small operations), • limited zero-ratings and exemptions, and • effectively insulates international trade transactions from the tax (where we would argues for the shift in the implementation of GST from a destination to an origins basis). As Slemrod (1990) notes no tax system can stand alone without an enforcement mechanism supporting it. The question ultimately becomes which system can be more effectively policed. Also it is worth noting that the valid comparison is not the potential for evasion and avoidance of different tax systems but the overall integrity of the systems. A new system will be superior to the status quo so long as the combined administration, compliance and deadweight costs of the new system are less than the combined costs of the existing system. In this respect it is worth noting that the other benefits involved with a replacement of income taxes with an expenditure tax system include: • lower compliance costs (no income tax forms, no calculation of depreciation, no need to calculate capital gains, imputed rents, fringe benefits), • no need to police income tax issues, • the removal of the wedge distorting investment decisions, and • the tax system will capture a larger chunk of the proceeds from illegal activities when criminals make purchases. Typology of VAT fraud and design issues From Keen and Smith (2007) Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 16 Under reported sales: when a trader reports only a proportion of sales. The highest risk is with personal services where the final stage is large relative to inputs, eg hair dressing. In this case the competitive advantage of offering the service without tax is more likely to outweigh foregone refunds. The incentives for this type of fraud are compounded if the evasion also incorporates not declaring income for income tax purposes. Failure to register: The incentives for this type of fraud are probably highest with small scale operations with turnovers that only just require registration. Concern about the costs of complying with the tax may be a key motivation for evasion. Once again firms selling to final consumers (or to unregistered businesses) and with low relative inputs are likely to predominate. This is also likely to be more predominant if firms also wish to evade income tax. Misclassification of commodities: occurs when there are variable tax rates for different commodities (ie people reclassify commodities to be the lower taxed commodity). This type of fraud is not likely to be an issue if the VAT rate remains uniform, as with New Zealand’s GST. Omission of self-deliveries: when goods produced by the business and consumed by the proprietor, in principle taxable but not declared. This is particularly an issue with agriculture in less developed economies. Tax collected but not remitted: registered businesses charging customers VAT but disappearing before paying tax to authorities. Imported goods not brought into tax: This type of underpayment potentially increases with internet commerce. It is also dependent on the VAT being designed using the destination principle. This type of fraud would disappear in a VAT designed under an origins basis. False claims for credit or refund: false claims for exaggerated or non-existent purchases. This appears to be the most prevalent fraud in a VAT system. The risk of fraud from this source is likely to decline with the age of business as it implies implausibly low margins. The zero rating of exports makes the risk of diversion fraud high, ie claim that it has been exported to obtain zero rating, but sell domestically. Once again the risk of this form of fraud reduces/disappears with an origins based system. Credit claimed for VAT on purchases that are not creditable: A prime form of this type of fraud is when items are bought for private consumption but misrepresented as business inputs, allowing VAT to be recovered. The presence of income taxes increases the incentive for this type of fraud as the false business expense also helps to reduce the businesses’ income tax liability. This type of fraud is already prevalent in relation to under-reporting of self-employed incomes Bogus traders: companies may be set up solely to generate invoices that allow recovery of VAT What matters is not the number of possibilities for evasion but their quantitative significance. This is likely to be affected by the number of taxpayers in a position to exploit particular possibilities for abuse, the risks of detection, the effectiveness of enforcement activities, and the way in which the tax is designed. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 17 Key design issues: Rate differentiation: scope for fraud increase with different rates, zero-ratings, and to a lesser extent exemptions (the benefit of exemptions is that one does not have to deal with refunds, but the efficiency issues of differentiated rates persist). Level of VAT: The higher the rate the higher the potential return from successful fraud. High VAT rates are likely to encourage informality (non-registration): although high rates raise the unrecovered tax that informal operators will bear on their inputs the high rates also increase the output price they can charge while still undercutting formal operators. Registration thresholds: the revenue lost be setting a high threshold may be small compared with the saving of administration costs to authorities and compliance costs to the taxpayer. Simplified and lump-sum schemes for small traders: such schemes may offer both firms and the authorities substantial savings, while reducing evasions opportunities and competitive distortions. Timing of payments and refunds: quick payment of refunds by authorities increase the opportunity for false refund claim frauds. Summary A comprehensive expenditure tax system based entirely on a VAT/GST type tax system, with the abolition of income taxes, has many desirable attributes. It addresses ability to pay via its link to voluntary spending decisions. It is administratively simple to run, and as it can be based on existing GST systems already has all of the requisite infrastructure in place. It has minimal impacts on economic decision making, as it does not tax either capital or direct labour income, which suggests it will encourage a resource allocation close to optimal. The lack of tax on income removes the key administration and compliance costs associated with most tax systems. The lack of a tax on capital will encourage higher levels of early life saving and thus encourage capital accumulation and growth. This higher saving is reinforced by the expenditure tax base, which allows a lower effective tax rate. Under an expenditure tax one is taxed throughout one's spending life as distinct from income tax systems that are constrained by the shorter working life. GST type taxes are perceived by many to be regressive taxes. In fact expenditure taxes are equivalent to proportional income tax schedules. This means that like a flat tax system the tax is proportional in the sense that those who spend more pay more tax. They do not, however, impose a higher tax rate on higher spenders. Vertical equity issues can still be addressed in an expenditure tax system through the benefit system. Targeted or universal income entitlement systems would both result in a transfer of income from rich to poorer households. A remaining issue is that reliance on GST as the prime source of government revenue will require very high tax rates. Back of the envelope calculations suggest that a GST rate of 45% Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 18 might be required to replace the existing income and company tax rates. A higher GST rate will increase incentives to evade paying GST than is currently the case. But in net the amount of tax evasion should be lower under a comprehensive expenditure tax compared with income tax systems. To begin with the need to register in order to claim back tax on expenses provides a self enforcing element to value added tax systems. Secondly expenditure taxes are more effective in taxing the proceeds from illegal activities. International evidence suggests that evasion to GST-type taxes is considerably lower than facing income taxes (1.5% of potential GST revenue compared with 7% of potential income tax revenue). The removal of an income tax system would free considerable resources to police the GST system, without the need to increase the size of IRD. Finally a move to a concentration on GST would require the closure of an existing loophole in the GST system that discourages the net export of services. This could be addressed by shifting GST from a destination to an origin basis. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 19 2. ARGUMENT FOR DESIGNING GST BASED ON THE ORIGIN PRINCIPLE History New Zealand introduced a goods and service tax (GST) on 1 October 1986. This tax can be characterised as a consumption type value added tax. It taxes virtually all transactions within New Zealand at one uniform rate (initially 10%, 12.5% from 1 July 1989 to 30 September 2010, and 15% since 1 October 2010) . The design of the New Zealand GST adheres to the “destination principle”. The destination principle is used as a means of arbitrating on any jurisdictional issues with regards to taxing decisions. Effectively the destination principle implies that if a good or service is purchased (or rendered) in New Zealand it should be liable for GST. In principle this means that imports should be subject to GST, as the goods and services will be purchased (or rendered) in New Zealand. Exports on the other hand are zero rated (ie exempt) as final consumption will be offshore. Application of the destination principle in the design of value added taxes is a logical progression from the Diamond-Mirrlees conclusion that aggregate production should be efficient. This means that just as no taxes should be raised between firms, no taxes should be imposed on transactions between countries, and international trade would then take place at producer prices (Kay 1990). An alternative to using the destination principle to determine the jurisdictional boundaries of a commodity tax system is to use the origin principle, ie where the origin of production (rather than destination for consumption) guides the tax design. Although it is typically the case that income taxes are levied on the origin principle and consumption taxes on a destination basis, there is nothing inherent in the structure of these taxes that requires this result (Kay 1990). One can see why the New Zealand Government chose to design its GST around the destination principle given the institutional arrangements prevalent in the 1980s. The destination principle was (and still remains) the international norm in value added tax design. When officials instigated the process of designing a GST in 1984, New Zealand still operated under a fixed exchange rate regime and there was a high degree of wage rigidity given the preponderance of compulsory unionism in many sectors of the economy. The combination of these factors (fixed exchange rates, wage rigidities and the dominant use of the destination principle internationally) would have encouraged policy makers to favour a GST designed using destination principles ahead of one based on origin principles. The reason for this is that the combination of the three factors mentioned would have meant that an origins based GST would have imposed competitive disadvantages onto the New Zealand export sector. In an environment when the real exchange could not readily adjust (ie fixed exchange rate and wage rigidities) applying a tax onto exports would increase the world price of products produced in New Zealand. The tax system would unfairly Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 20 disadvantage New Zealand based exporters until wages eventually adjusted to the changed environment. However, the presence of wage rigidities would mean that the disruptive impact would have a devastating impact on the export industry during the slow adjustment. However, it has been demonstrated by Lockwood, de Meza and Myles (1995) that these pre- conditions disfavouring the origins based approach is a special rather than a general case – easing just one of these rigidities results in virtual equivalence between the destination and the origins approach. Indeed the special case no longer applies in New Zealand: a flexible exchange rate system was introduced in March 1985 (actually in the middle of the time when the GST system was being designed) and wage rigidities have been eased considerably since the introduction of the 1991 Employment Contracts Act. The destination principle implies that rather than taxing either value added created in New Zealand, or the genuine consumption of New Zealand residents, GST has effectively become a tax on consumption that takes place within New Zealand. As will be discussed below this geographical determination of GST incidence imposes a distortion to economic behaviour that is likely to be detrimental to economic performance and the living standards of New Zealanders. Implications of the imperfect application of destination principle For the most part the GST operating in New Zealand is well designed: • It is broad based • It is based on real transactions and so easy to enforce and apply • It does not interfere with production efficiency by taxing intermediate consumption • It is broadly speaking self-policed • There is just one uniform tax rate, which simplifies collection and enforcement The key problem with GST is its reliance on the destination principle and the difficulty in applying the destination principle to services. In principle all imports should be liable to the tax and all exports should be exempt. This is illustrated in the following circular flow diagram of income flows in the economy, which is drawn to illustrate the impact of how GST should impact on the economy in principle. The arrows represent flows of income between households (the spenders) and businesses (the producers) and back again. As households spend money on goods and services, the government raises revenue by filtering income of households through expenditure taxes such as GST, excise duties and tariffs. With this income, plus income earned though income taxes, the government redistributes income to households and businesses (providing public services along the way). Some of the household’s spending is on imports, which are a leakage from the system (income is spent abroad). Note this leakage occurs after the expenditure tax filter, as imports are taxable under GST, excise duty and tariffs. While imports represent a leakage Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 21 from the system, exports represent an income injection, which under the destination principle are not liable for GST. Income earned by businesses are eventually paid out to households, after the government takes its cut through income taxes (potential foreign leakages, eg profits abroad, are ignored as the focus here is on expenditure taxes). Figure 1 If GST was implemented comprehensively in this way there would be no significant problems with the design of GST. However, GST does not operate in this pure way in practice. This is because of the difficulty in applying the destination principle to services, and in particular tourism . The national accounts rightly treat the expenditure by New Zealanders abroad as an import and the expenditure of foreigners visiting New Zealand as an export. However, the way that the destination principle is applied by the New Zealand GST means that the expenditure of New Zealanders abroad escapes having to pay GST (though they may have to pay expenditure taxes in the countries that they visit). It also means that tourists who visit New Zealand are liable to pay GST and other expenditure taxes during their stay in New Zealand. The impacts of this are illustrated in our amended circular flow diagram below (Figure 2). Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 22 Figure 2 The reason why New Zealand governments have been comfortable with this approach could be because the fiscal implications are generally positive. New Zealand usually runs a net surplus on travel. In the year to December 1998, for example, travel credits in the balance of payments (ie spending by overseas visitors) were $3.2 billion (implying a GST contribution of $358 million, assuming that the $3.2 billion includes GST). Over the same period New Zealanders are estimated to have spent $2.6 billion on travel abroad, which would have raised the marginally lower amount of $330 million. From a government finance perspective the difference is actually quite trivial. But the costs to the government (and indeed to New Zealand citizens) of correcting this problem in applying the destination principle to GST would not be trivial. For example, it would be more correct to allow overseas tourists the right to claim back GST on expenses during their visit to New Zealand and to attempt to raise GST of New Zealanders spending while abroad. But in practice this alternative is likely to be a dog’s breakfast; it would add exceedingly to the costs of administering the tax and could potentially undermine the integrity of what is generally a well functioning expenditure tax. Allowing tourists the ability to reclaim GST from their spending in New Zealand would be open to abuse (eg tourists purchasing products or services on behalf of New Zealanders). It is also unlikely that countries will ever be very successful in taxing activities that take place wholly within other jurisdictions (Kay 1990). Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 23 It would seem at first sight that the cure is worse than the disease. But the issue is wider than just one of fiscal integrity. The aim of the destination principle is to ensure that taxes are not imposed on the transaction between countries and so ensure that international trade takes place at producer prices. The application of GST in New Zealand does not ensure this. Indeed it places a significant wedge between the earning power of different activities (eg between farming or running a home-stay) and the costs to consumers of different activities (eg holidaying on the Gold Coast or at Taupo). In this way it encourages a misallocation of resources that must be detrimental to the economy’s performance. The GST raises the relative returns of exporting goods above that of exporting services. It also encourages consumers to spend their money on trips abroad ahead of travel within New Zealand or indeed on any other product available within New Zealand. Although the misapplication of GST looks like a tax on overseas tourists it is in reality a tax on the incomes of those in the tourist industry and other traded services industries. For example, if a tourist arrives in New Zealand with a budget of $NZ1000, the tourist industry is likely at most to receive $888.89 of this while the remainder is collected as GST by the Government (ignoring other duties such as excise and tariffs). If the same person spent their money on sheepskin products (either overseas or at a duty free store) the export sector (including associated services) would receive the entire $NZ1000. By lowering the relative returns from tourism, GST will reduce incentives to invest in the industry and so hamper the industry’s ability to grow. Instead the application of the tax encourages resources into other (primarily export good) sectors that have a lower potential for growth – except through the advantage provided by the unfair application of GST. The solution There is in fact a surprisingly simple solution to the GST problem faced by tourism and other service exporters. The answer is simply to convert the application of GST from being destination based to origin based. That is rather than attempt the exceedingly complex task of removing the unfair tax on the tourism industry, simply remove the dispensation currently provided to other exporters. Similarly instead of attempting the impossible task of taxing New Zealanders who travel abroad, simply remove all taxes on imports. The impact of moving GST onto an origins basis is illustrated in Figure 3 below. By taxing all exports and exempting all imports, all trade is moved to the same side of the expenditure tax filter, thus removing distortions between different types of economic activity and preserving the aim of not taxing transaction between countries. Although it might not seem immediately obvious, as long as a country does not attempt to tax both exports and imports, but only one or the other, then the country is not actually taxing the transactions of another country. A pure origins based system taxes value added (ie production within New Zealand) while a pure destination based system would effectively tax consumption (ie the spending of New Zealanders). In both cases only New Zealand transactions are being taxed. Indeed the chief culprit in this regard remain tariffs which distort spending and production decisions until their final removal. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 24 Figure 3 An obvious objection that many might have to this approach is to question what the impact of applying GST to our exports will do to the competitiveness of the export sector. The short answer is probably nothing. In the presence of a flexible exchange rate, one would expect the introduction of an origins based GST system to trigger a one-off compensating reduction in the nominal exchange rate. Indeed Lockwood, de Meza and Myles (1995) demonstrate that a unilateral switch to an origins based system will have neutral inter-country impacts under virtually all circumstances. Unlike the complexities involved in attempting to clean up the destination approach, a move to an origin approach is actually likely to reduce the administration burden faced by IRD and the government. The taxing of exports would end IRD or Customs’ role in administering and policing the zero rating of exports. Customs would also not be required to apply GST to imports. Although adopting the origin principle for determining on which transactions GST should apply seems to be the most straightforward and efficient way of determining GST incidence, getting the government to change this policy could prove to be a challenge. Proposing a tax system that taxes exports and exempts imports will represent a disconcerting leap of logic to many. It will just not feel right and the neutrality of the scheme will not be obvious for many. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 25 Winners and losers The distortions created by the current application of GST means that it favours: • exporters of physical goods (eg primary producers and manufacturers), • firms that service these exporters, and • people who have a propensity to travel abroad. Moving the application of GST from a destination to an origin principle will yield a more neutral tax system, but it does mean that these groups who are currently benefiting from the current system will be relatively worse off. It is not so much that these groups will face an absolute cost, but rather that they will not benefit from the exchange rate depreciation to the same degree as service exporters. In other words a shift in the GST regime will raise the profits of service exporters, but it should not affect the profits of goods exporters. Stronger relative returns for service exporters will increase the willingness of people to invest in the service export sector, and so encourage faster sector growth than the current discriminating tax system is allowing. As the origin based system is economically more neutral, plus the benefits of it having lower administration and enforcement costs, it is highly probable that the redistribution of resources emanating from the regime change will yield a faster expansion in national real incomes than would occur under the current system. The increase in service sector profits has to come from somewhere. Their source is the impact of the exchange rate depreciation on encouraging overseas residents to spend more on New Zealand services like tourism and on discouraging the import of overseas services. The fall in the dollar will encourage more visitors to visit New Zealand and to spend more while here. It will also make it relatively more expensive for New Zealanders to travel abroad. This will have further positive impacts on the New Zealand travel industry, to the extent that this encourages New Zealanders to holiday in New Zealand rather than abroad. Making overseas travel more expensive implies a short-term fall in New Zealand living standards. However this short-term fall should be eventually compensated for by the extent that the more neutral tax system improves long-term income prospects. Tax Working Group Submission David Grimmond 26 3. TAX TREATMENT OF HOME OWNERSHIP The special tax status of home ownership is causing a growing divide in New Zealand society that poses one of the most serious risks to future social harmony. The tax free status of home ownership is a financial incentive that accelerates the demand for home ownership. According to the Reserve Bank non-financial wealth (primarily housing and land) accounts for about 55% of household net wealth. The national accounts indicate that the service from owner-occupied houses (ie the imputed rent from home ownership) contributes 7% to GDP each year. While the income from other investments are taxed, the return from home ownership is tax free as home owners are effectively receiving the benefit of rent-free living tax-free. The implication is that the return on housing will typically outperform the after-tax returns from non-housing investments. As a result there is considerable demand for home ownership and the rapid repayment of mortgages that leads to rapid inflation of house prices and a high concentration of wealth in illiquid housing assets. Much of the debate about housing tax issues has focused on capital gains taxes. As I have argued above, I consider the optimal solution would be for New Zealand to abolish all forms of income tax and replace it with a comprehensive expenditure tax system. This would circumvent the need for any form of capital gains taxes. If New Zealand chooses to persist with an income tax system then the second best approach would be to introduce a system of taxing the imputed rent from home ownership. The purpose of a tax on imputed rent is less about raising revenue and more about removing distortions to saving and investment behaviour. This can be achieved if the tax liability from imputed rents can be offset against mortgage interest payments. This will induce homeowners to be more circumspect about rapidly paying off their mortgages. The net result will be that households will be more likely to invest in non-housing assets, thus diversifying their savings portfolios and increasing funds available for non-housing investments. The introduction of the imputed rent tax will also reduce the (tax-induced) incentive for home ownership. The resulting fall in demand for home ownership will slow the pace of house price increases, lower potential capital gains and reduce the size of the wealth divide between home owners and renters.

This is well debated in other papers and, within academic literature, conclusively in favour of the introduction of capital gains tax. The sole focus is upon the form a comprehensive capital gains tax should take if implemented into New Zealand tax law. In particular, the following recommendations are made in respect of the implementation of a suitable comprehensive capital gains tax system for New Zealand: 1. a realised basis should be adopted; 2. capital gains tax should apply upon emigration and death; 3. the primary dwelling should be included on a concessionary basis in the capital gains tax base; 4. there should be an allowance for already taxed retained earnings when a gain on the disposal of shares is recognised; 5. and finally, and most importantly, the capital gains tax rate should be 28% without an allowance for indexation. The main contribution of this submission is to offer a suggestion for a coherent system of comprehensive capital gains tax and most significantly, to recommend an appropriate flat rate of tax that has a sound underlying basis and is easy to implement. 1. Choosing between an accruals’ basis and a realisation basis for New Zealand’s CGT regime Almost all OECD countries that operate a CGT regime currently do so on a realisation basis 1 . Alone, this is not a sufficient basis for New Zealand to choose such an approach, although it may provide indications of the better approach. Burman and White make a strong 1 Evans, C and Krever, R. “Taxing Capital Gains: A Comparative Analysis and Lessons for New Zealand” 23 NZJTLP 486; Huang, C. and Elliffe, C. “Is New Zealand Smarter than Other Countries or Simply Special? Reconsidering the Realisation-based Capital Gains Tax in the Light of South Africa’s Experience”, (2010) 16 NZJTLP 269. 2 case for an accruals-based CGT. Their observation of the conceptual superiority of the accruals’-basis is built around a number of advantages identified of that system. The approach eliminates the need to limit deductions against other income and the taxation system is simplified, when compared to a realisation basis, as fully deductible losses eliminate bias in the tax system against risk-taking. The lock-in effect also does not arise as this relates to the realisation basis only. Such an approach would fully integrate the capital and income taxation regime, with imputation credits no longer contingent on the distribution of profits. Additional benefits include substantially increased taxation progressivity and a structural increase in tax revenues. In addition, the accruals’ basis tax on capital gains eliminates the distortion of inflation when taxation on income is delayed until realisation. Arguably, an accruals’-based CGT would increase revenue volatility as government is effectively sharing part of the investment risk with the investor. Nonetheless, any CGT is going to increase revenue volatility, unless predicated on a risk free return model, discussed below. There are a number of practical difficulties with taxing capital gains on an accruals’ basis. Some assets are difficult to value prior to realisation and, even where they are readily and costlessly available, distortions arise as the taxpayer may be required to sell down their holdings partially in readily divisible assets. Alternatively, where the asset is readily divisible, but its division may materially, qualitatively change the asset, reducing its value, such as by a loss of control or significant influence induced by the reduced holding, a realisation-based CGT would better support fairness to the taxpayer. The realisation basis would also enhance efficiency (over an accruals basis) as there is less distortion to the taxpayer’s preferences introduced by the taxation system. Where the asset is not divisible the taxpayer is forced to borrow or access other cash flows, increasing their risk exposure. Alternatively, they can sell the whole asset but this materially influences their economic decisions, introducing economic inefficiency. These are the central objections to the form 2 of CGT. They support the case for a realisation-based CGT, rather than the, in many regards, theoretically superior accruals–basis. 2 The primary objection is almost certainly to the existence of a CGT. This objection is not conceptually grounded but is based on a more general preference to avoid taxes. 3 Burman and White 3 make a case for the risk free return model of capital gain taxation. The McLeod Committee report 4 indicated some support for this model. They observe that this approach does not increase the volatility of government revenues, that the investor shares none of the investment risk with the government but that, politically, it may be difficult to persuade taxpayers that they are liable to tax at points where their assets have fallen substantially in value. 5 Under this regime, capital is taxed on an imputed risk free rate regardless of the actual change in value. The case for the risk free return model for an accrual-based CGT relies on the assumption that there are no pure profits. That is, markets efficiently price risks and that returns share a uniform positive correlation with risk, so that the return above the risk free rate is matched exactly with incremental risk. In effect, under such assumptions, taxing the risk premium to the risk free rate involves socialising risk. The McLeod Committee further expound that this could be substituted by governmental risk free borrowing, applied to buy a portfolio of risky assets. This would have the same net effect without a cost to the taxpayer. There is a need to consider several key issues with the risk free rate model. One important issue relates to the safety of certain conceptual underpinnings of the case for the risk free rate model. There is an extensive body of research supporting the view that markets are not as efficient as the earliest proponents of the efficient markets’ hypothesis supposed 6 . Equally, it also involves a higher net inflow of economic benefits to the investor than would arise from an investment at the risk free rate. The alternative to an exclusion of CGT liability up to a certain level is that the risky investor is permanently shielded from full taxation of their gains. 3 Burman, L, and White, D. “Taxing Capital Gains in New Zealand: Assessment and recommendations” (Paper presented to Victoria University Tax Working Group, Victoria University of Wellington, Session three, Rutherford House, September 2009) 4 McLeod Committee Report, formally known as the Tax Review 2001, “Final Report”; Elliffe, C. and Huang, CC. “Hard to argue with the benefits of capital gains tax” The New Zealand Herald (online ed, Auckland, 11 January 2011) 5 A further difficulty not discussed by Burman and White is that a RFRM would effectively increase relative returns to the risk premium. In this sense a CGT would, contrary to an important argument against the tax, stimulate risky investment. Under standard assumptions, investors’ risk appetites would systematically migrate to greater risk. 6 Cassidy, John “The inefficiency of the market isn’t an open question” The New Yorker (online ed, 15 Oct 2015); Shiller, RJ. “Irrational Exuberance”, NJ (2013, Princeton University Press). As it relates to this discussion, the higher long-term returns on riskier assets is the important factor determining the need to tax the risk component of risky returns. 4 An alternative accrual based option is broadly in line with those suggested by Vickrey 7 and Auerbach 8 , involving the allowance of the taxpayer to carryover CGT liability, with the liability amount attracting interest until the asset is realised. This proposal removes some of the key objections to a CGT. This avoids the earlier liquidity complications described as supporting a realisation basis to CGT. Some parts of this proposal require greater specification, such as the interest rate used but these are minor issues. Potential concerns of greater substance lie in the fact that a CGT regime based on accruals reifies market prices at any given point without the income coming in. To illustrate why this has substantial implications, rather than just trifling conceptual ones, let us suppose that an investor bought shares in a company for $10,000. The investor holds those shares for five years, before selling them for $10,000. Over the holding period, the shares rise in value by 25% a year before falling by the full amount of the first four years’ cumulative gains in the fifth year. Over the holding period, the investor has incurred a liability to CGT and interest of (we will assume the company tax rate of 28%) $4,260. The final year loss of value of $14,414 9 results in a tax deductible of $4,036, leaving the investor with a time-eroded $10,000 10 and a liability to CGT of $224. It is difficult to construct the case in which this outcome improves justice or efficiency. If we add the assumption of no income flowing from the investment over the holding period for simplicity, but without compromising the conceptual integrity of the scenario, the investor has had nil income and an effective capital loss but has a ‘wash up’ liability to $224. Concerns that economic agents may be encouraged to take risks at levels below those that would arise in the event of a tax system that does not introduce any distortions are realised in the scenario outlined above. The approach also violates equity considerations. There are, at the minimum, a range of plausible scenarios in which both of these qualities are significantly reduced under a CGT predicated on a carry-over accrual-based CGT. For these reasons, such an approach should be rejected. 11 7 Vickrey, W. “Averaging of income for income-tax purposes”, 47 Journal of Political Economy 379. 8 Auerbach, A. “Retrospective capital gains taxation” 81 American Economic Review 167. 9 $10,000, compounded over 4 years at 25% gives a total capital gain of $14,414 10 $8,959 at a 2% inflation rate 11 Notably, the scenario presented represents merely a class of potential cases. Not all outcomes will be as biased against the taxpayer (or even biased against the taxpayer). If, in year five, the investment observes the same return as was the case for the preceding four years, and the investor sells, the taxation implications would be consistent with equity and efficiency conceptual foundations. However, the scenario approximately mirrors a realistic situation in which an investor gained exposure to an investment at some point in a rising market and, following the collapse of that market, was forced (or chose) to liquidate their investment. 5 Burman and White 12 describe the realisation basis as the ‘second best option’. This research does not support this view, making the case for a realisation-based CGT. This case is essentially deductive, ruling out accruals-based CGT options based on their potential to violate the core principals of a sound tax system. The realisation-based CGT limits loss allowance to current capital gains, with the carry-over of loss deductions where there are insufficient current gains available, such as might arise with a generalised market downturn. The popularity of the realisation basis, along with the problem of hard-to-value assets 13 , added to the liquidity problem, and potentially, a range of scenarios in which any accrual-based system would significantly impair fairness or efficiency, draws towards the conclusion that any acceptable, workable CGT is realisation based. From this conclusion, the discussion turns to address the mechanics of a realisation-based system of CGT. The approach adopted in this research develops the preferred system by considering the principal objections to CGT simpliciter and developing specification of a realisation-based CGT to minimise the substance of those objections. 2. Capital gains tax should apply upon emigration and death In contrast to the US system, it is conceptually sounder to tax capital gains at death to prevent an indefinite deferral of tax. The case has been made that gains could be carried over at death to prevent the forced liquidation of family businesses to meet CGT liabilities. This argument presupposes that the dissolution of family businesses is otherwise necessary and that it is necessarily undesirable that this occurs. This position is not persuasive 14 . The presumption must be that the intergenerational transfer of wealth is innately desirable. Such a presumption appears to stretch any reasonable understanding of the concept of equity. 12 Burman and White, n 3 at 18. 13 Evans and Krever n 1; Krever, R. “Structural Issues in the Taxation of Capital Gains”. 1(2) Australian Tax Forum 168 14 Since no later than Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations inheritance tax has been argued for on economic grounds (Steltzer, I, 2007, Listen to Adam Smith: inheritance tax is good, The Spectator, https://www.spectator.co.uk/2007/10/listen-to-adam-smith-inheritance-tax-is-good/) . A related point is that more than 80% of family businesses fail in the hands of the third generation, the first creates and builds, the second typically sustains, and the third squanders, hence the expression ‘shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations’ (Next Generation Survey 2016, Great Expectations: the next generation of family business leaders, <www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/family-business/next-gen-survey.html>. There is no sound economic basis to the preservation of privilege. At its core this argument is an appeal to some mawkish emotional impulse tied, presumably to heritage. Concerns about inheritance as a driver of wealth inequality have been raised by Thomas Piketty in Capital in the Twenty-First Century (Harvard College, New York, 2013). In his bestseller, Piketty argues that inherited wealth is likely to play a greater role in peoples’ fortunes than work or skill, as wealth concentrates and higher returns to capital are achieved. 6 Equally, the argument ‘from family business dissolution’ presupposes that the beneficiary of an estate is unable to meet a portion of the cost of the family business (the CGT liability arising on transfer) to acquire the business. An external acquiree would pay the full market value in an arms-length transaction between willing and knowledgeable parties. It is not clear that equity or efficiency are advanced by sponsoring a particular understanding of heritage, or that it is the role of a competent system of taxation. A further complication with this approach is that it aggravates the ‘lock in effect’ (discussed later). On these grounds roll over after death should not be part of a realisation-based CGT. Clearly, the same principle must apply upon emigration. As most tangible assets are difficult to emigrate, the likelihood of a capital gains tax arising upon emigration on New Zealand based tangible assets is low – assuming New Zealand will tax on a source basis. However, it is possible that emigration of an individual could mean tangible assets located outside New Zealand and intangible assets could leave the New Zealand tax jurisdiction. Without a capital gains tax on assets upon emigration, opportunities to avoid the tax will arise. Also, the opportunity to impose the capital gains tax due will reduce. 3. The primary dwelling should be included in the capital gains tax base, with an allowance for ‘excess’ holding costs and capital improvements. While we understand taxation of the primary residence has been removed from the Tax Working Group’s scope, omitting its discussion from this paper would detract from the cohesive solution suggested here. Practical considerations include widespread resistance to the taxation of homes. Overseas approaches balance this issue by applying a generous tax-free threshold. This approach is implicitly progressive as the incidence of tax falls more heavily on more expensive housing but the solution is imperfect. To illustrate this suppose the threshold is set at the average Auckland house price ($1,000,000) 15 . A threshold set at that level would have practical implications for Eketahuna properties around about the time the sun burns out and all life on earth ceases to exist. Potential solutions would be necessarily complicated, 15 Barfoot and Thompson “January 2018 housing market update” (Barfoot and Thompson, 2018) <www.barfoot.co.nz/market-reports/2018/january/market-update> states the average price of January house sales was $934,753, an increase of 1.5% over the preceding three months. 7 involving the determination of regional property prices, those regions mean property prices, standard deviations from the means, and determination of regional boundaries. Without becoming excessively complicated the determination of regions would be necessarily crude and involve capricious ‘cut points’. Despite these issues, some method of shielding capital gains on principal residences is politically necessary and is also required to prevent excessive discord with the principles of equity and efficiency 16 . However, a blanket exemption of the primary residence is not accepted as forming part of the best approach. Suppose a principal residence owner moved between two similarly priced Auckland properties due to changed family circumstances. In each case, the houses are priced at the mean Auckland house price of $1,000,000. The taxpayer is liable to tax on the property sold and has to take out a mortgage to finance that tax liability to buy the second house. Except for the type of utility required by the homeowner, the market evaluates the properties as equivalent. This condition appears to strike at fairness and may disrupt efficiency, as the home owner may avoid the change in properties or rent out the first property and lease the second. This would interfere with the taxpayer’s preferences as they require one house, and the ownership of that house, rather than to become a landlord and a renter at the same time. With these concerns in mind, rather than an arbitrary threshold, a preferable option is tax exemption in relation to gains applied to the purchase of another property (following an approach applied in certain overseas jurisdictions), so that the investor’s gains are untaxed in the scenario above. A threshold that draws very expensive housing into the CGT net, increasing the progressivity of the tax system, may also augment such a regime. Where an investor has held a property for twenty years and it has risen in value from $200,000 to $1,000,000, and the investor sells it, the CGT liability without a repurchase allowance would be 28% of $800,000 or $224,000. If we assume the taxpayer buys another house for $500,000, their CGT liability reduces to $140,000. Arguendo suppose taxpayer A invests in a business, preferring to rent accommodation, enabling the taxpayer to devote his capital to the business. Taxpayer B buys a house at the same time as taxpayer A chooses to rent and build his business. Over a period of ten years A’s business grows in value from $100,000 to $1,000,000. Taxpayer B’s house appreciates from the same initial value to $1,000,000 also. Taxpayer B sells her house and 16 A survey conducted by Sharma and Davey, n 9, found that a majority of tax experts favoured an exemption for the family home, because it is the family home. The argument in this research is more pragmatic, arguing that, to the extent an exemption is indicated, it relates to political necessity rather than observance of principles. 8 applies all of the proceeds from the sale to another house. Under the proposed CGT regime, B is not liable to CGT whereas taxpayer A is. Further suppose that retained earnings comprise half of taxpayer A’s gain on sale of his business 17 . Taxpayer A is liable to CGT on $400,000 at 28% or $112,000. This outcome is consistent with neither equity or efficiency concepts and, so, must be considered sub-optimal. In this sense, it is a concession to political realities rather than a conceptually-based element of the proposed system. It must be remembered that the aim is an improved taxation system, rather than an ideal system. Notwithstanding, the initial introduction of a $1,000,000 threshold represents a reasonable first step towards a comprehensive CGT 18 . Equally, as noted earlier, inefficiency is inevitable with or without a principal residence exemption. The counter-argument is that unavoidable deficiencies inherent in a CGT regime are smaller than those that arise without a (fairly) comprehensive CGT. Given the ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’ features of the repurchase exempted approach, a superior alternative may be found to that of the proposal above. Concessions in the taxation of primary residence capital gains are typical of existing CGT regimes. We propose that the form of necessary concessions should balance the integrity of the CGT base while yielding to political realities only as much as is necessary. A more conceptually coherent concession is an imputed rental (as income) calculus. This involves treating an imputed ‘rental’ as notional taxable income and imputed ‘expenses’ as deductible against the notional rental income. The notional expenses represent interest and other costs associated with the property. These amounts are capitalised with the cost of the asset to reduce the taxable capital gain (assuming notional expenses exceed notional rental income). Part of operationalisation supports a standardised, schedular approach provided by the IRD, with values assigned to net outgoings. Imputed rentals would be determined on a standardised basis, also provided by the IRD, and directly related to and calculated on empirically-determined averages, based on capitalisation. While these proposals appear 17 Exempting retained earnings from the CGT regime forms part of the specifications of this research and is discussed later. 18 Arguments for an alternative capping approach have also been made. Jacob Spoonley, “A Sanctuary from the Taxman? The Design of the Primary Residence Exemption” 21 NZJTLP 69, argues for a capped exemption of $300,000. This value is really about the magnitude of the required tax-exempt level to satisfy political acceptability, rather than about tax concepts or system optimisation. Such a cap (exemption from CGT for gains made up to the cap) would increase ‘churning’. It is also very generous, unlikely to result in significant government revenues from this source but it would avoid CGT on most middle-class houses, and so increase political acceptability. 9 complicated, a modest periodic impost only is involved for the IRD and there would be no incremental specific financial records required from the taxpayer. Implementation would require simple, clear explanations to assuage concerns that may arise among the general public. This proposal is illustrated in the example below: In relation to this allowance, assume, for example, that a homeowner has sold her house for $600,000, having bought it five years earlier for $400,000. We can calculate the average capitalisation by adding the purchase and sale price, divided by 2 19 . If an imputed rental of $5,200/$100,000 of capitalisation is determined by the IRD, and the value of imputed net outgoings (interest, paid or notional, maintenance, rates, insurance) is $7,500/$100,000 of capitalisation, $2,300/$100,000/year of holding is capitalised. The equation is then: $2,300 x 5\* x 5\*\* = $57,500 (In relation to the present example) \* $100,000’s of house capitalisation) \*\* years house held The net effect of these calculations is that the CGT liability relates to $142,500 ($39,900) as opposed to tax liability of $56,000 in relation to a gain of $200,000, without the exempt amount 20 . Potential objections based on excessive compliance or administrative costs wilfully exaggerate those incremental costs. The IRD could periodically make annual or even multi- year updates to the relevant schedules based on market developments. The taxpayer could retain the tax-deductible services of a tax agent (if required) to calculate the exempt capital gain. Given the modest task involved, such services could not reasonably be burdensomely expensive. The only substantive concern is that what are fairly straight-forward proposals may not be universally perceived as such by the general public. This concern indicates the 19 An average capitalisation could be used, taking the end-point values, divided by two, multiplied by years held. In the present case, this would provide an average capitalisation of $500,000. 20 In addition to this, material improvements should be capitalised at cost. This substantially addresses the ‘mansion effect’ whereby homeowners may be inclined to over-capitalise their homes to secure tax-free advantages. 10 need for clear explanations and examples to support implementation. In this regard, the concern is no greater than when GST was introduced to New Zealand in 1986. The taxpayer would not need to make annual returns, or calculate imputed income or expenses annually. The compliance cost would arise only at realisation and require the purchase price and sale price, to determine the multiplier of IRD schedule rates for imputed income and expenses over the holding period. The conceptual basis for this exemption is that incremental running costs incurred in home ownership, over the costs of rental, are effectively an asset’s holding cost. There is no conceptual reason that these should not be added to the capital asset cost (capitalised), along with costs associated with capital improvements. This allowance provides that part of the property gain in value that is purely a function of a movement in market prices as opposed to an ‘earned’, or paid for, component of the increase in that property value, is the part that attracts CGT. In this sense, the treatment is analogous to the exemption from CGT of gains attributable to cumulative retained earnings related to the gain realising investor’s shares in the listed company. Notably, this proposal is developed cognisant of the recommendation of Evans and Krever 21 , who argue that political necessity probably does require that the family home (principal residence in un-emotive speak) must be granted some kind of concession. They explore the Scandanavian option which is similar to the first proposal raised in this research, that roll-over on the purchase of another home avoids CGT. For the reasons outlined above, this approach is rejected here. Other design features Evans and Krever outline include the need for care to avoid ‘double-dipping’, by ensuring that the property in question is a genuine residence. Their concern is to limit principle residences to a single home per family unit. 4. CGT double taxes retained earnings held by companies. To the extent that CGT is assessed on gains in the market value of corporate stock, CGT applies double taxation to retained earnings. Under the current regime, dividend imputation credits attach to earnings distributed as dividends. Imputation credits relieve share investor liability to taxation paid by the company, up to the company tax rate. Where a company chooses to retain all or a portion of its earnings (as is typical) those retained 21 Christopher Evans and Richard Krever, Taxing Capital gains: A Comparative analysis and Lessons from New Zealand, 14 Taxation Today. 11 earnings contribute to the value of the shares upon realisation by the shareholder. The effect is that the shareholder is being taxed on what is, in effect, new contributed capital, rather than the income derived from that capital. Conceptually, the company could pay out 100% of earnings and issue new shares to shareholders to provide required capital. There would be no claim on the additional contributed capital by the impost of a CGT. Arguably, this presents a reason to implement a system structuring the CGT to discount the cumulative value of retained earnings from the increase in market value of the investor’s shares, at the point of realisation of those shares. The issue of the double taxation of savings has also been raised but it does not appear to have great merit. Taxation of returns on savings is distinct from the taxation of savings. To illustrate this proposal we might envisage a situation in which a taxpayer owns shares in a company. They hold 10,000 shares and over their eight-year holding period, the shares have risen in value from $1.00 to $8, for a total gain in the value of their shareholding of $7. The shareholder sells their shares after eight years of holding them. Over each of the years of shareholding, the company paid out half of its profit after tax, attaching dividend imputation credits to those dividends at the company tax rate of 28%. The remaining half of each year’s profit was retained and reinvested in the company’s business. If we suppose a simplified scenario, in which the company earned $1,000,000 in year one, rising by 10% a year over each of the eight years this results in total retained earnings of $6,289,739. If we assume that the company’s market capitalisation is $10,000,000 in year one, and that the number of shares on issue has remained constant (again, all simplifying assumptions but none of which importantly distort the principles illustrated), the result is a gain in company value of $70,000,000. Taxed at 28% without an allowance for cumulative retained earnings CGT liability is $19,600,000 against $17,838,873.08 with an allowance for retained earnings 22 . In relation to $6,289,739 of retained earnings, double taxation has occurred. Allowing for retained earnings over the investor’s holding period, would reduce the tax liability to or $17,839 23 . Without the allowance the taxpayer would be liable to CGT of $19,600 24 . 22 This calculation relates to the whole company, implicitly assuming all investors bought and sold their shares at the same time and for the same price. This, naturally, is at best extremely unlikely but is presented in addition to the individual investor’s exposure to CGT. 23 63,710,261 x 0.28 x (1/1000) 24 $7 x 0.28 x 10,000 12 Possible objections to the proposed approach of deducting cumulative retained earnings from the change in market value over the investor’s holding period are likely to be logistical. Those objections may include the costs associated with calculating the retained earnings’ reduction of the capital gain, for the purpose of calculating the net CGT liability. If such an argument relates to cost and, in particular, excessive cost, the recipient of the capital gain would be allowed to avoid its calculation by paying CGT on the full amount. An expected outcome of this is that those receiving capital gains will agree that the cost of calculating the discount is acceptable. The reality is that, at least as it relates to listed companies, or other entities of reasonable size, an expectation of records maintenance sufficient to reveal pre-tax profits, tax on profit, after tax profit and dividends dispersed, is reasonable. Adapting to this incremental compliance impost, certainly post-transition is undemanding. 5. Rate - The erosive effect of inflation on capital gains and the tax deferral effect The main basis to assert the case for a concessional tax rate for capital gains is that inflation erodes the value of capital gains made. If we create a hypothetical scenario in which an investor has made a $46,937 25 gain on an investment in residential property over a five- year period, we can use such a case to illustrate the practical effects of CGT 26 . At the end of the five-year period, the investor sells their residential property. Over that time, the investor has deferred taxation, gaining the benefit of returns on an increased capital base progressively, without the requirement to pay CGT. We may assume an inflation rate in the middle of the RBNZ’s target range of 1-3% or, alternatively, using data averaging the five quarter period 2017, and the first quarter of 2018, we arrive at an average of 1.74%. The benefit of tax deferral is determined at the tax rate supported in this research of 28%, and amounts to that rate multiplied by 0.28. To these assumptions, we will add an assumption of 8% investor returns rate 27 , noting that the practical implications are sensitive to any changes 25 This is arrived at using an annual return of 8%, approximating long-term residential property returns, and assuming negligible net income, after expenses. 26 It should be noted that, while hypothetical, conformity with an approximation to the current situation, in terms of the inflation rate and residential property returns, is observed. The current period is marked by historically low inflation and interest rates. Implicitly treating these values as permanent, biases the calculations (without sign). Low inflation rates weaken the case for differential treatment of capital gains, while low return rates weaken or lessen the argument that deferred taxation represents an offset to the erosion of capital gains due to inflation. Equally, the timeframe may importantly affect the results. 27 The nature of this assumption is supported by long-term investment returns. See: Bart Frijns and Alireza Tourani-Rad, The long-run performance of the New Zealand stock markets: 1899-2012 (Auckland Centre for 13 in one or more of these assumptions. A further assumption, which is for the purposes of simplification, rather than for realism, is that the gains enjoyed by the investor occur in even increments over each of the five years. Notably, depending on the deviation from this assumption the net position of the investor may materially change but without bias. Based on these assumptions the effect on the investor is: • Inflation: This is calculated by determining the present value of $50,000 received as a lump sum in five years’ time, discounted at a rate of 1.74%. A further calculation required is the value of the initial investment in current real terms, at the point of realisation. For this purpose an initial investment of $100,000 is assumed. Of this initial investment 50% is equity and 50% is debt. These levels are assumed constant over the holding period of five years 28 . For simplicity, we can assume 5 annual periods as the basis for calculating the net present value. This provides a value of $46,937. An implication of this is that any tax rate on a nominal $46,937, against a real gain of $138,926.44 29 , entails a higher real rate of taxation. In effect, the tax rate on the full $38,926.44 gain, at $13,142, represents a real rate of 33.76% 30 . • Deferred taxation advantage: As outlined above, to determine the value of tax deferral, we must calculate the value of savings on 28% tax paid at the end of each period over five years. For consistency, we are assuming the incidence of tax liabilities would fall in a similar pattern to the inflation rate but with a delay of one Financial Research, AUT Business School, <www.nzfc.ac.nz/archives/2014/papers/programme/II-2b.pdf>, 2014). Fjirns and Tourani-Rad calculate the long-run return on investment in the New Zealand stock market of 10.75%. Notably, secondary market equities do not represent a major part of New Zealand portfolios and also that the majority of the return is in the form of dividends. In terms of residential property, Chaston, “Adjusting for inflation, the gains in house prices in the past four years are actually nothing special when viewed over a full 50+ year timeframe” Interest.co.nz (May 28, 2017, <www.interest.co.nz/property/87961/adjusting-inflation-gains- house-prices-past-four-years-are-actually-nothing-special>) identifies a long-run return on residential property of 8.2% (median house price). In light of these values, and the case that the investor’s rate of return should be determinative of the implied tax shield effect of tax deferral on capital gains. It is also employed cognisant of 70% of New Zealand wealth held in residential property assets (Robin Oliver “Capital Gains tax- The New Zealand Case’ A Paper prepared for the Fraser Institute 2000 Symposium, on Capital gains Taxation, (September 15-17 2000, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2000)). 28 This simplifying assumption is likely to overstate the level of investor equity at the start of the period which makes the configuration conservative or more likely to find for a preferential rate for CGT. 29 \* PV= ி௩ (ଵା௜) ೙ , where PV is present value, FV is future value, and n is the number of periods. The total return is calculated then $50,000 debt finance is deducted to determine the erosive effects of inflation on an initial investment of $50,000 of investor equity and all of the related returns, occurring evenly across the investment period. 30 Deducting the tax deferral effect results in this adds $2,092 back to the inflation-eroded investor return. 14 year. This allows us to calculate present value over 4 31 periods, at 8%. Multiplying 8% by 0.28 reflects an imputed need to finance the CGT (from a non-divisible asset). We can calculate the value of the tax shield as $2,092. This gives a total value of $41,019. • The net tax effect is an increased tax liability over the nominal rate of 32 % 32 , reducing the tax inflationary effects of taxing capital gains without adjusting for the real gain. Allowing that the risk premium is likely to be conservative in this calculation, and that CGT will largely fall on wealthier taxpayers, this seems to be an ideal outcome. Notably, a large number of assumptions influence the calculus above and at least a number of those assumptions are not likely to be consistently reliable. Important among these are that interest rate spread between the risk free rate and the first mortgage rate remain constant. Notwithstanding, there is substance to the view of those arguing capital gains should be taxed at a lower rate than other income if an equality is to be achieved between the taxation of capital gains and the taxation of other income. However, what becomes clear, under what are a relatively benign set of assumptions for the case for a concessionary CGT rate due to the erosive effects of inflation, is that the relevant rate need not be very much lower. Under the assumption that taxpayers exposed to CGT liability are generally in the top marginal income tax bracket (33%), and in light of the plausible scenario presented above in which real tax rates are only modestly higher on capital gains than they are for other income, 28% is a reasonable approximation to a just and efficient rate of taxation and is the corporate tax rate. This has the ancillary advantage of avoiding the (admittedly minimal) risk of over taxation, due to pushing the CGT liable taxpayer into a higher tax bracket in periods in which they realise capital gains and also minimises differential tax rates and, thus, tax planning opportunities. The proposed CGT regime Tying together the elements outlined in the discussion to this point, the proposed CGT is realisation-based and it involves a tax exemption for part of the capital gains on the sale of primary residences. However, there is a liability to CGT where home capital gains exceed the 31 We assume here, that liability to CGT arises at the end of each period because practical constraints are likely to frustrate collection that is more frequent, whereas the inflation effect arises upon investment. 32 ($38,926.44 + $2,092 = $41,019; $13,142/$41,019 = 32%). 15 exempt amount. The scheme also proposes a reduction in the assessable capital gain by the amount of cumulative retained earnings in companies in which an investor realises capital gains. The CGT rate proposed is 28%, consistent with the company rate, and there is no carryover upon death 33 . Collectively, these elements serve to mitigate very many of the more substantial objections to CGT or to a certain rate of CGT. 33 Notably, Stiglitz, J. Economics and the Public Sector (2 nd ed, Norton, 1986) argues against exempting death as a ‘roll-over’ event, and he identifies it as one of four core principles of a sound CGT system. It is also interesting to note that those arguing for a note of CGT equal to the marginal tax rate also felt the CGT regime should be part of income tax legislation (Survey of experts conducted by Sharma, S. and Davey, H. “Characteristics of a preferred capital gains tax regime in New Zealand”, 21 NZJTLP, 113).

Tax W orking Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 1 Ap ril 2018 Tax Working Group : Submission I s ubmit to the Tax Working Group my thoughts on the future of tax in New Zealand, with a view that it will benefit the many and not the few, through a fairer, simpler, and more efficient tax system. Attached please find:  The future of Tax in New Zealand – Submission (pages 2-5)  Questions & Answers (Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper) - Appendix 2 Design Issues with a capital gains tax (pages 6-7) - Appendix 3 (Questions for Submitters) (pages 8-11)  Additional Appendices – various articles and reports referred to in my submission By way of background, I am a Sharebroker with 32 years’ experience, with prior experience as a qualified accountant working in public practice. I have started up, invested in, closed down and sold out of and continue to run private companies (in New Zealand and offshore) in a range of sectors including IT, biotech, seafood, importing, sharebroking and investments. As a result, I have dealt with the tax system at many levels. Throughout my career, I have always thought:  How can New Zealand operate a tax system that is more efficient, fair and simple - with no room for error?  How can New Zealand operate a system that frees up the time of business owners, investors, individuals and trustees, to focus on the business and not on massive amounts of paperwork? As you outline in the background paper: ‘tax is not just for “experts”’. We all have a stake in the design of our tax system. I have no axes to grind, am not a member of any political party, and have no vested interest apart from being a New Zealand tax payer with a desire for a better and simpler system for the many. These views are my own and are not representative of my employer. You will see from the various appendices in my submission that I have a long-standing interest in tax reform. Relevant sections of these appendices are highlighted to reduce your reading. I accept that major tax reform will take courage to implement and a stomach for heights. I encourage you to be brave for the good of the many, not the few and create a better NZ (the few will be the loudest to say ‘no’ and the many will praise you for common sense and a simpler life). I am happy for the Group and the Secretariat to contact me to discuss the points raised in my submission. F J Gargiulo ACA, AFA \[1\] \[1\] Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 2 The future of Tax in New Zealand I believe New Zealand can operate a tax system that is fairer, more efficient and simple, cuts down on paperwork and minimises room for error. I have observed that issues such as capital gains tax, reducing compliance, and tax leakage repeat over the years, with little having been done to solve them other than “add ons” or trimming around the edges of the existing tax system instead of tackling the issues head on (Appendices 8, 9, 20 and 21 (A20 page 6 onwards – history from 1967 to 1988 on GST). My proposal is for New Zealand to adopt a Turnover Tax System. “... a single point-of-sale tax between companies and companies, companies and individuals, and individuals and individuals. Such a low, fair and consistent method of funding government could easily replace the cacophony of taxes that are stifling trade and commerce in this country today. Let’s just tax the dollar traded, not who or what entity traded it, not why it is traded. Why should companies (groups of individuals) and individuals be taxed at different rates?” (Appendix 1). The rationale behind a Turnover Tax System is as follows:  Tax ALL financial (bank) deposit transactions (Turnover Tax, Appendices 0, 1, 9, and 30 on page 3). To enable this, the government would need to remove all cash from the monetary system (go cashless) so all payments/receipts are processed via a bank (Appendices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 46). Tax would be applied at a rate to be determined when Treasury works out the total cash flow within NZ and amount of FX coming in and going out of NZ (Appendix 36). A Turnover Tax System would:  cut the IRD to a very small unit;  allow accountants and lawyers who specialise in the tax field to apply their expertise to other, more productive sectors;  eliminate tax errors, tax avoidance and tax evasion (Appendices 43 and 45);  eliminate the issues of unpaid taxes (Appendix 22);  get rid of the cash economy and all that goes with it, seal up the leakage;  do away with tax losses carried forward;  help with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) (Appendices 24,25,26,27,28,28A,29,30);  reduce government spending on bank notes and coins;  reduce bank size in terms of space and number of people employed (you will be aware that banks do not wish to have customers in their branches and focus instead on online transactions as is the IRD);  pass all the points of purpose and principals of a good tax system: efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, confidence and administration costs, as outlined in the background paper;  “... be sufficiently robust to deal with future challenges and sufficiently nimble to take advantage of opportunities”, a requirement outlined in the background paper;  having no exemptions and a single tax rate creates a relatively simple system (simpler than GST which has a few exceptions);  actually collect tax as it’s on a cash flow basis (you wouldn’t be able to avoid paying tax through evasion or an avoidance arrangement);  ensure households and businesses have appropriate incentives to work, save, innovate and invest; Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 3  have a high level of compliance (self-compliance once the system is in place);  being cashless eliminates armed robberies, burglaries, break-ins etc which is a saving in both cost, stress and police time;  deal with cash flow (which is fact) versus profit/loss (which is an opinion);  shows movement of funds via the banking system whereas cash can be untraceable;  would reduce the cost of tax compliance (Appendix 21). It deals with tax on a real time basis as opposed to assessing what people did last year and what they might do this year. Further, I propose a Turnover Tax System which would have a single tax rate which avoids splitting income between family members, trusts and company structures. Everyone would be on a single tax rate which saves both time and money (Appendix 33). It should be noted that South Africa has a Turnover Tax System in place. Its system has thresholds and different tax scales whereas my proposal is for a single rate tax paid monthly. As with any system, there will always be pitfalls. I am sure the Working Group will be able to identify and address these. To elaborate on the case for a Turnover Tax System further:  Under a Turnover Tax System, banks and financial institutions end up being the tax collectors as they currently are with RWT on gross interest. This system would do away with ALL the other various taxes we currently have and would eliminate tax returns – PAYE, GST, FBT, Provisional Tax etc. It removes all other tax related paperwork, and the compliance that goes with it, but would open the gates to taxing anything deposited which will expand the tax base (it would be a capital gains tax, estate tax, inheritance tax and the list goes on) (Appendices 8,9,10,11 and 48).  The system would free up business owners to work on their business rather than tax related paperwork that they have no interest in, and which doesn’t help them run a better or more profitable business. Furthermore, business owners often need to rely on tax professionals to help them with the tax component which adds additional business costs (Appendices 12, 13). The paperwork also deters people from starting their own business because it is complicated, onerous and time consuming (Appendix 8, page 3).  The points that need to be considered with any change in tax rates are the flow on effects. Getting rid of all other taxes would reduce the prices of goods and services (15% GST) and flow on effects of inflation. Will businesses pass on wage increases as tax rates drop or keep it for themselves? If businesses’ profits increase, will we get a boom period of spending etc?  The current tax system does not create wealth for New Zealand, or for the tax payer, as no value is created from data collection and filling in forms (Appendix 14). However, it does provide a living for the sector of society that administers it. Under the Turnover Tax System, this sector would need to refocus its business model, or move on to other things that add value (Appendices 8, 9).  We currently place a large burden on tax payers in a number of areas that are often subjective requiring them to engage with professionals which can prove costly and without guarantee the IRD may disagree with such advice at a later stage. Tax payers do not want to feel they need an honours degree in law and accounting to understand the rules of a tax system (Appendix 16). Further, the courts should be dealing with criminals, not ruling on who is right or wrong on a subjective matter (it adds no value). Why do we continue to do this to our people when it is clearly wrong? (Appendices 10, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 30). Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 4  People have suffered personal health and financial issues which have ruined lives (and in some cases resulted in jail time). This results in a loss-loss situation for the person concerned, their family, their business and staff, and the wider community (Appendices 19, 23, 44 and 47). This reinforces my point that we need a simpler tax system that stops this from happening. Tax changes do alter people’s behaviour and where the system is simpler, the result is better (Appendices 10, 28, 30, 31 and 32).  Tax payers want certainty. The Government recently brought in laws that are very clear on property and include - no offsetting losses and the “5 years” rule. This is what Turnover Tax is all about – a clear and simple system. The government gets the tax paid monthly without the hassles, which helps its cash flow and therefore the country in general. (Appendices 34 and 35.)  We need a simple system which gets away from tax schemes, and tax driven investments, which only encourages tax payers to invest in them as a way of avoiding paying higher rates of tax (Appendix 40). If the IRD decides to challenge the tax scheme this will amount to a cost to the rest of the community (less tax revenue) and more cost to the tax payer.  Turnover Tax would remove the bad taste in the mouths of investors with imputation/franking related to Trans-Tasman investing that needs to be addressed. Trying to do business across the pond is very hard and most stop trying (I did!). (Appendix 41).  If Turnover Tax can be implemented, it will encourage overseas companies to do business here because the tax system is simple, there are no tricks and the tax rate would be low. NZ could become the ‘Switzerland of the Pacific’. Craig Heatley sums it up so well: “We are at the bottom of the world so we need to be better than everyone else to be considered by investors.” (Appendix 42).  I have spoken with people who have worked in the IRD’s audit/investigation team in the past and they believe this type of system is what is required on so many levels. Some time ago when I presented my ideas to an economist, he commented as follows: “With regards to your simplified tax structure, while I feel has much to commend it – like getting rid of accountants – I think its two major shortcomings are: 1. The incentive to invest beyond NZ in order to avoid tax – this might reduce the tax base as much as the capture of the black economy would expand it. 2. Tax is used not just to fund government but also to redistribute wealth/income – this is where progressivity of income tax comes from. Your tax would have no progressivity in it – although, of course, you can get it effectively by giving handouts to the less well off. Apart from that I can see beauty in its simplicity.”  This was followed up with a further email: “I suspect the idea’s a dead letter. Since I sent you that last email a third avoidance occurred to me – simply avoiding the banking system that is building up non-bank credits and debits at some non-banking intermediary. All you’d have to have is a deposit somewhere in trust to cover your net liabilities so I suspect across the three channels there’d be too big an undermining of the tax base.” I believe the Economist’s comments above can be made to work and are not deal breakers. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 5 Observations on Tax Generally  With R&D tax credits, cash rebates rather than tax offsets, smaller companies do not make a profit so there is no benefit from the offset and only benefits to profitable companies. If the government decides to help in this area that can be dealt with outside the tax system. As stated above, the new tax system would ignore tax losses and encourage businesses to become profitable immediately.  The IRD (therefore NZ Inc) loses over $200m a year from liquidations. They close more businesses than anyone else because of unpaid taxes and manage billions of late tax payments (Appendix 22). A Turnover Tax System would eliminate this and the issue would be dealt with at the time, otherwise the doors get shut (you can’t pay you don’t play). I say pay now (PAYG) and not later. With the current tax system you do not know what is around the corner. With the Turnover Tax System you are up to date monthly (and any issues should be very small).  AIM (accounting income method) has started for small businesses. This is a take-off from the Turnover Tax System, without all the features, and is all about cash flow. It goes only part of the way and should be implemented for all tax payers. While we can see the advantages of the system now, we have to think bigger and better.  There is more than $1.35 billion laundered in New Zealand each year (Appendix 29). Under a Turnover Tax System all these transactions will be taxed; increase the tax take, along with cash jobs (which would be eliminated) as all transactions have to be via a bank account.  The likes of the Amazon tax issue will be dealt with when funds are moved off shore via FX so retailers are on a level playing field under the Turnover Tax System (Appendix 38).  Digital tax on turnover that Google, Facebook and Apple etc. will face, is the way of the future in my view, as sectors change. If we are to believe that the tech world will do away with our jobs then the tax system needs to be at the forefront of the changes to ensure the tax base is not eroded. Future government expenditure will only increase with the likes of health, pensions and unemployment. (Appendix 0).  Another area of concern is how to address cryptocurrencies. There will be more of these types of products in the future (and products yet to be invented). Under Turnover Tax they will be taxed on the way out and when coming back in via bank accounts (if they do actually come back in to the system) (Appendix 37).  The IRD manages social policy initiatives such as Student Loans, KiwiSaver and Working for Families. Are these initiatives merged with the Turnover Tax System or are they moved to another department?  To round this all off, the penalties that will need to be put in place with a Turnover Tax System must be tough and not open to the courts’ interpretation. They must be easy to understand by the many so the system is simple and clear to follow. There is no grey in a very black and white system. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 6 My input to the questions you are seeking answers (Future of Tax –Submissions Background paper) are based on Turnover Tax System vs. current tax system. APPENDIX 2 – Design issues with a capital gains tax If you think the Group should design a capital gains tax (CGT) for Government consideration, we need your feedback now on a number of detailed design issues: • Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. Yes, CGT should be implemented as part of the overall Turnover Tax system as it is central to widening the tax base and lowering the tax rate. (Appendix 48). • Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? Only when assets are sold and funds are banked as part of the overall system as I have outlined. Matrimonial settlements should be excluded, but any cash banked is taxed as is with winding up of an estate or trust. • What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? All assets should be covered no with exceptions. Exceptions cause a breakdown and tax payers know the rules which are plain and simple when assets are sold. • Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? Yes. When funds are banked into the various schemes going in, and when funds are banked on their way out of the various schemes to the savers bank accounts in a lump sum or as pension etc. These should be taxed. • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Only when the assets are sold and banked. Any funds moved offshore will be taxed when the FX transaction is done and if and when funds come back to NZ. • How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? With the Turnover Tax System these taxes are no longer applicable. • When should non-residents be subject to tax? When funds are banked into a NZ bank account and again when funds are transferred out of the country when a FX transaction is done. • Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. No. Whatever is banked is taxed. • Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? No. Contra deals need to be accounted for and taxed as the Turnover Tax System I propose is all about the flow of funds. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 7 • How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? All should be subject to tax. • How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Yes. Funds will be banked and will pass through a bank account and be subject to the Turnover Tax System. • What should the rate of tax on tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? Under the Turnover Tax System, I propose a single tax rate (to be determined by Treasury). • Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? No. We are trying to make this a system that runs without input, is clear, simple and tax payers understand the rules. It should be black or white – no grey areas. • Should there be a de minimis rule? No. It adds no value and exemptions create issues. • What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? None. The Turnover Tax Systems has no exemptions and is self-regulated. • What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). No rules apply. What is banked is taxed at the single tax rate. • How should family trusts be integrated into the system? The same way as companies and individuals under the Turnover Tax System – a single tax rate which is standard for any funds banked. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 8 APPENDIX 3 – Questions for submitters Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? • That the tax system becomes like all the other tax systems in the world, hard to follow, understand, subjective and unbalanced. We need to spread the tax base as wide as possible. In order to do this it needs to be simple and easy to administer, freeing up people’s time to work in and on their businesses without them having to do all the paperwork (which does not add to the growth of NZ). How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? • Yes. Implement the Turnover Tax System. One people, one tax system based on one rate of tax for all. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? • By embracing a “one people, one tax system” where all New Zealanders are treated fairly and equally. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? • Simple, easy to understand and follow, not subjective, as wide a tax base as possible, not time consuming for the tax payer, a system with no exemptions, a system that has no slippage, a system that is fair to all tax payers. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? • All members of society are paying their fair share of tax. This ensures NZ Inc operates as a decent and caring society with a tax base that is as wide as possible. Tax payers are incentivised to work hard knowing they are being treated fairly. They will be happy to contribute as they have a low tax rate and a tax system that manages itself without unnecessary and time- consuming paperwork. A system that caters for all in society. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? • No. Our current system has been described as simple when comparing with systems around the world but I feel it can be even simpler if a Turnover Tax System was implemented. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 9 Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? • Yes. With the Turnover Tax System all business owners would be over the moon. With a simple and easily understood system there is no room for misunderstanding. Combined with a system that is not subjective, tax payers would feel in control and will not be worried about an future outcomes that may come back to bite them due to professional opinions they may or may not have received. Tax payers will spend more time doing what they are good at, ie running their businesses for profit and having more leisure time. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? • No. Vested interests will tell you otherwise, but the Turnover Tax System should encourage this itself. If you apply this to retirement I would suggest you need to open the gates to education and health. All of these need to stand on their own merit and having a tax system as outlined provides for this as part of an overall package. I am of the view that save as you go (SAYG), so you can pay as you go (PAYG) when the time comes. Tax is paid SAYG and when you PAYG the tax is again paid when those funds reach a bank account, however, this time they bear the tax whereas with SAYG you would bear the cost. Remember, tax is taken again when the funds reach a bank account. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? • No. The Turnover Tax System I have outlined will achieve this balance and remove the pitfalls of the current system. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? • No. The current system has only added to business expenditure in terms of cost plus wasted time for the tax payer. Further this could be even more expensive if they make an error. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? • No. But a wider tax base would increase revenue allowing the Government to implement policies in this area which in the past has been neglected. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? • Yes. High depreciation type companies, the IT sector, marine farms and property companies etc. • With the Turnover Tax System this is all done away with as it is funds banked with no deductions that tax is applied to (saving costs and time). The tax payer can claim whatever cost they think they require to run a successful and profitable business, but under the Turnover Tax System who cares, as tax only applies to funds banked. This again takes away the subjective element and I would suggest there would be fewer costs as a result as there is no point in giving it a go to try and get a deduction and maybe argue it later (with this system there is no “argue later”). In the Turnover Tax System there are no tax losses carried forward and it’s in your best interests to get the business profitable as soon as possible as you are still paying taxes on funds banked. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 10 Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? • Subjective decisions that are required to be made by the tax payer, Foreign Investment Funds (FIF) and Fair Dividend Rate (FDR). Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? • Yes. One tax that covers all funds banked and funds transferred in and out of the country. Do away with all the taxes we currently have leaving this final tax so tax payers have no further liability apart from a contra deal that will need to be accounted for. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? • By changing to a Turnover Tax System the costs of goods and services would drop by 15% which will help with affordability at the same time widening the tax base to make it a fairer tax system. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Should NZ introduce a capital gains tax – YES (as part of a Turnover Tax System) and based on there being no exemptions creating a fairer and simpler tax system. Should the capital gains tax exclude the family home – NO (as part of a Turnover Tax System). • We already have a capital gain tax with the new bright line test (the rules are simple if you sell before 5 years, its taxable, end of story). If the IRD proposals are adopted real estate investors will lose the tax loophole from April 2019, and their ability to offset losses on residential properties to reduce their tax on other income. The IRD’s argument is those expenses in fact relate to the capital gain so those expenses should not be deductible unless the capital gain is taxed. • The Turnover Tax System cuts through all this and believes that investors will change the way they invest in the future. We need to put fairness back into the system in my view. There is story in the media (Stuff 24/3/18 by tax expert Chris Wales – Appendix 39) that the Prime Minister will turn down a capital gains tax (but government has not seen what a new tax system would be able to do). To accept a capital gains tax on the current tax system would be for the government to be kicked to touch. Therefore we know the likely result of getting a capitals gains tax. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? • No. As above, anything banked is taxed. Tax Working Group Submission :: FJ Gargiulo 11 Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? • The Turnover Tax System is based on the flow of cash and makes no distinction across sectors or boarders which is the way it should be. (See Appendix A0 on digital tax on EU turnover.) Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? • No, one tax for all tax payers, no difference - one tax, one people. Wealthy people and the biggest companies will pay the bulk of the tax as is the case now (all related to cash flow). A progressive company tax would not improve the tax system or business environment in my view. Tax is a business cost that must be allowed for and accounted for. In the Turnover Tax System it is simple, easy to understand and the tax rate will be lower than what is currently the case so would be no need for this. GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? • No. As stated above I would eliminate all taxes. A Turnover Tax System is the same as GST without exemptions - simple, straight forward, easy to understand, and eliminates tax payers having to be involved in the calculation or payment of tax. • Benefits to the tax payers are many, as are the benefits to the government. They get monthly payments, reduced compliance, a streamlined IRD, catch all cash flow in the system, reduce leakage, and it widens the tax base. • Overseas companies would be keen to set up business in NZ as the tax system is simple, easy to understand and the tax rate would be low as a result of taxing all the cash flows. • We would get all the bright people working in the tax sector taking on roles that would benefit from their huge brain power. This helps the country and business sectors as they are not playing the tax system (which only benefits the few at the cost of the many). It may put some people out of work but that work is costing NZ Inc a lot of money that could be better invested in making the bus go faster.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 2018 Tax Working Group submission Background “Ladies and gentlemen: it is my belief that New Zealand has ample supplies of water.” \[Hon Jim Sutton MP, address at launch of NZ Irrigation Association, 21 Sept 2001\] “Agriculture uses 77% of abstracted water in New Zealand” \[Hon Jim Sutton MP, speech to Dairy Farmers of NZ meeting, 17 June 2002\] “New Zealand’s waters are a limited, fragile resource coming under increasing pressure from farming activities, both in terms of the effects on water quality and the increasing demand for water. Although pollution of rivers from point sources ... has declined over the last 20 to 30 years, pollution from non-point sources is a major and increasing problem. Farming has been identified as the main source of pressure on water quality in New Zealand.” \[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Growing for Good, 2004\] " ... the most significant issues are freshwater consumption and land use intensification in some regions, water quality in many catchments, and greenhouse gas emissions. The trends indicate that, if we do not change current paths, we risk hitting environmental limits or effects that are irreversible or very costly to remedy." \[Ministry for the Environment, Briefing to the Incoming Government 2008: Environmental Sustainability\] “The Prime Minister has always said that his government would not put environmental requirements ahead of our economy.” \[Hon David Carter, Minister of Agriculture, speech to Federated Farmers conference, 2009\] "The reality is that the present intensive dairy farming modus operandi is not sustainable. We are really just mining the environment." \[Dr Mike Joy, Squandered: the Degradation of New Zealand's Freshwaters, 2015\] The need for a water resource rental Every politician understands that the government’s revenue take is a finite amount. Yet most fail to understand – or deliberately ignore – the fact that natural resources like water are equally limited; if too much is taken there will be huge problems. The imposition of a water resource rental levy offers a potential solution. Irrigators' free lunch Water is the last major New Zealand resource to be turned to profit. The first two were gold and native timber, both worked out long ago. Despite the lessons from the past, successive governments have provided business with a subsidy by allowing the environment to be exploited without charge. Although New Zealand rural water users pay infrastructure and some administrative costs, they do not pay rent for the water they take from the public estate. One commentator notes: "The exemption from paying rent for water applies generally, ... but the major beneficiaries of this policy are irrigators. Accordingly, the major practical consequence of maintaining a 'free water' policy is to encourage land use intensification with its associated (largely unregulated) environmental impacts." \[Guy Salmon, Governance of the Rural Environment - Are Existing Approaches Working?, Environmental Defence Society conference paper 2008\] The McLeod Tax Committee Report noted the increasing pressure on NZ water resources in 2001. The committee noted freeriders who have benefited financially by taking public resources without any direct cost will always attempt to preserve their privileged positions: “4.4 ... new measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts are never easy to implement, since they require existing users to forgo or restrict activities previously taken for granted. These groups will often vigorously resist the introduction of environmentally superior solutions." Before the 2017 election, farmers deliberately tried to confuse the water royalty debate by alleging Labour’s proposed charge would not improve water quality. But if NZ farmers owned the nation’s water resources, would they allow the government to use that water without paying for it? The answer is obvious, which is why no-one from the rural sector can offer a tenable response. Submission: The rural sector should pay a reasonable rental for use of water rather than being allowed to stealthily privatize a finite public resource. The impost would not be a tax but a resource rental levy (a tax requires a person to give up a portion of their property or money. By comparison, farmers and irrigators do not own the water they take; they merely receive a licence to use it). Reasons are as follows: 1. New Zealand’s environment is the nation’s natural capital. As such, it must be preserved and enhanced for the benefit of future generations. A resource rental for those rural businesses which seek to use water (subject to environmental constraints) would advance the idea of trusteeship of an important national asset. 2. A minerals resource rental has successfully been applied in Australia; minerals of course also being finite in nature. 3. Equity considerations require the New Zealand public obtain a fair return when private enterprise seeks to profit from use of a public asset. 4. A resource rental levy would help counter the current distortion in rural land investment patterns, which sees investments motivated by capital appreciation instead of operating returns.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 30 April 2017 Submission to the Review on the Future of Tax Review overview I see taxes as collective action to fund our social goals as a community. Parliamentary democracy is how we decide how to spend our own tax revenue – with occasional public consultation. I dislike the ‘four capitals’ framework which looks society with an economist’s eye, as if it were just the sum of individual ‘investments’. I prefer a framework that starts from our values, identifies social goals and then looks for ways to fund them. My top picks for New Zealand values are equality and love of our environment. As at 2017-18, that has put poverty and climate change at the top of the agenda. How will our tax system best fund effective policy action on these? The present government is committed to a greener economy, action on inequality (minimum wage, pay equity negotiations, benefits review) and affordable housing. These will all require upfront expenditure, though some will also raise tax revenue and benefit the economy (and society). I feel Labour and the Greens shot themselves in the foot with the Budget Responsibility rules. However, I attended a pre-election meeting at which they promised to look at taxing wealth as well as income. I welcome that, although it will affect me personally. In the next term of government I expect that there will be new and perhaps higher taxes. New Zealand needs leadership on some serious issues, and we’ll need to pay the piper. Terms of Reference Of the objectives set out in the Terms of Reference, two points appeal to me particularly. The first is that wealth as well as income should be treated fairly for taxation purposes. The second is our tax system should be not only efficient, fair and simple, but also collected. It is shocking that so many people should be prosecuted for overpayments of benefits while so few companies are prosecuted for much greater underpayments of tax. 1 I am also concerned about money leaving the country untaxed through various brand royalty or interest loopholes manipulated by overseas companies or private equity funds. It has become a norm of global accounting for money to spiral through whatever country/ies offer opportunities to reduce tax or regulation or provide anonymity. 2 When 50% of 2Degrees can be acquired by a company created the week before and registered at an Amsterdam airport address with 760-odd others 3 , something is wrong. Signing the Multilateral Convention to prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting is a great step forward, but I am unclear what New Zealand is doing on that as it is excluded from the Review. 1 Marriott, L, and Sim, D, ‘Tax Evasion and Welfare Fraud: Do punishments fit the crime or the perception of the crime?’ Pacific Accounting Review, (2017), 29, 4, pp. 573-589; Marriott, L, ‘An Investigation of Attitudes towards Tax Evasion and Welfare Fraud in New Zealand’, The Australian New Zealand Journal of Criminology, (2017), 50, 1, pp. 123-145. 2 BBC (2013) The Tax Free Tour 2013. https://topdocumentaryfilm.com 3 Cafca, OIO Decisions, June 2017. http://www.canterbury.cyberplace.co.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca17/fi-2017-06.html 2 Also excluded is the interaction of the tax system with ‘transfers’, as if income support was not a major social purpose and part of the equity and fairness objective of taxation. Tax rate codes, child benefits and credits like Working for Families are as much part of the tax system as they are part of the benefit system. I agree strongly with the Background Paper at p.20 that ‘it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes’. Particularly given the current government’s stated aim to reduce poverty. The government also needs to reconsider the wider context of economic policy settings and labour relations deregulation over the past three decades that have increased the need for transfers and redistributive taxes. Impact analysis by gender, ethnicity, socio-economics I expect a Review of the tax system to analysis the impact of proposed tax strategies by gender and ethnicity as well as socio-economics. Gender budgeting, i.e. analysing fiscal policy to promote gender equality, is supported by the OECD, UN, ILO and IMF and undertaken in over 80 countries. The way forward is shown by a paper recently published by Treasury that reviewed the 2016 Tax Expenditure Statement, which lacking any gender specific analysis but included a number of expenditures with potentially negative impact on gender equality. 4 An area of major expenditure for the government over the next year or three will be the outcomes of a series of pay equity claims being negotiated across the state sector. A Tax Review Report that includes gender analysis will be relevant and timely. It does appear likely that such an impacts analysis will be carried out with regard to Māori. The fact sheet highlights what ‘the Māori economy’ can do for the tax system. Chapter 2 of the Background Paper does also acknowledge on-going inequalities (p.11) – but sees disparities in educational, employment and income as a risk to funding superannuation (p.10), rather than as a risk to Māori themselves. I expect the Tax Review Report will suggest tax policies that might help remedy current inequalities for Māori and Pacifika communities. Principles for assessment and fairness • Enough revenue to fund health, education, income support and superannuation services that work for everyone. • Everyone contributes their share at progressive rates on income, together with taxes on wealth (capital gains, inheritance, gifts). • All companies operating in NZ pay at least 30% tax on profits, whether they are local, global or cyberspace companies. • Review and analysis of taxation impacts by gender, ethnicity and socio-economics. • A tax to GDP rate within the range of other OECD countries. • Serious international action to coordinate tax rates, and prevent base erosion, profit shifting and tax havens. 4 S. Morrissey (2018) Gender Budgeting: A useful approach for Aotearoa New Zealand. NZ Treasury Working Paper 18/02. 3 Taxing wealth as well as income New Zealand has one of the oldest publicly-funded education, health and income support systems in the world. Earlier generations built our welfare state and labour policies for a more equal society. But this has been eroded over the past 40 years by two main factors: • Unemployment, casualised employment, labour relations deregulation, falling real wages and gender pay gaps, which impact on some sectors of society more than others; 5 • Financial speculation and wealth accumulation without taxation, which benefits some sectors of society more than others, including intergenerational benefits. 6 I support the need to tax wealth as well as income (and other policies) to reduce inequality.. This can be done through the following three forms of tax, working together and treating all investments equally. The Terms of Reference exclude inheritance tax, but the intergenerational inequalities of wealth accumulation cannot be reduced without it. • A capital gains tax on sale of assets This should be at a high rate if assets are sold within 2 years, a lower rate if sold within 2-5 years, then none. Its purpose is to slow speculation (see below) but not longer term investment/ownership. It should apply to housing; land (including farms and forests); commercial property; shares and other financial assets; and other defined assets such as gold, art etc. It should exclude sales of cars and boats below, say, $100,000. It can be implemented at the time of sale via lawyers/real estate and other agents/brokers, etc. Housing includes owner-occupied ‘family homes’. These could be taxed at a lower rate than other housing assets, especially initially. However, they should continue to attract asset tax beyond 5 years if sold for more than, say, double the median national house price. This is to prevent distortions and avoidance of asset tax (‘super’ houses as wealth sinks). House sale taxes will slow speculation in Auckland housing market in particular, supporting regional development goals. Sale means changes of ownership of the asset and also changes of ownership/major shareholding of any company holding the assets (based on information from NZX and the Overseas Investment Office). This will encourage longer term investment in the productive economy, rather than speculation by (overseas) owners of land/commercial property/ business assets. Not an annual ownership tax on assets. This would administratively difficult, values would be ‘market’ guesswork, whereas sale established a real current price. It would irritate people on an annual basis. Most people will not have the money to pay the tax until the asset is sold, anyway. No compensation for losses on asset sales. The government should certainly not pay compensation or allow a tax credit. If the value of assets goes down, that is no different from a car devaluing as it ages. The government does not compensate employees if their current job pays less than their last one. The purpose is to tax incoming money whether it is from earnings or assets. 5 M. Rashbrooke (ed) (2013) Inequality: A New Zealand crisis. BWB; S. Groot et al. (2017) Precarity; Uncertain, insecure and unequal lives in Aotearoa NZ. Massey. The Background Paper notes difficulty collecting income tax in the precariat economy. 6 T. Picketty (2014) Capital in the 21 st Century. Harvard. 4 • Inheritance tax, including on the family home (death duty/estate tax). This is a transfer of ownership similar to an asset sale. It could be at a very low rate initially, then more at progressive rates. Most countries have some form of inherence tax. Its purpose is to slow growing inequality through intergenerational transfer of wealth, and widen the tax base. Low and progressive rates will allow the average family to still leave the kids a house deposit. Lawyers applying for probate can be required to send information to IRD. It will provide an ongoing source of data about the distribution of wealth in New Zealand. • Gift tax on money or assets. This will need to be reintroduced to avoid assets being gifted rather than taxed as inheritance or asset sales. The rate will need to be similar. Gift tax was only removed in 2011 (for party political reasons, I believe, following the Brethren/BRT/racing industry electoral spending scandal). At that time it was 12% on sums over $27,000 a year. Perhaps it did not generate much revenue at that time, because it was cheaper to the kids wait till you died, or perhaps sell them assets for $1, with no tax. I have owned, then sold a few homes over the years, and accumulated capital in this way (mainly because I paid off mortgages asap). I intend to leave my house and any remaining financial assets to younger family members. I would consider the above tax regime to be fair. Tax on both income and wealth accumulation is a fair way of funding our shared social goals, including greater equality. Capital Gains Tax to slow speculative bubbles Taxation can be an important tool to discourage speculation, not merely ‘balance’ the productive and financial economies. The Auckland housing crisis is more than a social problem or ‘supply and demand’. It is a speculative bubble waiting to burst. The Global Financial Crisis was the crash of financial speculation in mortgage and other financial asset. The productive economy gives us jobs, tax revenue and export earnings or savings on imports. Speculation gives wealth to those who have it already or can borrow-and-leverage, and gives us little tax, relatively few jobs, and a financial crisis every 10 years. The financial services sector should support the productive economy, not replace it in driving the economy. The government should support to the productive economy, and use regulation and taxation to reduce the booms and busts of speculation. Capital gains tax, on all assets including houses as suggested above, is an important way to slow speculation, and encourage long term investment in home ownership and in the productive economy. A capital gains tax on housing would, if anything, increase the supply of houses, as developers (including non-residents and overseas investment companies) would focus on building new houses, with a price and a profit, but no capital gain to be taxed. Capital gains on land and business assets that can be remitted offshore by overseas investors ought to attract a higher tax rate of capital gains tax. The existing OIO system and requirements can provide the information base for this, including proportion of overseas ownership. If New Zealand residents pay a higher rate of tax on foreign investments, shouldn’t non-resident investors in New Zealand pay a higher rate of tax on income from shares? Do they? (There must be an ‘equal treatment’ argument here somewhere.) 5 Taxing Kiwis an annual tax on assets in New Zealand if they go overseas is a really bad idea – then they’ll never come home! But if they sell their New Zealand assets, they should be liable for capital gains tax – but perhaps not at the higher rate I just suggested for non-citizens/overseas companies. Crypto currencies may have started as an alternative to a corrupt banking system but they are now just another speculative market, subject to crashes. Crypto-capital gains should be taxed, if you can work out how. In real New Zealand dollars. Not a land tax I strongly support an asset tax at the time of the sale of property, rather than an annual tax on land. We already pay a form of ‘land rent’ to local governments 7 , which are increasingly under the direction of national government, so I think there is already enough land tax. Land tax is proposed by some as the basis of an entire alternative tax system, not an additional tax as here. Interesting, but I’ve seen no suggestions on how Māori land would be treated. The Background Paper suggests a land tax ‘excluding land under the family home’ – how does that work for collectively-owned turangawaewae land under Māori homes? Historically, land taxes/rates have been a way of commercialising Māori land and separating them from it for Pakeha settlement. A government announcement of a land tax would be a political disaster. Company taxes The company tax rate should be returned from 28% to 33%. For any appearance of fairness, company tax should be at least equal to the top personal tax. Businesses benefit from state-funded infrastructure (roads, comms, legal system, educated workforce, etc.), at least as much as their employees rely on state-funded education, health care and welfare that subsidises low wages and casualisation. Businesses are then able to set their costs off against tax, and pass on most of their GST, whereas we ‘end users’ living on wages and salaries can’t. Figure 5 of the Background Paper makes it very clear who is contributing most. If New Zealand’s company tax rate is higher than the OECD average, or even the highest, that’s fine. We should not bid for the bottom, to be a temporary tax haven. That said, progressive company rates above the personal tax rate seem worth exploring. The rates should be based on total revenue/turnover, then applied to the profit after costs. A lower rate for small companies may help them invest more in establishment and growth, whereas companies with larger turnover are past that point. Big companies or subsidiaries with small profits should be investigated, not rewarded. I expect new rules about the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting will help.. The tax system should be simple and efficient, but it should not be Inland Revenue’s business to worry about ‘minimising costs for business’. They have IT systems and accountants. As noted above, it is Inland Revenue’s business to worry more about tax enforcement. I very strongly support all efforts to ensure that offshore and cyberspace companies operating in New Zealand pay their fair share of taxes in New Zealand. I look forward to hearing more about Inland Revenue’s work under the BEPS Convention and other international work. 7 Historically and theoretically, charges for local government services to properties (roading, drains, rubbish) but now based on assessed capital values of land and improvements. 6 Finance sector must pay GST I only recently realised that banks and other financial services get away with not paying GST like the rest of us – just because they can take fees straight out of our account instead of invoicing us? That needs fixing right now. I don’t see it as at all administratively complex for IRD to require a GST payment of 15% on their turnover less costs. Unless the banks themselves devise a better way. Low value imported goods: Collecting GST on internet purchases from overseas may be less cost- effective than asking the banks for theirs, but still possible and important. Low value imported goods is how US-based Amazon makes billions without paying GST or company tax in any other country, while undercutting their local businesses. If just asking Amazon doesn’t work, there might be an IT solution for GST on low value imported good via our banks. New Zealand banks charge percentages and small fees on all overseas credit card transactions in foreign currency. IRD could require banks to add GST on small overseas transactions by New Zealand residents who are not currently out of the country. Banks could add GST automatically to all small overseas transactions unless we inform them of the dates we’ll be away. Like court fines, only in reverse. Perhaps it’s a question for the government’s Data Integration Project. ‘Nudge’ behaviour or regulate? Tax and the environment A tax on carbon would have been more effective than the present emissions trading scheme, which was designed to fail – both here and in the EU. I regret that we didn’t go for a carbon tax in 2005 as a broad base way of reducing emissions across industry and agriculture, with the proceeds perhaps ring-fenced for public transport, etc. As currently with emissions trading, a carbon tax could still allow polluters to buy their way of the problem, not fix it. The issue is too important. The government has strong public support for action on all forms of environmental pollution. We need to back up emissions trading or tax with stricter regulation and greater investment in enforcement, and recoop costs through really hefty fines that concentrate minds. Increases in tax on specific products may not work well to change company behaviour; they can pass them on to consumers. Tax/price increases can work to shift consumer behaviour, though, by changing the environment in which they make small decisions. Alcohol research has shown tax to be one of the most effective policies to reduce alcohol-related harm; young people and heavy drinkers are particularly sensitive to price. 8 A tax on sugary drinks would work in a similar way 9 , and could be administered in much the same way as excise tax – through the small number of drinks producers or importers. The companies might like to look socially responsible, if offered a combination of sugar reduction, tax or regulation with fines. Similarly, a tax on plastic bottles and cans raising the price of drinks might discourage consumers and reduce bottle waste by, say, 10%. Or, for 100%, you could regulate the companies to 8 Babor et al. (2005) Alcohol: No ordinary commodity. OUP. The other effective policies are restrictions on availability (including age) and on marketing. 9 World Health Organization (2016) Fiscal policies for diet and the prevention of noncommunicable diseases. http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/fiscal-policies-diet-prevention/en/ 7 go back to using glass/recycled glass within five years... if the global drink industries didn’t have more influence and money than small governments. No GST on fresh fruit and vegetables only Reductions in tax/price can also influence consumer behaviour. Removing GST on locally grown fresh fruit and vegetables would have real health benefits 10 , particularly among low socio-economic groups including children and young people. There should continue to be GST on packaged fruit and vegetable products (tomato sauce, frozen peas, chips). This could work through retailers of fresh fruit and vegetables (not importing or manufacturing companies) and the existing GST system, which is built into bookkeeping software. Supermarkets and fruit and vegetable venders (only) would not be the ‘end users’ paying GATl. Instead, they would report the GST they pay to suppliers and receive a tax credit from IRD. Universal superannuation, not tax perks Taxation should not be used to subsidise individualised retirement savings or savings scheme, which compete against the tax-funded one. Those with capital or with wages high enough to save or invest should not therefore be asked to pay less tax. That would produce still greater inequality than at present, and eventually a ‘poor house’ pension. Our taxes now should be used to support people in their old age now – the way it has always been done in New Zealand. My father used to wax apoplectic about past individualised retirement funds that failed him (both state and private). Collective responsibility and university entitlement for health, education and welfare services is what works. We should value and maintain the collectively-funded universal system we’ve got. What undermines it at present is a low wage economy with an increasingly casualised workforce, where companies pay low taxes and global multinationals none at all - so that is what need to change. With a bit more than a nudge. Of course, funding superannuation and income support is a also matter of Budget priorities – e.g. we could avoid 20 year programmes of military spending. Future of tax and income National superannuation is the successful working model for a universal basic income. If we really believe that the ‘gig economy’ (i.e. casualisation) and the world’s work done by robots is inevitable, then the government needs to include a universal basic income among its tools to prevent an ever- diminishing spiral in tax revenue. We can’t leave the future to individual savings or living in cardboard boxes.

The framework I strongly support the framework Treasury is now using, of the four capitals. For several decades I have been advocating moving away from GDP growth as the sole aim of economic management. In budget 2,000 a tiny fund was secured by the Green Party in negot iation with Labour, for Dept Statistics to start work on an alternative system of national accounts using resource accounting principles. Not much was ever heard publicly about it but I understand the work was continued beyond that initial funding - I think it was only $750,000 - and has gradually become part of Treasury thinking. 2. Eco taxes NZ is somewhat behind other countries in adopting the principle of taxing environmental bads rather than productive goods. This would include scarce resources and pollution. A carbon price is an obvious place to start but glaring omissions are taxes on water, waste and various discharges. A good surrogate for nitrous oxide pollution (major greenhouse gas) which is very hard to measure on farm, would be an input tax on urea which drives unsustainable intensification and associated nitrous oxide emissions. The purpose is not to penalise but to incentivise more sustainable behaviour. How this is communicated is vital: “we are not trying to penalise you, but to make sustainable behaviour more profitable (like water efficiency, nitrogen efficiency, landuse shifts where appropriate, boiler fuel shifts from coal to waste wood) . 3. Inequality - asset taxes are needed I don’t believe poverty can ever be eradicated by income transfers alone. Wealth and assets increase as and of themselves and currently are not touched by the tax system. The very wealthy do not necessarily have high incomes but have access to very high living standards and sources of investment to increase their wealth even further. They have the security of knowing that if a disaster befalls - eg health costs, or major repairs to home or replacement of car, they can sell assets to pay for that while the poor are exposed to high risk in these areas. Some shift of tax from incomes (at the base of the tax scale, not the margin) to levy wealth or assets is essential to address inequality. 4. Capital gains A capital gains tax is a step towards taxing assets, but not a strong step. Skipping that and going directly to an asset tax or land tax (with appropriate safeguards) is in my view preferable. But a capital gains tax would be better than nothing. 5. “The family home and the land it stands on” \[1\] \[1\] 2 Exempting the family home and its plot of land from any form of wealth tax could be hugely distortionary of house prices and investment incentives, in a similar way to the lack of a capital gains tax. It makes sense to exempt that part of the value of the family home that is required to provide a place to live. But exempting unlimited value will drive investment out of productive enterprises and into grandiose real estate which is the opposite of what is needed. Bearing in mind that only equity is taxed, exempting the average house value or a bit more will leave most people unaffected but capture the value of those who choose to store their wealth in ostentatious housing. It will reduce prices at the top end of the market and free up some capital for productive investments. While this (and other useful changes) appear to be ruled out by your terms of reference, strong mention could still be made of the desirability of doing this in a future term, and a case built for it. 6. GST I strongly oppose introducing exemptions from GST to combat poverty, as many have advocated. The one big advantage of GST is its simplicity and lack of exemptions (apart from financial services which helps some build serious wealth). Exemptions create unintended loopholes and administrative complexity. Retailers may well not pass on the reductions anyway. 7. Trusts I am not up to date with Trust tax law but my understanding is that they still enable people of high incomes to shelter behind them and pay a lower rate of tax than they would if that income had accrued to them personally. A revision of trust law is needed to institute a “look through” rule where the tax rate of the ultimate beneficiary is used to tax trust assets. An exception may be needed where the trust is for the long term care of people with disabilities. 8. A Tobin tax I have supported for many years the so-called Tobin tax where financial transfers between countries are taxed at a very low level to support international development and environmental work. this cannot be implemented by any country alone, but there is a group of countries who already support it and we should join them. the arguments i favour are well set out elsewhere. I also support international collaboration to ensure transnational corporations pay appropriate tax in al countries where they operate, as advocated in submission to this enquiry by Oxfam. Thank you for the opportunities to make these brief comments and I’m sorry I have not been able to go deeper into examples. Best wishes for your work. Jeanette Fitzsimons

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax First name: Judy Last name: McAnultyc Position: Administrator ☒ I am aware that my submission will be released on this website, with my email address withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply ☒ I would like to speak to this submission if the opportunity arises We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to be addressed • Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been • New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. • Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). • People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following: • Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% • Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) • Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. \[1\] \[1\] • It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the fairest as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Stop letting multinational overseas companies exploit New Zealanders with the downstream outcome of weakening our whole society. Everyone pays in a myriad of ways for New Zealand’s high alcohol consumption and no benefits are accrued.

Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley John Walley By email submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 April 2018 To Tax Working Group The Past The NZ economy lacks balance, since financial liberalisation in 1980 asset prices have increase far more than earnings. NZ has become a balance sheet economy; policy settings have generally encouraged speculation on assets as opposed to investment in productive activity. The economy should not be thought of as a machine following strict rules with highly predictable outcomes. The economy is more like a garden, where things emerge based on the ongoing interactions between the components of the system. Stuff grows or fails in part due to the system settings and given the option people chase the best post tax returns. If we observe undesirable outcomes in the economy, runaway asset prices relative to earnings for example, we either address the policy bias, or face the fact things are unlikely to change. There are biases in any given set of policies. The policy aim should not be zero bias, but the set of economic outcomes we want to see. If asset prices outstrip increases in incomes, then what can be done to attenuate one and encourage the other. While some gains are taxed and other are not those parts of the system that can chose to bias payoffs to assets and away from earnings will do so. The outcomes of extant bias are clear to see throughout our economy. Taking the example of the dairy farming model, it has regressed to the point where earnings largely cover living expenses and debt servicing. Profits are sublimated to capital gain. In fact, this is a self-reinforcing dependency, debt servicing costs balanced by the ability of the farm operational free cash flow to meet those costs essentially set asset price movements. Such a model, given financial deregulation, encourages debt expansion and focus on asset growth not income maximisation. The asset rich, cash poor, farming sector is a proverb. Why is this? In terms of the garden analogy tax free capital gains push the system to inflate asset values, limited by the ability to debt service. Not every dairy farm in the system will operate in this way but in general the trend 1 is clear, low interest rates turbo charge this tendency. In the same way, effective macroprudential controls 2 that existed prior to financial deregulation restrained debt growth on housing by directly linking debt to incomes, debt and income were connected by the lending practices based on income of the borrower. Without broader 1 https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/5787208/dairynz-economic-survey-2015-16.pdf 2 Price (interest rates) are insufficient, debt to income and loan to value limits are required. \[1\] Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley restraints the cost of borrowing is not sufficient to restrain asset prices, particularly when interest rates are low. Add in other system features that restrict new housing development, or any other sort of supply restriction, over the long run and the system settings generate a perfect storm of sustained asset price inflation. So we have a system biased to inflating asset values where it can, with a high level debt to income (heavy balance sheet) debt servicing can blunt tax on earnings and pushes more value towards tax free asset value growth. On the other hand, what happens with low asset business, those that can generate millions of sales with assets of a few hundred thousand. For them the picture is very different, they generate profit and that it overloaded with the prevailing tax burden. No easy write offs here, business value is set by earnings not asset inflation, in fact borrowing is quite hard for such business as lenders can make “safe” returns lending to the asset rich sector, not banking “risky” cash flows. The structural problem here is that most of the new economy, tends to come with light balance sheets. As earnings carry too much of the tax burden, our economy is nudged away from activity; less activity leads to lower employment and a broad erosion of productivity. International financing of inflating asset prices brings upward pressure on the New Zealand dollar, as does the general policy stance to defend asset prices at all cost. God forbid that real estate prices will fall. One way or another a secondary impact on the traded economy, which is far worse for those businesses where revenues are many times asset value (debt). The impact on exporters is clear: lower returns. The impact is ameliorated if you are operating a heavy balance sheet export business; you tend to care more about interest rates than you do exchange rates. The converse is true of light balance sheet, export dependent businesses, where trading returns not capital gains matter most. The tax take required to pay for any sent of government polices is the starting point, ignoring the balance of policy from one government to the next. How the taxation policy spreads that burden is critical component in how the economy develops. The bias to debt and heavy balance sheets, supports such activity, at the same time those settings push back on business that must rely on healthy income statements. Value develops quickly in light balance sheet businesses, most must rely on their ability to earn a living, many doing so from exports very early on in their growth, facing the headwinds of an overvalued currency and a disproportionate tax burden. Only very few can convince the markets that their future earnings will justify huge asset values today, despite income statement losses 3 . The outcome is predictable, over the past thirty or so years we have seen the simplification 4 of the New Zealand economy and a contraction in our earnings from intellectual property based elaborately transformed goods 5 . This tends to be self-reinforcing trend, it is hard for a simple economy to make complex things as complex things tend to rely on a related collection of expertise to give them life. 3 Uber and Xero for example. 4 http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/ 5 http://www.johnwalley.co.nz/271-thirty\_years\_of\_manufacturing\_.aspx Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley Take the tax bias, add an overvalued currency to a small, isolated local market and the set of biases against value creating economy becomes almost insurmountable. The garden does not grow what the garden rules do not favour. The Future The world is changing quickly. The changing nature of work and more broadly economic activity is different this time round 6 . The industrial revolution replaced human power with machine power. There remained sufficient labour demand for people employed in for thinking and control of that machine power. Once machines supplant cognitive capabilities of people, what is left? The need for some creative talent but how much of that will be needed? Will it be sufficient, I would say not. Read the full thread on the GM v Google link 7 . Add in the impact of climate 8 change, and the world economy will be challenged. For New Zealand the challenge is amplified as the laboratory 9 not the farm becomes the food producer; challenging all resource-based economies. Clean meat and dairy will be a hard act to counter. These things will happen in the next decade or so – best be as ready as we can be. Please, don’t kick the can down the road again, grasp the nettle, you can help fix the tax bias threatening the future of the New Zealand economy. It is not going to be easy, there is always great pressure from vested interests chanting “there is no alternative”.. The current winners will be threatened by the change, but it must be done. Our national business model is under threat from: climate change, international light balance sheet enterprise, cheaper, healthier lab grown clean meat 10 and dairy products. What we have now is not sustainable. Do what you can to, set the vision for the future, show the changes needed over time so we see an evenly balanced tax burden across a better functioning economy. Capital gains and income are spent in the same economy, the tax burden should be the same. We can all hope it happens this time round, the longer we wait the harder it will be. 6 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731710-300-the-inequality-delusion-why-weve-got-the-wealth-gap- all-wrong/ 7 http://www.grisanik.com/blog/who-did-better--gm-or-google-/ 8 https://www.westpac.co.nz/assets/Sustainability/Westpac-NZ-Climate-Change-Impact-Report.pdf 9 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331180-400-tomorrows-menu-termites-grass-and-synthetic-milk/ 10 https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/23/bill-gates-and-richard-branson-bet-on-lab-grown-meat-startup.html https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/clean-meat-lab-grown-available-restaurants-2018-global-warming- greenhouse-emissions-a8236676.html Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley Questions for Submitters • Future Environment Technology change comes with its own threats and opportunities, healthier, cheaper and lower carbon footprint 11 lab grown meat 12 , milk, vegetable substitutes will undercut traditional food production and resource-based economies. Digital technology undercuts service provision, job quantity and job location. Given that background any distortions in the tax system that weight towards capital intensive activity and away from income generating activity accelerate the trend to job loss and attenuated job creation. If the tax base is earnt income and consumption, both are threatened by these trends. A fit for purpose tax system should not pick winners in any asset class. Figure 12 in the report tells its own story; small wonder housing / land has seen runaway inflation given the tax advantages and the essentially unrestrained availability of credit. Advantaging one asset class, impoverishes the others. Unfortunately, the others tend to earn income from activity, create jobs and increase the velocity of money in the economy. There are implications for currency stability, greater emphasis on the real economy, deemphasising capital speculation would lead to lower foreign borrowing taking pressure off currency and interest rates. If the economy is to earn more from export activity (as opposed to local untaxed capital gains) currency stability becomes a key enabler for investment decisions in export businesses, jobs, and earnings. A financial transactions tax would put some sand in the gears of speculation around currency, better matching the speed of the financial system with the real economy. The NZ$ trades more in a single day that the annual total on bilateral trade in goods. Who does that serve? The real economy should not be hostage to finance, even low rates 0.25% are said to be effective in this regard 13 Finally the global technology giants should be taxed on a revenue basis not in country income net of costs 14 debt loading of local subsidiaries can eliminate any net income. Revenue is easily measure and appropriate tax rate of around 10% of revenue 15 . • Purposes and Principles of a good tax system Even handed treatment of all asset classes, be as broad as possible (yes include the family home and / or the land under it) all gains in the economy should all share the tax burden. 11 https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23631463-800-grassfed-beef-is-bad-for-the-planet-and-causes- climate-change/ 12 https://thespinoff.co.nz/business/24-10-2017/synthetic-meats-are-on-their-way-and-our-farmers-are-going-to- be-left-behind/ 13 https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/why-we-need-a-financial-transaction-tax/ 14 https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/corporate-tax-and-the-digital-economy-position-paper 15 https://www.ft.com/content/9bd2c65a-17fb-11e8-9e9c-25c814761640 Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley Anything less means those gains not so exempt carry a disproportionate tax load. Get away from the idea that taxation is theft, and recognise taxation is the price we pay for the public goods we use or have the potential to access. • Current New Zealand tax system The NZ tax system could be boarder and consequently lower for those paying tax at the moment, the more even handed the lower the burden carried by each contributor. Fairness is a major contributor to compliance; the converse also applies. Behavioural change targeted taxation has its attractions, but probably stirs up too much controversy, smoking – drinking – drugs – obesity (sugar) – risky activities, where to draw the line. Best to keep it simple and put real effort into telling the tax story and fairness driving tax compliance. Simple, low and no exceptions, free people make their own decisions, that would include the removal of all incentives for any particular activity, regardless of how worthy it might seem. The comparison of New Zealand GST with value added taxes elsewhere is a great example of effectiveness flowing from simplicity. • Results of the current tax system Far from supporting the real sector our current tax setting encourages speculation, places pressures on the exchange rate that combine to suppress the real sector. The problems do not all flow from the tax setting but those settings in combination with other macroeconomic policies damage the real sector. The tax advantages of land and buildings coupled with the lack or macroprudential restrains on borrowing, principally debt to income limits, has seen asset value inflate at a many time the growth in incomes. Limited supply of real estate and an essentially unrestricted (absence of prudential control) supply of borrowing the rest is predictable. The interaction of the tax system and other macroeconomic settings 16 are the core problem. The Dairy NZ Report below shows an average dairy farm ten-year growth in assets from $4.6m to $7.5m paying around income tax $35k a year through that decade. Behaviour follows the rules; value is capitalised, and income minimised. This builds the wrong focus in the investment. A similar analysis could be written for rental housing, easy to fund (heavy balance sheet) negative gearing costs are deductible against other income and capital tax on realisation can be largely avoided. 16 https://www.dairynz.co.nz/media/5787208/dairynz-economic-survey-2015-16.pdf Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley What we have is a balance sheet focused economy, income is avoided, income statement losses embraced, and capital is allocated inefficiently. Good for some but not a good outcome for the broad economy. Overdoing farming or tourism erodes natural capital, with marginal business based in the natural world the desire to externalise costs is strong – not sure where the “polluter pays” discussion fits in a tax discussion but business should bear the full cost of “emissions” to properly align incentive. Performance suggests that is not the case at the moment. Capital gains on business sales are more complex, growth in value generally flows from the income statement and investment in people and capital, is this different from real estate based gains – farms and houses. A broad comparison of two types of business over a decade: Asset Value 2008 2018 Farm $4.5m $7.5m Software $50k $200k Revenue Farm $1m\` $1m Software $0.5m $4.5m Staff Farm 2 2 Software 2 16 Tax Paid Farm 35k $35k Software $35k $300k Disposal Value Farm $4.5m $7.5m (asset backing) Software $1m $7.5m (EBIT multiplier) How would capital gains tax be calculate on disposal for these businesses? Would the Software business pay more CGT than the Farm? The Farm has value from asset price inflation (real estate / land value issue) there other from real increased value of the business. The software company has paid significant tax over the decade the Farm has paid less tax than the people employed in the business. Should they be treated in the same way? Particularly when we need more businesses like software and farming is limited by environmental constraints and is under threat from laboratory innovation.. • Thinking Outside the System As mentioned above a financial transaction tax and a no exceptions tax on capital gains broadens the tax base so all carry the lowest tax burden possible given any set of government spending objectives. Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley • Specific Challenges The tax system has exacerbated housing affordability, aided by the broken connection between borrowing and income that came with the financial deregulation on the 1980s. There are significant incentives to invest in a potential tax-free gain and deduct rental losses from other income. Owner occupied housing has a similar attraction, the wealth effect form property value escalation enabling borrowings to sustain lifestyles paid for one day by tax free capital gain. That also comes with a worry about house prices falling and the attendant political pressure. There is the political investment in the merits of the status quo, current winners will know their losses far better than the potential winners will know their gains. The political third rail of capital gains tax is clear, but change is vital to lower the tax burden on the real sector and return balance to our economy. o A capital gains tax on realisation as part of income, tax all capital gains including the family home. o Capital gains tax should not be in addition to existing taxes, existing taxes should be sublimated into a straightforward CGT system. o Tax should be paid once, if non-residents are taxed in their own country only a balancing local payment if the foreign rate is lower. o Capital losses should be ringfenced, applied against capital gains. o Roll over relief should apply. o Realisation triggers capital taxation. o Gifting is realisation so should trigger capital tax. Winnings should be subject to income tax. o Capital tax should be at the taxpayer’s marginal rate. o No allowance for Inflation should be applied. o For simplicity a threshold should be used say the national mean house price? o The cleaner and simpler the CGT system the cleaner and simpler the administration. o Changes should be introduced with sufficient lead-time to enable tax payers to work with the changes. o Capital tax should be based on valuation at date of introduction. o Trusts should be inside the CGT net. o In some way CGT should target asset price inflation (real estate) not value increases from real revenue growth. With a broad and effective capital gains tax, the that land taxes could be used to target asset price inflation at a higher rate that real capital gains. Environmental taxation: polluter pays, all gases all emitters carbon taxes seem increasing necessary, however focus on one thing at once and get the CGT done before these other matters. Slightly longer term the technical changes to food production will have a major impact on land based production and carbon emission. If there is a desire to support small companies, on what basis is small? Tax paid, asset employed, revenue. Don’t supporting heavy balance sheet businesses. Back to the dairy farm example ~$7.5m in assets driving ~$1m is sales paying ~$35k in tax employing ~2.5 people, is that a small Submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 John Walley business? Software business ~$300k in assets driving ~$4.5m paying 300k employing 16 people, is that a small business? The complications that come with GST exemptions should be avoided: always the same principles: low, broad and capital tax on asset price inflation, not value increases.

Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Taxing times Tax and taxation are as old as civilization From ancient manuscripts and books such as the Bible we learn of rulers and governments levying citizens to maintain power, defend against enemies, foreign and home grown, and to fund the building of infrastructure and monuments, useful and otherwise, that we now take for granted. There has always been discussion, dissention, protest and sometimes revolution over the imposition of taxes. The Boston Tea Party that began as a protest against ‘taxation without representation’ was to become the trigger that set off the American Revolution. Taxation can be used to promote social change, by increasing the price of goods deemed to be undesirable or of a “luxury” type, thereby guiding spending and investment into areas deemed to be more socially or economically desirable. This can be fraught with difficulty, however, as many examples, old and new show. The classic story beloved by generations of children of “The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh” was based on the exploits of smugglers “providing ‘brandy for the Vicar, baccy for the clerk’ at cut prices by dodging the King’s Revenue Men. In the same way in modern New Zealand, robberies to obtain alcohol and cigarettes, both subject to steeply rising taxes, show that such a policy can lead to an even greater evil than the one supposedly being cured. Economists pontificate about the “distortions to the market” caused by this or that tax, as though a perfect, untaxed market is some sort of holy grail, instead of being rightly dismissed as a fantastic pipe dream. Income tax, our most common form of raising revenue over more than 2 centuries, taxes work, a highly desirable activity. It was originally a temporary measure introduced by William Pitt the Younger in England to finance the Napoleonic Wars and is complex and expensive to collect, with high compliance costs for taxpayers. In its current form it has no place in a modern economy. 2 So in the 21 st century who or what should we tax, how, and how much should different people pay? Should it depend on age, wealth, income, occupation, star sign or random chance? Reason would suggest that we should be favouring taxes that efficiently promote desirable activity, and discourage anti-social or otherwise undesirable activities that impose avoidable costs on society either in monetary terms e.g. more spending on health, or that curtail freedoms such as levies and charges on access to information, and these policies can be at odds with each other depending on the definitions of cost and freedom. In New Zealand we currently tax personal income, transfers of goods and services (GST) which is a value-added tax, i.e. it is only levied on the increase (or rebated on the decrease of each transaction and while NZ has one of the most broadly based such taxes in the OECD, there are large sections of economic activity that are exempt, such as financial fees and charges, including interest. Initially levied at 10% (ten cents in the dollar) it has since been raised to 12.5 % and is currently at 15% and is seen as having the benefit of encouraging saving by adding costs to spending. While it is levied at a flat rate it is in its effect a regressive tax, with poorer people who must spend a higher proportion of their income each week paying proportionately more of their income in a tax that puts up the cost of the essentials of living at the same rate as luxury goods which are discretionary for those with surplus income. We also tax company profits, with a range of exceptions and a complex set of rules around expenses, fringe benefits and Loss Attributing Companies as well as other ‘fine print’ provisions. No wonder the IRD has some 2000 forms on its website! There are also a raft of special levies, such as fuel tax, alcohol and gaming taxes and duties etc., etc. each one with its compliance costs and peculiarities. These complexities ensure that Taxation advisers and lawyers are busy people. They are also protected people. If their advice is wrong, the liability rests with the taxpayer, not the adviser. Compare this to the requirements placed on a Real Estate Agent for example, who is deemed to be culpable and liable to heavy sanctions if they pass on incorrect information to a prospective purchaser, even if the client has deliberately lied to and misled them. 3 Then there are other areas that escape the net. Capital Gains (the increase in value of an asset) are only taxed in some circumstances and the definitions and grey areas have tax lawyers laughing all the way to the bank. Then there is the REAL BIGGIE! Total transactions through banks, stock exchanges futures markets, etc. amount to at least Sixty ( yes, 60) times the trade in goods and services that form the basis of Gross Domestic Product or GDP as it’s commonly known. None of this purely financial activity attracts tax unless declared as profit. Indeed much of it is aimed at avoiding tax by obscure and complex shuffling of money. A large part of GDP is subject to GST at 15%, and while dealing in Millions of dollars by computer on the financial markets is seen by some as necessary and beneficial to the economy, it is not paying a cent. When I was 16 (not yesterday) I watched a ship being loaded with frozen lamb carcasses at the Port of Timaru. In the days before containerisation each carcass was unloaded by hand from a rail wagon placed on a greased wooden chute and pushed down the chute onto a sling placed on the wharf, to be hoisted into the hold and stacked. I the length of the 5 metre chute there were 4 wharfies each giving the lamb a gentle push to speed it on its short downhill journey. Given the nature and incline of the chute one would have been ample. This sort of ‘featherbedding’ cost the producers money and in the end cost the wharfies the sympathy and support of their fellow workers when technology and containers became the new normal. The point of this story is that, if we need to shift each dollar 60 times to generate $1 worth of GDP then the financial markets are worse than those wharf workers by far. It is inefficiency writ large, and tax free into the bargain. There is no penalty, and indeed current tax law and mechanisms encourage such behaviour. It is fair to assume that a good proportion of the 2008/9 income tax cuts which favoured those on higher incomes found their way into speculation in the property (Auckland housing) market or financial markets where returns could successfully avoid tax with little risk. 4 Let’s debate these questions: Are these such desirable activities that they should pay no tax? Is shifting large sums of money by computer doing anything to assist the health of our society or the environment of our planet? If not, should and can they be taxed? My conclusion is that not only can they be and should they be, but it would be beneficial for the markets themselves and the whole economy. A small levy of less than 1 cent in the dollar on every financial transfer would raise enough money to enable us to remove some of our more regressive taxes, such as GST, that have a disproportionate effect on the 80 plus per cent of us who live on less than the average wage. We could set the personal income tax threshold much higher at say $50,000 We could get rid of some or all of the compliance heavy company taxes, and let companies put that effort into the productive part of their business. All this can be done by using the existing Computer System, doing the Transfers to take a small levy on Every Financial Transaction just as the Banks do now on a daily basis with their Fees and chargers. No forms, no exemptions so no avoidance - LETS DO IT! N.B. This form of taxation was originally proposed by Nobel Prize winning economist James Tobin who wanted it as an international tax to fund the United Nations and “to throw sand in the gears of the markets”. All this in the days before markets were computerised and shifted vast sums at the speeds now achieved. 5 This tax is currently being seriously considered in Britain and Europe. The tax is low rate and flat in imposition, but progressive in application (he/she who moves the most money pays the most tax. The only unknown factor is the amount that would be raised given that the degree to which it will influence behaviour is untested. If initially levied at a very low rate of about 0.3% say as a potential replacement for GST, it could be phased in in a balanced way, and prove no more disruptive to the economy than the now widely accepted practice of the Reserve Bank of altering interest rates. In fact small variations of the Transfer Tax rate could be a useful alternative tool for controlling inflation, by removing excess purchasing power without pushing up mortgage costs and cost of working capital for businesses. Having a fiscal tool with a more direct impact than interest rates would be a better solution in the face of sudden major disruptions, but its use would need to be well controlled to avoid over-corrections and excess volatility. Future Proofing. In our rapidly changing world driven by technology and the global markets with which we now interact, traditional taxes will become harder to levy comprehensively. The current moves to try to impose GST on small private imports are a case in point. How much simpler, and fairer to simply take a fraction of a cent in the dollar on the credit card transaction associated with the deal and have the onshore trader paying exactly the same. Similarly with the rise of cyber payment methods such as “bit coin” and others the payment can be the same percentage. In Conclusion: It’s simple, cheap to operate, hard to avoid, not distortionary to the economy. Can we possibly fund the requirements of a modern civilization for better infrastructure, health care and environmental improvement in a fairer way? I don’t believe we can – let someone prove me wrong if they can.

For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Introduction I have been interested in the area of tax policy and welfare for some years, and particularly during the previous few election periods. My background is previously as an actuarial analyst working for Tower Insurance, and AMP. More recently I have been a stay at home mother and land lord. I have been involved in volunteer work including budget advising, school committee fund raising, and science lab work help at the local school. I am in my early 50s but managed to accumulate enough wealth to retire along with my husband in my early forties due to hard work and studying, saving and investing in a few rental properties. I am at the tail end of the despised baby boomer generation or maybe I am the first of the generation X? I read the Tax working Group paper with interest and at first thought it would be a waste of time making a submission. But I find myself drawn into reading news reports on Stuff, and making comments on articles. I have a range of experiences with my finance/insurance and property background but also have seen the plight of budget clients and tenants. My view is you can’t separate tax issues and the welfare system as they are totally entwined. I think what is needed is to look at both together and come up with a “Theory of Everything”. However, the scope of this working group is to look at tax alone so I have chosen to comment on just a few areas of tax that particularly interest or affect me, however there is a bit of a cross over into welfare. I also have explained a few new ideas/concepts that I have that are a bit different from the usual list of taxes but haven’t commented on every issue as I am sure there will hundreds of people all making the same points on some issues. I am happy to discuss these ideas further or put more time into developing them. I believe the tax system should be: • Simple to understand • Not create silly behaviour trying to avoid it • Not create unintended consequences • Cheap and simple to administer • Encourage work ethic, saving, self sufficiency • Encourage people to be proud or happy to contribute to society • Be perceived to be fair • Be efficient; only given to those in need. Questions we need to ask are: • Do we need to collect more tax, or just redistribute it differently? • Are there other ways of achieving the goals of society without changing tax structures given the limited ability to change much in the short term due to the government’s election promises? • Are there alternatives to taxing money? 2 Summary of Main points Superannuation • Changing demographics mean the number of elderly is increasing relative to the number of workers.... but is it as bad as it seems? • Many retirees have relatively high income, assets or both so do not “need” superannuation from age 65 to live in comfort, but solutions such as a surcharge, decrease in superannuation amounts or raising of age of entitlement are all politically fraught. I suggest another alternative which is not a tax and will also help offset the rising health care costs of this group. Property (from the point of view of a landlord) • Any tax increase on rental properties will cause rental property shortages, rent rises and affect the most vulnerable tenants. • Does the government want private landlords in the market? • Has property really got a tax advantage? • Ideas on property solutions without increasing/changing taxes Thoughts on Public Awareness and Perception • Can the media be used to alter behaviours without changes to the tax rules and rates? Culture Tax exemption - An idea from Ireland • Could this be used in parts of NZ, in particular for Maori culture? Tax Base and Inequality • Discussion on different types of wealth including land. • Time is a type of wealth that we all have in equal amounts. Could time be taxed? Other points on Welfare and inequality • There is a tax inequality between single and childless people and solo parents. This distorts behaviours and is leading to poverty. 3 Thoughts on the future environment Sometimes we get trapped into a certain way of thinking. People hear “facts” in the media and repeat them and then they become accepted as the truth. It can be helpful to say is that really right? The aging population Fact 1: The baby boomers are a huge bulge of people all coming though the system en mass - the image is a bit like large animal passing through a boa constrictor! In reality the actual number of people born over those years is roughly the same per year as the number born each year now. The birth rate has fallen, but that has been offset by a larger population leading to roughly the same number of births so there is no big bulge. Actually as the diagram shows below the pyramid is being replaced with a rectangle. Fact 2: The huge numbers of elderly people entering retirement will put a strain on the system as there will not be enough younger people working to support them. But another way to look at this is to look at it as a workforce/labour issue rather than just an age issue. Keeping all other factors equal (e.g. ignoring the effects of technology etc) the number of jobs requiring workers shouldn’t change hugely just because the work force is aging. Therefore as long as someone is being paid to do those jobs the amount of income tax coming in shouldn’t drop. Some areas of employment will increase as a % (age care) and others may decrease proportionally (education, child welfare). Currently if you lose your job after the age of 45-50 it can be difficult to find another. I think to some extent what will have to happen is that employers will begin to hire more older staff instead of only considering <45 year olds. People are living longer and are more youthful and computer literate at age 65 than in previous generations. They are also not as happy to take a large drop in income and standard of living in retirement. Skilled workers will be sought after and manual jobs may be automated and less available. And with more flexible working arrangements and business opening 24/7 part time work is becoming more common. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 4 I see the changing demographics to be a positive thing for mature workers’ job security in skilled jobs that do not require physical labour. (http://www.ey.com/nz/en/services/people- advisory-services/ey-new-zealand-people-watch-february-2017-the-changing-demographics- of-our-workforce-opportunities-for-business) Low skilled, and manual workers may not want to or be able to work past retirement so that may lead to a shortage of workers in this area but this will be offset somewhat by the technological changes reducing the numbers of these workers required. (Automation of jobs, skilled and unskilled will reduce the jobs available in these areas.) Once retired from work income decreases, but consumption continues from savings and superannuation. Income tax decreases but GST continues so some tax is still received from this group. Is the future as bad as it looks? Although the ratio of elderly to younger age groups will increase in future I wonder if it isn’t as bad as the above diagram portrays it to be. In 1901 there would have been many fewer women working so much of the right hand side of that pyramid would have also been supported by the workers as well as many more under 15 year olds. In 2001 if the graph showed the workers supporting the dependents you might find that because the under 20 year old category is smaller and many more women work, the ratio of workers to non workers isn’t very different. The workforce adjusted to carry out the jobs. The same will happen in future. The larger problem is the high cost of superannuation payments and age care (health and accommodation). But the cost of under 20 year olds is not cheap either and the relative size of this group has decreased so that might offset the increased costs of the older group to some extent. I see the main issues relating to the aging workforce to be • Ensuring there are enough workers to fill vacated jobs or technologies to replace workers so the amount of income tax being paid does not decrease. • Up skilling, retraining the older work force so those who wish to can carry on working either full time or part time. • Ageism in the workforce. • The growing cost of medical/age care • The growing cost of superannuation payments Figure 10 from the working paper suggests that of the amount spent on transfers, almost 6% was superannuation payments to households in the top income decile. If this is true 6% of the total $23,598b spent on welfare in 2015 is $1.4b. An article from 2014 based on an official information request said 26,000 individuals with income $70,000 or more claimed superannuation, or around $0.57b out of the $10.2b (5.6%) spent on superannuation that year. 5 Whatever the exact figure is it seems to be a large amount of money paid to people who have already have more than enough to live on. They are likely also to have high net worth. At the age of 65 they have possibly just paid off their mortgage, no longer have dependent children, are allowed to access their Kiwisaver funds, then unless they retire from a paid job, they will start receiving an extra $300-$400 per week. If you add to that the people in the 8 th and 9 th decile this amounts to several $billion pa going to people who could live comfortably without it, but how do you wrestle this money off the people in this group? It would be such an unpopular policy that no political party has been able to suggest it without losing voters, and is unlikely to be possible in future without the support of the opposition parties. A superannuation surcharge (means testing) has been tried failed due to the apparent unfairness of penalising people with income testing for what has in the past at least has been seen as an entitlement rather than a benefit. Disadvantages of surcharges are • They have the effect of influencing the decision on how much to save for retirement. • If the surcharge only considers income it doesn’t necessarily catch high net worth/low income individuals. • Assets can be arranged to reduce income and increase capital gain. The two other possibilities often raised are raising the retirement age or reducing the amount of the pension. These are also unpopular (although over 67 year olds may be happy to raise the age of entitlement). A novel Superannuation Solution One solution to this would be a hybrid of means testing and carrying on with the current system as follows: • Superannuation payments would continue unchanged except where income (either by household or individual) is in the top deciles. In this case the superannuation payments would be paid into a personal fund/account similar to KiwiSaver. Call it KiwiRetire for now. • This personal KiwiRetire account could not be accessed for day to day spending, but would be used for paying for medical insurance premiums (unless the person opts out of that benefit), then eventually to pay for rest home fees or home care services once required i.e. only the necessary costs of old age. • The threshold could be either set for individual or jointly by household • As well as the income threshold there would also preferably be a wealth threshold to catch high wealth, low income individuals e.g. rental property owners (see below). • If income from other sources and wealth drops back below a certain level the pension payment to the individual would resume. For people with very high net worth this is unlikely to occur. • On death the individual’s balance would be paid into the NZ Superannuation Fund. If jointly owned it would be paid to their spouse/partner’s KiwiRetire account, then to the NZ Superannuation Fund on their death. • A lump sum Funeral grant could be paid out of it. • A lump sum for hard ship may be paid from it by application 6 Overall there would be no less paid out in superannuation payments initially, but it would only ultimately be spent on services that would already be partially paid for out of the health and welfare budgets if the individual runs out of assets and income. Over time thresholds could be slowly adjusted if necessary to include people in deciles 8 then 7 (or not adjusted for inflation) to include larger numbers of households. Once the current Kiwi Saver product reaches equilibrium (as people saving since entering the workforce in their 20s retire) more people may be over the wealth and income thresholds when they reach age 65 so more superannuation payments will be diverted into later age retirement savings via KiwiRetire. The KiwiSaver platform could be used for this new product but with different rules around it, such as the rules on withdrawals. The range of funds could be limited to balanced- conservative as the majority of the money would be required within 5-15 years Advantages to the individual compared with a surcharge or raising of entitlement age: • The money isn’t “lost” to them if they have saved too much so it doesn’t have the disincentive to save that a surcharge would. • Full medical cover under private insurance, dental . Pre-existing conditions might be covered if government can get a bulk deal. • Rest home care payments and home care services (e.g. cleaner, meals on wheels etc) use this money before eating into personal wealth. • Elderly person might be more inclined to take advantage of health services and home help if they don’t have to pay for it out of their own wealth so they may remain healthier. • Builds up funeral grant • Nest egg for hardship if required. • The individual is less likely to feel they are being penalised for being successful than if a surcharge similar to the one in the 1980s is applied. If this is seen as a type of surcharge it is at least seen to be used to pay for their own expenses. • The individual feels as though they have some control over the money if they want to e.g. which level of medical insurance they want, which KiwiSaver provider, which funds to invest in. • However those already over 67 may prefer raising the age of entitlement instead. Advantage to taxpayer • Superannuation payments would only be used for essentials, not as “pocket money” for the wealthy. This could help alleviate some of the perceived intergenerational unfairness of the current system. • Private medical insurance would reduce public health costs as it takes some elderly people out of the public health system who may not normally have private health insurance. • Some money recouped from superannuation payments that might otherwise be spent or given away by super annuitants will be diverted to prefund the future ballooning rest home care. (If elderly people anticipate having to move to rest home currently there is an incentive to spend up large or to give away money if the government will get it anyway because of the assets threshold). • On death the remaining balance goes to the NZ Superannuation fund. 7 • As this is not a “tax” (just a compulsory savings scheme) it could be brought in immediately without breaking election promises (except perhaps for the payment of the balance to the NZ Superannuation Scheme on death which might be considered a death duty). • This isn’t a wealth tax or a capital gains tax but it does have the advantage of clawing back around $300-400pw from the same people who might otherwise be subject to a capital gains tax or wealth tax. It would postpone the spending until when they reached say 80-90 years old and then only be used if required, so it would pre- fund some future age care expenses. • The NZ Superannuation fund would have some money diverted to it without NZ having to borrow to fund it. It would also not need to build up as much for the future if people had their own personal KiwiRetire funds. Extension for wealth testing: If a wealth test was included as well as an income test it would catch low income, high net worth people (e.g. rental property investors). Also, as future KiwiSaver balances become larger, it will discourage people from trying to find low income, high capital gain investments for their lump sum at retirement to keep their income below the thresholds. E.g. superannuation payments would be diverted to KiwiRetire if: • Net wealth greater than say $400k (single)/$600k (couple) excluding the family home. This could give an extra $20k/$30k income @ 5% return on top of the pension before the pension is diverted to Kiwi retire. (Although that might encourage people to stay in a home that is too large for them) or • Net wealth greater than say $800k (single)/$1m (couple) including the family home. (This would be preferred to encourage downsizing to free up larger houses and extra income/cash) • If you assume their capital was to be used up as well over 20 years the limits would be smaller, say $265k (single), $400k (couple) excluding family home or say $665k (single), $800k (couple) including family home • Limits might differ by city e.g. Auckland might allow more for the family home. • Limits should be set to allow a higher standard of retirement than on the pension so it is not seen to penalise people who have saved and built up wealth Private health insurance: • One example is Southern Cross Standard wellbeing one, with Keeping Well added benefit costs approximately $65 increasing to $82 per week from age 65 to 85 – • Government may be able to get bulk deal cheaper, particularly if everyone in this group is included • Pre-existing conditions may be allowed with no underwriting if it was compulsory and it covered a large group Other points: • The very wealthy who live well into their 80s and 90s already pay for their own age care because they have enough wealth that they do not reach the current threshold. This won’t affect them at all apart from delaying the availability of their 8 superannuation until they need it for old age care. This is not a tax to take more money off the wealthy, it just ensures that more people pay their own old age costs if they are able to instead of overspending on luxuries in their early retirement and relying on the taxpayer to fund their expensive later age care. • Some wealth owned by the elderly will be held in trusts. Income they receive will be caught by this but wealth won’t be necessarily. If the family home or the value of the home they live in if it is in trust is included in the wealth test this should still pick up these people unless they move to cheaper accommodation. 9 Thoughts on Property and Housing affordability The reason I invest in property is because I want an investment where income and capital are inflation linked. I remember the stock market crash in the 80s so have never really trusted shares although I do have some of those too. When buying a rental property I look at the Net Present Value of the future expected cash flow from the property, including the sale price, and that determines the maximum price I am prepared to pay for it. If the costs of owning the property are increased including compliance costs and taxes I would raise rents over time to cover the extra costs. If over time I am consistently unable to increase rents to give me a reasonable rate of return including expected capital gain I would probably sell my properties. I think this is what any rational owner would do. So my view on any tax changes are as a landlord: Capital gains tax: • Decreases return so reduces the amount I am prepared to pay for a rental, and I will increase rents on my current rentals as the market allows. • CGT gives owner occupiers a tax advantage over landlords so they will be prepared to pay more for the same property (they often do anyway as owner occupiers tend to form emotional attachment to a property rather than analysing the numbers). • Less property investors will lead to less rentals so there may be a rental shortage and rents will rise. • In effect landlords subsidise rental accommodation in NZ in anticipation of the capital gain they will receive. Any capital gains tax will mean this rent subsidy will decrease and tenants will have to pay more of the costs of owning the property. • To be fair to renters any capital gains tax should be applied to all property including owner occupied houses. Then to raise the same amount of tax the rate could be lower and it would not introduce a tax advantage to owner occupiers over renters. Land tax: • Has all the same side effects as capital gains tax with the added disadvantage that it will increase annual expenses for landlords unless it can be accrued and paid when property is sold. • Elderly landlords often keep rents below market rates as their expenses are low and they don’t want the hassle of a rent review but if expenses increase and they are cash flow poor they will have to increase rents or sell up. • To be fair to renters any land tax should be applied to all property including owner occupied houses. Then to raise the same amount of tax the rate could be lower and it would not introduce a tax advantage to owner occupiers over renters. Ring fencing: • This won’t affect me as I don’t offset rental losses against other income. 10 • For landlords that do offset rental losses against other income this will have the same short term effect as an increase in their income tax rate. Unless they have spare cash flow from their personal income they will have to put up rents immediately or sell up. • Maintenance and improvements will possibly be deferred. • In the long run rents will rise, mortgages will be paid off and past expenses will be able to be claimed against profits so although tax paid will be greater initially it will be offset against tax rebated later so it is only a timing issue unless property is sold before it is making a positive return. • Even if some investors do have enough cash flow from their personal income to subsidise rental properties, some won’t so overall it will lead to less property investors and less rentals so there may be a rental shortage and rents may rise. • In effect ring fencing allows landlords to subsidise the rents on their rental property. If this is removed the tenant will lose this subsidy. Summary Any tax increase on rental properties will cause rental property shortages, rent rises and affect the most vulnerable tenants who will never be in a position to own their home. Some better off renters may be able to buy their first home more cheaply as prices may decrease if many investors sell at once but generally the owner occupiers are the ones who set the market price as they are emotional buyers and don’t buy based on investment yields so prices may not drop. The increase of properties on the market will be offset somewhat by the ex-tenants who want to buy as they can’t find a rental. Does property have a tax advantage over other investments? Figure 21 from tax working party report suggests that property has a tax advantage. This is based on various assumptions and adding all the various taxes together to get an overall rate. I think that Figure 21 is disingenuous. It makes no sense to add the various types of taxes together and make broad assumptions. The only reason you would do that is to influence public opinion on capital gains tax or land tax by suggesting that property is under taxed compared with other asset classes. The various tax rates would be better represented as follows: Cash Shares Property Interest = nominal + inflation Tax rate = income tax rate Dividends = nominal + Inflation Tax rate = income tax rate Rent = nominal + inflation Tax rate = income tax rate Capital gain (CG) = none Tax rate = N/A CG = nominal + Inflation Tax rate = income tax rate (Based on intention) CG = nominal + Inflation Tax rate = income tax rate (Bright line test for rentals only else nil) Wealth tax = 0% Wealth tax = 0% Wealth tax = 0.35% (rates on rentals and owner occupied homes) If you compare tax on the assets in this way it appears property is taxed more highly. 11 Questions that need to be asked: • Does the government really want to provide all rental accommodation in NZ? • If so what is the cost and how do we the tax payers pay for it? • If not, what is behind the constant beating up of private landlords by the current government and media? • Older land lords will exit the market eventually as they need the cash and younger people may be discouraged from becoming landlords because of constant negative media reports. Who will provide private rental accommodation for people who don’t meet the requirements for state housing? Some ideas I have on housing are listed in Appendix1 with brief details. I would be interested in working on solutions in this area and sent some of these suggestions to Nick Smith a few years ago. These are not tax issues but as I said earlier I think tax and benefits systems, income and expenses need to be looked at together. Given the difficulty in increasing taxes politically in the next few years without breaking election promises I think some of these ideas could help solve some issues without increasing or changing taxes. 12 Thoughts on Public awareness and Perception These days with social media and alternative facts, perception and communications are in some ways more important than reality. Two “facts” I have already mentioned above that aren’t really true or at least could be argued a different way are that there is a huge bulge of baby boomers coming through the system, and that property investors are unfairly advantaged in the tax system. It dawned on me how important perception is in affecting reality when watching a cricket match a few years after the Christchurch earthquake. The cameras panned over the crowds then past the trees then as they pointed at the destroyed city, images of the planned new city were swapped in so to the audience in other parts of NZ and the world it appeared the city had been rebuilt. When we have visitors they still say “We thought Christchurch had been rebuilt”. CERA did a great job of altering public perception. I think there are also ways the media can be used to change public perception to make people make changes in behaviour without enforcing rules or increasing taxes. The most obvious is again the group of super annuitants who currently work and have a reasonable income, or who have a lot of assets so don’t really need to enrol for their super. To be honest many may already feel a little uncomfortable about signing up for super. Over time subtle marketing could reposition super as more of an unemployment benefit in people’s minds rather than a right. This may take a few years to have any effect and would need to be done in increments but eventually the message should be “I am happy to be supporting myself on my own income and assets and I won’t be signing up for the super even though I am entitled to as I’m not ready to retire and I would much rather the money went to paying for upgrading hospitals and paying nurses and teachers a fair wage.” Another group of people who are being paid money unnecessarily are people who have businesses and wealth but their income is low. Some kind of wealth test needs to be imposed here as well as the message that it is not ok to claim WFF payments if you don’t need it. Another way media could influence behaviour is by using it to highlight where/who tax comes from. In Norway the tax department releases the amount of tax paid by individuals so you can see what people pay. But if you look up someone they will receive an email to let them know so your neighbour will know if you are enquiring after them. Some think the poor may be made unhappy seeing how much the rich earn but they will also see how much tax they pay and in most cases they will discover they pay none themselves while the rich pay plenty. This should reduce the perception that somehow the rich aren’t paying their share of taxes. This would also have the added benefit of making people who work for “cashies” obvious to their friends and neighbours so they may be shamed into paying more .i.e. if you don’t pay much tax you probably shouldn’t be driving a flash car and living in an expensive suburb. Another possibility (which may or may not be feasible in practice) would be to allow people to specify on their tax returns where some of their tax money goes to make them feel more engaged in the system. Some will need to go to boring things of course that no one would choose but over and above this base amount they might want to choose the $X goes to local 13 (regional) health, or education, roads , reducing poverty etc. Some people won’t be interested of course, but for other people it would make them feel like they were contributing in a worthwhile way. This would really be a perception thing as money couldn’t physically be diverted according to these wishes (at least at first) but at least the government would get a good idea what people want tax to be spent on. Another option is for people to be able to pay a discretionary amount over and above their required tax bill and specify where that is spent. There are many wealthy socialists out there who vote in the hope that inequality will be reduced. Give them ways of putting their money into areas that are of interest to them and stop trying to make them feel guilty about being successful. For example a person’s tax bill might be $40,000 over the year, and they might choose to allocate their $1,000 refund to increasing the health budget for their local hospital or pay for carbon credits as a one off “budget bonus”. Perhaps the amount of the extra discretionary tax paid by an individual and the budget it was increasing could be made public initially, (a philanthropy list) then some time in the future the full amount of tax people are paying could be published once people got used to the idea. Another way media could also be useful is in changing the perception of the value of older workers. In future people may choose to work well past 65 and employers will have to hire more older workers as the ratio of older vs. younger people increases. Julie Anne Genter’s recent outbursts about old white males are concerning because in the future we will need to rely on all the experienced, reliable workers available to provide the work force to pay the income tax that is needed. Any ageism needs to be stomped out as quickly as racism and sexism as it is just as offensive, destructive and counter-productive. Idea from Ireland An interesting tax idea from Ireland is the Culture tax exemption. The first 40000 Euro (NZ$68,500) in Ireland is exempt tax for creative and original work. http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money\_and\_tax/tax/income\_tax/artists\_exemption\_fro m\_income\_tax.html I think this is an interesting idea that could be explored, in particular Maori art and culture but also other artists, musicians, dancers, etc if they are of national significance (possibly sport for emerging fields, not for rugby, football, netball etc). The Maori art and culture exemptions could help build small businesses in regions such as Northland, and other tourist regions giving people a chance to establish themselves in a business. If it was only available in several regions it might encourage like minded people to move out of the big cities into small towns, or perhaps a new satellite village purpose built on leasehold or Maori land could be built where like minded people could move to. As they will create their own job and perhaps eventually jobs for others it could reduce unemployment in the regions. Microloans and business mentoring for start ups would be useful here. This could be trialled as a pilot scheme initially and expanded if successful. 14 Tax Base and Inequality It is fashionable at the moment to complain about the rich getting richer, inequality, poverty and the greedy baby boomers etc. Much of this hysteria has been stirred up by a small group of economists and people with interests in their own equity based businesses. They have the public believing that if the wealthy were to pay more tax poor people would be much better off but is this true? And do the wealthy really not pay their share? In reality the top decile by income pay 35% of all income tax and the top half pay of income earners pay more than 80%. The bottom 40% after cash transfers receive more than they pay in tax and even after GST most of these would pay no tax at all. Clearly the top income earners are paying at least their share, at least of those that declare all their income. Another fake facts that people seem to believe is that wealth is a fixed pie that some people have more than their fair share of. Of course wealth is not fixed. For example Facebook, Apple, Trademe have all created billions of dollars for their owners, but if these companies hadn’t been invented that wealth would not exist. Much of these people’s wealth is tied up in shares of their own companies. Some wealth like land (not houses), minerals, time etc are different as they are finite resources. If this “created wealth” is used to buy a finite resource that does affect other people. E.g. if Mark Zuckerberg used all his wealth to buy as much land as he could that might affect land prices for home owners. Or if he used it to buy other companies’ products or services that would be a good thing for the economy. Otherwise the wealth could double or halve and no one else would be affected at all as much of it is on paper. For example look at how a Zuckerberg managed to lose billions of dollars in a few days because of the Facebook scandal. That has shrunk the wealth pie so has presumably made the inequality gap smaller but in real life that makes no difference to poverty. I believe that rather than taxing that “created wealth” more it would be much more productive to facilitate wealth building and growing the wealth pie through small business and micro enterprises to expand the tax base. Some areas could be planting trees, tourism, art and culture. I include houses in “created wealth” as they are in practice relatively unlimited. Anyone can build as many as they like for themselves if they have the money. Land however is in limited supply so I can see in some ways taxing it could be justified if you think of it belonging to the country and being leased to the “owner” - a bit like a licence to occupy or like the Maori concept of rangatiratanga. Land is not “used up” by its owner like limited resources are. But any land tax would need to be at a very low rate and for all land including family homes otherwise it would create cash flow problems and distortions between owners and renters as mentioned above. It may be difficult for farmers or cash poor elderly to pay but that could be resolved by being accrued as a debt against the value of the farm or home to be paid when it was sold. Time is another limited resource which unlike anything else, everyone has the same amount of in a year! This is not taxed at all. Wouldn’t it be interesting to look at taxing people’s time on a notional rate of income like some other assets such as foreign funds! This is a 15 completely opposite concept to a universal benefit’s premise that the world owes everyone a living. What if everyone owed the community a certain amount of time per month or year just for the privilege of living in New Zealand (a bit like jury service)? I think this could raise community spirit and get labour intensive jobs done. For example tree planting, sorting recycled rubbish, volunteering on a marae or for a community based group like a church or Plunket, weeding reserves, cleaning up waterways, helping clean up after natural disasters, care giving, meals on wheels....... I am sure there are plenty of possibilities. Charities and other organisations could apply annually to have a certain number of volunteer hours allocated to them. Lawyers who provide legal aid do this kind of thing in a way, and other professions could provide free hours of whatever their skills are to low income people (doctor, dentist, accountant) if they preferred that to volunteering for a more manual job. People who do not wish to contribute time could buy back their own time at their own hourly rate. Unemployed people would also be given a compulsory task to “volunteer” for as a prerequisite to receiving their benefit. Having to show up and contribute could have a positive affect if they meet other people in the community, learn new skills, possibly find paid job opportunities as they work alongside working volunteers. Anyone who was medically unfit would be exempt. Large organisations like government, local body and banks, insurers etc could volunteer to be involved in setting up and facilitating working parties with their own staff. If it became a compulsory requirement for people to contribute their time (a time tax) they would not need to pay the staff more or do the activity in work time (although they could if they chose to), just coordinate the efforts. If 2 million people gave 2 hours per month that could be around a billion dollars of productivity gained in a year. In Australia some corporates do this already. In fact there are many positive effects associated with volunteering: http://www.volunteering.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Business-Case-for- Corporate-Volunteering.pdf In past generations and civilisations many beautiful buildings like cathedrals and churches, art works etc were built using practically slave wages and volunteers. Older houses often have beautiful time consuming detail. These days with minimum wages these sorts of things have been lost as nobody can afford to pay a proper wage for this sort of “unnecessary” work as it isn’t financially viable. Perhaps introducing compulsory volunteerism some community projects could be achieved that would not otherwise be sensible financially but would add value, culture or beauty to the community. In future with the advent of changing technologies (robots, AI, globalisation) the number of people in employment paying income tax may decline unless replaced by other jobs. The Universal Benefit solution proposed by TOP has tried to address this by taxing the wealthy more. Taxing everybody equally based on their time taking into account their skills and talents seems to be a fairer way to supplement any lost income tax rather than taxing the wealthy more. In fact this is probably the fairest tax system of all! 16 Other points on Welfare and Inequality The current tax system is unfair on single working people on low incomes, and biased towards parents with children. This creates a dangerous incentive to have more children than you can care for yourself. The latest $60pw baby payment will not reduce poverty. It will lead to more children being born into homes that are in poverty, therefore it will lead to more children living in poverty in several years time. Once a child turns 2 there will be an incentive to have another to keep the extra money coming. There needs to be some balance that incentivises young women to get educated, get money behind them, and build a stable relationship before having children. This is a better way of reducing poverty than giving out more money. A tax rebates or in work credit for low income single and childless people so as not to disadvantage them over those with children would do a lot to reduce this inequality. The extra cost of this would likely be offset in a savings in Working for Families payments and “baby bonuses” in future years if it meant women weren’t incentivised to have babies they really can’t care for properly. These babies are often the ones who end up mistreated, and end up as teenagers committing crimes, failing in the education system and unable to find employment. This segment of society has a much higher birth rate than middle to upper income NZ. Some papers I have seen suggest we will need to rely on this group to provide a larger percent of younger people to fill the gaps in the work force left by the baby boomers retiring. They still fit the same pyramid distribution of ages as in the previous diagram above for the early 1900s, while the middle and upper income families’ pyramid is now inverted. I fear that instead of helping to solve the aging workforce problems they may add to the problem by requiring long term welfare themselves. Volunteering as a budget adviser I have seen many low income and unemployed single people struggling to make ends meet and when I look at their budgets there is nothing that can be done. They don’t have enough to live on. One time I met a single woman with 5 young dependent children (3 of them belonged to her sister who has 12 children). She had more than enough income if she didn’t waste money. I have seen her dish out $50 at a time to the young teenagers, and these children wander the streets and buy alcohol, junk food and cigarettes with it, wag school and generally cause trouble. This must not seem “fair” to a single person who can’t make ends meet, and it is wasteful of resources. If these are the children we will rely on to make up the young work force we have a problem which needs to be urgently addressed. I trust this will be “solved” when the welfare working group is formed. Thanks for reading through my ideas. I am happy to be involved in discussing these or other ideas/ issues relating to tax and welfare. 17 Appendix 1 – Some Housing Solutions in brief notes 1. Leasehold. Small house container village (like Christchurch container mall) can be quite quickly put up on land which is retained by housing NZ, Maori land, or other large site e.g. closed schools or hospital. (Princess Margaret). First home buyer can buy small house (20-30m2) for < $100k, lease the land at say 3% rent pa so total outgoing might be as little as $250 per week allowing further savings (and energy savings). Buyer can pay off quickly and on sell to get deposit for next home. Increase annual land rent in line with land price so no nasty rises like old leasehold land homes. Mixed private and state ownership model. Council can buy them as they come up for sale or sell them off as desired. Can down the track relocate them to build permanent buildings on land. 2. Fund land purchase for idea 1 above by issuing inflation linked government bonds, interest linked to rent, capital linked to land value. Market to e.g. baby boomers. There is a shortage of investments that are inflation linked for capital and income which is why people buy rental properties. Some people may sell their rentals if another inflation linked option was available. Alternatively buy land and hold in a Social Property unitised fund as part of a financial provider’s KiwiSaver’s options. Again this would give inflation linked income and capital returns for investors wanting to move out of active property management. 3. Or the Government itself could start to buy land to lease to potential home buyers to build on and hold it as an asset in the NZ Superannuation scheme. It could then receive the indexed linked income and enjoy the capital gain. They would then have the ability to slow down the cost of house price increases that are linked to land price increases. I would look very long term and start to buy up bulk land for future satellite cities near Auckland and Wellington that could be rezoned for housing in the future. 4. Down-sizing – better use of existing housing capacity. While there is a shortage of homes there is probably not a shortage of capacity in terms of bedrooms. Many people are stuck in their large houses after their spouse has died but it is too difficult to move. If elderly, or single people in larger homes than they need are incentivised to down size into a smaller home (e.g. help with moving and sale of property both physically and financially either as a loan or grant) this would free up larger homes. This would create a need for more smaller homes than are available now but these need less land and are quicker to build than family houses. 5. Reduce council rules for multiple dwellings for tiny houses for 1-2 people (20- 30m2). In Christchurch development contributions are high so it is not viable to build a small house as it is more profitable to build 2-3 bedroom apartments. Parking, access, minimum size rules are also unhelpful. It is very on-trend at the moment to build small energy efficient houses. They could be fitted behind existing houses in leafy suburbs to maintain a pleasant streetscape. Access can be walk on, with storage for bikes/scooter. Probably more palatable for NIMBYs than fully blown development. Container house can be brought in on truck and easily removed later if required. Or prefabs could be built in the regions and shipped in - jobs for small towns.

Submission on Taxation – GST exemptions for rates, electricity, public transport and single-ingredient foods Mike Bedford 29 April 2018 I can be contacted at: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Thi s brief submission advocates removal of GST on some necessities of life, encourages use of public and electric transport, and encourages purchase of foods associated with healthier diets. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Brief principles Taxation should be the collective investment of part of a population’s wealth for public good. There are few principles I believe should apply to taxation: 1. Taxation should be benefit a society as a collective, while avoiding unfairness or unduly limiting personal freedoms. 2. As far as practicable, taxation on the basic necessities of life should be avoided. No-one should be required to contribute to the collective until their basic needs have been met. You shouldn’t be asked to pay for motorways if you can’t feed your children. 3. A tax should not be subject to tax. 4. Taxation should not discourage a public good. 5. Taxation should not incur undue cost due to complexity, allowing that no taxation system will be perfect. Fiscal needs and tax revenue New Zealand currently has serious damage to many government funded systems including health, education (especially early and special education) and social welfare systems, requiring substantially increased government expenditure. Reduction in overall tax take would be a problem. Loss of revenue due to GST exemptions could have a small offset from capital gains tax, but I would support an increase in upper bracket income tax to balance GST relief for essential costs of living. \[1\] Rates Rates are the locally administered component of the taxation system, and should not be subject to tax. They are a compulsory component of housing costs, by way of direct payment or via rent, and are therefore an essential cost of living. Rates include compulsory provision of necessities such as water and sanitation. Electricity Electricity provides for the costly necessity of heating, as well as cooking, refrigeration and lighting. It is also a favourable alternative to fossil fuels for transport, and should be encouraged. Gas is used for heating and cooking, but it is a fossil fuel, and electricity is almost universally available as an alternative. Land-based or water-based public transport There is no need to explain the societal benefits of public transport over private transport, and New Zealand has seen a change in local infrastructures for shopping and services that makes transport a basic need. Reducing public transport fares by 15% provides an incentive to use public transport, which in turn supports the viability and efficiency of public transport systems. Removal of GST on single ingredient foods (excluding alcoholic drinks) Food is a necessity of life, but can also be a luxury. No simple tax discrimination applied to food will be perfect, but I see removal of GST on single ingredient foods to be simple enough to be workable and beneficial. It removes GST on all fresh produce including fruit, vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, milk, nuts, grains, flours, and many frozen items such as frozen vegetables or meat. It does not remove GST on sugary drinks and snacks or a great range of other non-essential food items. For clarification all food cooked to order (takeaway or restaurants) would still attract GST. The system would need to exempt permitted additives or residuals, such as free flow agents, a percentage by weight of salt, antioxidants or trace residuals from processing, in the same way that permitted additives are handled in law currently. It might also exempt combinations of a small number of specific product blends such as blended flours, nuts, juices or vegetable mixes, to minimise unintended tax discrepancies. It is likely that the system would be subject to objections from retailers citing complexity, but it is easy to understand, and once a retailer had adapted their systems, ongoing administration costs would be negligible against other retail costs such as advertising. Most food is sold through supermarkets, and supermarkets have the purchasing power to require their suppliers to identify their product’s GST status and give a guarantee of compliance. Bar coding and software can easily split out GST exempt sales for accounting purposes. The system wouldn’t be able to perfectly divide necessities from luxuries, and there would still be slight distortions in the cost of some foods, but that is the compromise of simplicity. It would certainly favour essential foods over non-essential foods. There would be no requirement to identify the GST status of a product at retail point of sale, but it could be used on packaging to promote the food. The system would also provide for and encourage local GST-free businesses that supply only those food products that are exempt, such as fresh produce. The overall effect would be to encourage healthier diets and reduce basic food costs.

TAX WORKING GROUP - SUBMISSION Michael Rutland Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make a submission to the Tax Working Group (TWG). I propose to answer the specific questions posed at the end of the Submissions Background Paper about our taxation system and try to include some personal comments in the appropriate sections. Chapter 2: The future environment Comment => Before putting together my response to this section, I would like to comment on a couple of issues that are potential causes for confusion. The first is that the NZ integration of the welfare system with the tax system makes it difficult to be sure whether the aspects being considered are solely about tax/government income, or about the combined tax and government welfare payments. My comments are based on using the latter (Tax + welfare). One aspect of this issue is that if one assumes that the government welfare payments are part of the tax system, then the considerations below will include all of government income but only part of government expenditure – messy! Another is that several of the issues below have aspects that are outside the usual area of taxation, and one or two are very poorly related to taxation. But when the TWG asks for feedback about the impact of the tax system on a particular situation, the responses it gets are likely to be focussed solely on the taxation aspect of those issues. This risks asking for biased responses and getting them. Finally, the TWG seems to be asking solely about taxation by central government, but a considerable amount of tax is also levied by local governments. When local government used its money solely for the management of local resources and services that could be regarded as a reasonable exclusion, but there has been a recent trend for local governments to tax and spend in ‘social’ aspects of their communities, and as that overlaps with central government functions it would seem appropriate for the TWG to now include local government revenue raising in their inquiry. What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? => Firstly congratulations for concentrating on the medium to long term. Looking back I am strongly of the opinion that the tax changes which have caused the most problems in the NZ economy were those that were hastily introduced as short term response to long-term problems, or taxes that should have been introduced but never were. Secondly, our current taxation system is almost entirely related to turnover (income, production and sales), and so in terms of risks and challenges these are the same for taxation and the economy as a whole. As a result, one of the risks to the economy/tax system is the tax system itself. If taxation damages the economy, then the long-term tax take will suffer. Opportunities are very few. There have been lots of possible tax increases mentioned in the media and community, nearly all of which are aimed at stripping more money out of the existing contributors, and all of which are likely to cause long term damage to the economy and the tax-base. It is the nature of taxation to only be applied to the successful, but the more taxation is applied, the smaller the proportion of the population that are able to achieve success. New Zealand now has a relatively small proportion of the population contributing most of the tax, and we are now bordering on the point that further taxation of this group will be counterproductive. It is interesting to note that in the USA there are calls for a ‘flat-tax’ system, as the wealthy are regarded as failing to pay their share of the tax. In NZ there is opposition to the concept of flat rate taxes, or increases in taxes that have flat rates. Risks and challenges to the tax base can be predicted from past performance. We now live in a global economy, and as a very small part (0.3%) of it we have very little influence and end up trying to adapt and exist within a framework that the major players set up, usually to their own advantage. The current concentration of wealth and income worldwide is occurring with the approval and compliance of the major economies. There is little point giving this process our verbal support or criticism, and even less in ignoring the situation or even heading off in a different direction and believing that we can persuade the \[1\] rest of the world to come around to our way of thinking. So we need to adapt our actions (including our tax system) to operate within this environment. It is worthwhile recognising that Eastern Europe and China (which represent ?(19)% of world GDP) have changed from Communist/Command economies to Capitalist/Free-Market economies and that Western Europe, North America and India (approx. 50% of world GDP) have been operating capitalist economies for centuries. Important Groups – I would like to suggest that in terms of taxation, there are essentially four groups that are relevant to the NZ tax system. (1) Dependents – individuals and households that are net beneficiaries of the taxation system, and who rely on the state for some or all of their costs of daily living. This group have a considerable number of advocates, usually lobbying for greater benefits, but I believe their most important need is for sustainability. They cannot afford the state to run short of money. (2) Workers – individuals and households that are in paid employment and who are mostly contributing to the government’s tax income, but who do not have enough saved wealth for any investment income. This is the usual state for most of us in the first decade or two of our productive life, and even longer for those whose incomes remains low. This group make relatively minor contributions to the government’s income but the work they do is vital to the current functioning of the economy, and it is from this group that new members of the third group will come. I believe that it is particularly important to our future that paths remain open for savers from this group to evolve into savers and investors, and one of the most positive actions of previous governments in this respect was the initiation of Kiwisaver. (3) The Taxable Rich – are a mixture of individuals and home-based companies that have more than enough for simple survival, and have saved/invested their surplus. They have or use investments that create wealth, jobs and production. The majority in NZ are people who have been long term savers and are now well on in their careers or even retired. This is the group that is making the major contribution to government tax income, and in a somewhat bizarre reversal of logic, it is the group that receives the most public criticism! This group is not only the major tax contributor, but relatively immobile and individually weak. By necessity they have to live and work within the financial and tax structures set up by the NZ government. However, as a group, the wealth that they own is the one aspect of the economy that prevents New Zealand assets falling into the hands of offshore interests and the group 4 entities. (4) The Super-rich and Multinational Corporations control huge amounts of the worldwide wealth and income, and are highly mobile. They are not a new phenomenon. The Medici family was enormously rich and powerful during the renaissance; The British East India Company was virtually a law unto itself; Cecil Rhodes controlled huge amounts of the southern African economy; Aristotle Onassis owned a significant proportion of the world’s shipping at a time when sea trade was highly profitable. The financial strength and the mobility that these individuals and corporations possess gives them the tools they need to bend governments and the rules to their advantage or to move to more advantageous regions of the world. Although the Submission Background Paper indicates that Countries are now working together to get some tax out of these entities, the fact remains that they have gamed the tax system for decades whilst everyone else has had to pay tax, and whilst home-based businesses and entrepreneurs have had to compete against corporations with huge resources and a minimal tax bill. So what of specific threats and opportunities to the tax system and economy? A few suggestions follow below:- Job Losses – Paid employment in the OECD is under pressure from two main sources, namely competition from low-paid workers in developing economies, and automation. Job losses will reduce the government’s income from income tax, and if the jobs move offshore, then there will be an additional loss of company tax. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to be the next step in this process. This process is likely to continue into the foreseeable future, but it can be mitigated. If NZ investors still own a share of the companies that are producing goods (both here and overseas), then at least the profits will remain in or come back to NZ, and tax will be generated from those profits. One of the effects of job losses is that production has never been less dependent on labour and more dependent on capital. If we lose both jobs and capital we are all going to end up poor. In this situation, large scale immigration will be a threat to the future economy. Expanding the population when there is likely to be a shortage of available jobs in the future will do little for government finances. The Concentration of Wealth - Capital and Capitalism are on the rise around the world, and virtually all of the new wealth is in the hands of a small number of individuals and/or companies, many of which have only been operating for a relatively short time. The individuals are rich enough to avoid personal taxes by not being tax-residents of any Countries, or by hiding their wealth. I note that for all the criticism of tax shelters in the Caribbean and central America, Britain still maintains the ‘confidential’ status of capital based nominally in the Channel Islands. The mega-corporations are still able to negotiate tax credits for investing in many areas of the world. I understand that when the Tesla Corporation was negotiating with various US states as to where it would build its new battery factory, tax credits worth Billions of US dollars were being offered. There are two main problems when these entities pay less tax than everyone else. The first is that a greater tax burden falls on those individuals that do pay tax and the second is that competition becomes weighted in favour of those corporations and individuals who pay least tax. The rise of capital around the world is not a process that NZ can alter, and so we are in the position of working within a system that others control. If the NZ tax base is to be protected, then NZ investors need to encouraged, and not eliminated. Good or bad? If we put aside the capacity for concentrated wealth to avoid or minimise taxation, the question remains as to whether such concentrations are good for the economy, bad or irrelevant. There is certainly a great deal of criticism by the public, the media, economists and governments. I believe that, these groups are so determined to criticise concentrated wealth that its positive features have been deliberately ignored. Concentrated wealth has been at the forefront of development and progress for the past 50 years. Equally important is that it keeps a significant part of the global wealth and power out of the hands of governments. Governments have a uniformly bad record of managing wealth. Virtually all democratic governments are in debt, with much of their spending being for consumption. So it is reasonable to believe that concentrated wealth is the main driver for progress, and our taxation choices may well determine whether New Zealanders are part of the process or simply consumers of other peoples’ developments. The Changing Nature of Capital – We are all used to thinking of capital in terms of items that undergo little or no change, like land and buildings, most of which are relatively immobile. However, the growth of capital has recently been about more transient items like machinery and more mobile items like intellectual property. These items degrade over relatively short periods of time, and may require increasing amounts of money to maintain or replace their value. Recent economic reports on National capital indicates that in developed Countries the amount of money spent simply maintaining capital (at a constant fraction of GDP) is 3-5% of GDP for government assets (like roads and structures), and 18% of GDP for privately owned capital items. Why is this relevant? It is because it demonstrates a need to keep injecting more capital just to stay in the same position and implies that any actions that degrade confidence in the value of ‘new capital’ places the future economy at risk. Human Nature - Envy – Many years ago Margaret Thatcher spoke about the ‘Politics of Envy’ and its negative impact on society when individuals expend their time and energy pulling others down rather than building themselves up. One of the main mechanisms through which envy operates in developed economies is through the tax system. In the past, left wing governments were voted in with an agenda of taxing wealth off those who hold it. This occurred in post-war Britain, and although it was successful in taxing wealth off many with historical holdings, the money was spent on government consumption and it delivered no long term benefits to the economy as a whole. The British economy was already dominated by industrial production and heading in the direction of increasing intellectual property. Chucking a few nobles off their historical holdings was almost irrelevant in terms of money, but it is interesting to note where the assets ended up. A few ended up with the National Trust and became public assets, albeit ones that often required public donations or government subsidies for their maintenance. The government itself spent the money, and the majority of the assets taxed off the historical holders ended up owned by the ‘New Rich’, some of whom were foreign nationals or offshore companies. The current groundswell in New Zealand of antagonism against those perceived to be wealthy ignores several important features of their contributions to the economy and the government coffers. Firstly, the Submissions Background Document itself shows that the top 10% of earners pay 35% of the income tax. If this group have their wealth taxed off them, then everyone else will need to pay considerably more tax or accept much lower government services. I note that comments about GST always refer to the proportion of their income on which the lower paid are levied GST, as this is the one figure that creates sympathy for the poor. Several other features about GST are conveniently ignored as they create less such sympathy:- (1) Every increase in GST in NZ was associated with a compensatory increase in welfare payments. (2) The total amount of GST paid by higher wage earners is still much larger than the total amount paid by the poor. (3) The rich pay a great deal more income tax. It is common to point out that when the rich invest/save some of their earnings, that reduces their GST contribution, whilst conveniently ignoring the fact that when their income is taxed at 33%, there is only 67% for spending and contributing to GST. Unless they save more than half of their post-tax income, income tax causes an even greater reduction in the GST paid by the rich than their savings. Company Tax is probably where the rich make their largest relative contribution to both the economy and the government tax-take. Once again there is a great deal of publicity about the concentration of wealth in the top 20% of earners/owners, but near silence about the fact that the shares held by these individuals account for most of the company tax paid to the NZ government and underpin most of the productive jobs in the country. Neither the lower paid, nor the government itself have shown any ability in saving money/capital, and so the only way to keep capital and ownership of industry in this country is to leave it in the hands of the 20% of savers. The one bright exception to the previous comment is the development of Kiwisaver which is providing a much-needed pathway for all New Zealanders to start saving. Competition & Protectionism – These two features go hand-in hand. 35 years ago when the NZ economy was opened up to international competition, the motivation was partly a belief in the economic value of open trade, and partly pressure from other countries that were justifying their protectionism against NZ exports on the basis that the NZ government had been subsidising the rural aspects of the economy. The fact that most of the nations placing (or threatening to place ) high tariffs on imports from NZ were themselves subsidising their own food production, often to a greater degree, is an important indication that we were (and still are) living in an unfair world. When I started writing this submission there was a great deal of talk about protectionism, and by the time I was half-way through, America and China were actively involved in the opening clashes of a trade war. NZ is already involved, and even though it is working its concerns (about China dumping steel) through the agreed channels, we may yet see retaliation against those items we export to China. There is an additional aspect to competition, namely that many of our businesses are competing against offshore companies that pay low wages and have low safety and compliance costs. Food Manufacture – A great deal of New Zealand’s economy and export income is related to farming, and producing food at the expensive end of the food market. There is now a new process of food production, namely the production of carbohydrates, fats and proteins by yeasts (often genetically modified yeasts) and by cell cultures; and the subsequent conversion of those basic foodstuffs into forms that are nutritious, tasty and cheap. These ‘manufactured’ foods have two important advantages, the first being cost and the second is their endorsement by a growing vegetarian and vegan movement. It is likely that the NZ Agricultural Industry will be facing increasing competition from manufactured foods. Of course, this process might also offer opportunities, if there are New Zealanders who are willing and able to invest in these new food production processes Fresh Water – The quantity and quality of water worldwide is a matter of considerable concern, and the world is already seeing Countries preparing to enforce their claims to rivers that flow through several Countries. New Zealand has had the luxury of plentiful high-quality water supplies, but some would argue that those supplies are now under threat by a failure to protect them. In an odd way, the failure to tax fresh water resources sends a message that they have no value, which encourages poor management. It is all very well to regard water access as a ‘right’ for all citizens, but we should also remember that the usual fate of a common resource is to be exploited to destruction. Resources/Recycling/Waste disposal – This is an aspect of the economy that contains both threats and opportunities. We have recently been using and disposing of materials wastefully. In many ways this requires a change in the way we think and value the environment, but changing the way people think is often more successful when poor practices cost money and good practices are rewarded. The taxation system probably has a role to play in persuading the nation to use materials less wastefully and recycle whenever practical. Globalisation – Globalisation represents a combination of opportunities and threats, however, recent history indicates that in developed Countries, globalisation has been a particular threat to tax systems. Globalisation has increased the number of opportunities for individuals and companies to evade taxation in some Countries, and either avoid taxation or transfer their tax liabilities to low-tax Countries. These opportunities for both tax avoidance and tax evasion are primarily available to companies and individuals with contacts in more than one Country. If our own producers are to compete on an equal footing, then we need a tax system that minimises the opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion of this nature. As was finishing this article, I noticed that there was a bid in place for a large Phillipines Corporation to take over Tegel Chicken. That would create the ideal circumstances to transfer the profits to another country and legitimately avoid paying any company tax in New Zealand. Which of these are most important? => Difficult. Do we place greater or lesser emphasis on medium term or long term issues? Looking back at past performance, it is clear that governments are not very good at ‘picking winners’. So, logically, the government and tax system should encourage lots of new ideas and processes, and let those that are most valuable prove themselves. As regards threats and opportunities, the top of my list would be globalisation and the ability to transfer income to other locations. How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? => Stability is what we need the tax system to deliver, as we don’t know which of the predicted problems and opportunities will come to fruition; when that will happen and how large an impact there will be on the economy. However, it is clear that we are living at a time of rapid and significant changes to the national and world economies, and that the world population has reached a point at which environmental degradation and access to resources are becoming major issues. The front line of our response to these situations is our business community and the associated investors. Stability of taxation is important to the entrepreneurs trying to develop and respond to new opportunities. They are already taking several risks and the last thing they need is an additional risk of unknown or variable taxation. As regards current forms of taxation, there is not a great deal of opportunity for change. GST is already somewhat high by OECD standards, and increases would be politically unpopular. However it does have positive features, in that whatever happens to the economy, there will always be consumers, and visitors pay the tax as well as residents. Consumption taxes will always deliver. The main problem with consumption taxes is their interaction with welfare payments. The GST from welfare payments is of no net benefit to the government so it is important to avoid either welfare or consumption taxes becoming too high a proportion of government activity. Company Tax is well up by OECD standards and we are in a world where ‘race to the bottom’ is becoming more of a reality than a slogan; Income tax take is now so concentrated in the upper two income deciles that further increases could well be counter-productive, with individuals diverting investments away from productive enterprises and into situations with lesser tax liabilities (as mentioned in the information document and as occurred when the Muldoon administration raised the top personal tax rate to 66%). The one positive feature of the NZ tax system is that the total tax take is not particularly high. So it seems likely that one of the best taxation responses to future changes will be doing nothing and trusting the citizens to respond to the challenges and opportunities. How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? => It can’t. Whilst it is pleasant to note the successes in the Maori economy, the reality is that it is still a small component of our small economy, and as such it is far more likely to be a follower than a leader. Specifically, the future tax system needs to fulfill the requirements of the major components of the economy. A cynical person could well look at the data in the background information document and conclude that future Maori involvement will be similar to current Maori involvement which is heavily weighted towards the ‘government transfers’ aspect of the tax system. One of the problems of the enterprise elements of the Maori economy is the lack of transparency. There are occasional articles in the press suggesting that Maori enterprises are treated differently by the government from the main economy, and it is difficult to assess the veracity of those articles because of a lack of reliable data. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system. Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? => Sustainability; Economic growth; Fairness? => Sustainability is the most important. As we now have almost half the households in the country as net beneficiaries of the tax system, the single most important feature is to avoid anything that will have a negative impact on government income. Growth is also a necessity because the world economy is changing and growing, and we need to do the same just to maintain our current position. Fairness is far less important. There is no value in having the entire population equally poor. The most likely outcome of policies that tax the wealth off the rich is a permanent reduction in government income. Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? => Fairness means treating people the same. The only truly fair tax systems are poll taxes and proportional taxes. In the context of a taxation system this implies flat rates, no thresholds and no exclusions. I find the phrasing of the question troubling, particularly after reading the Submissions Background Paper. There is an implication that fairness in taxation is somehow different from fairness in the rest of life (and this smacks of ‘newspeak’). When the Submissions Background Paper indicates that taxation should be related to peoples’ ability to pay, I wonder how many other aspects of the law only expect compliance from those people who are able to obey the law? So it is important to recognise that there is an inherent unfairness in the taxation system that is biased against those with higher incomes. All that remains is to minimise the severity of that unfairness. The concept of fairness/unfairness also needs to be considered in a wider context, namely inter- generationally and internationally. A tax system that fails to keep up with government spending will deliver a progressively increasing debt to future generations and is manifestly unfair to them. We are now in an increasingly global economic environment and our wealth generators (agriculture, industry and investors) are effectively in competition with other Countries, many of whom have shown their willingness and ability to distort their own taxation systems in ways that favour their citizens and disadvantage outsiders (ie us). A tax regime that fails to recognise advantages available to offshore competitors might have the appearances of fairness, but actually deliver unfair outcomes. Globalisation has provided opportunities for those individuals and companies with a presence in several Countries to choose where their profits will be taxed. The world is slowly dealing with illegal ways in which those opportunities are being exploited, but there are still plenty of legal opportunities for tax avoidance that are only available to multinational corporations and the mega-rich. Fairness and Equity are not the same. I would recommend an article in the New Scientist (31 March 2018) that explores this disparity. It could well be important, as I suspect that many people use the two ideas as if they are the same, which has the potential to cause confusion. As an example, equity would imply paying workers the same, regardless of the number of hours worked, whilst fairness would pay the same hourly rate, delivering more to those that worked longer. Most of us prefer fairness to equity, and accept that as we are all individuals, fairness will naturally end up with inequity. When the state reduces inequity by making some individuals pay high tax rates whilst giving others money back with a negative tax rate, the mechanism is essentially an unfair one. Equity is treated unfairly by the press, the government and the public. The past few years have seen a huge number of articles about inequity of income and wealth, and the arguments are concentrated on two aspects. Firstly they are all about inequity of income/receipts. The Submissions Background Paper provides evidence of income inequality and uses the Gini Index as a numerical measure of that inequality. It demonstrates that Income Inequality has a Gini Index of 46 for pre-tax/welfare income, and this falls to 35 (less inequality) after tax/welfare payments. This reduction in inequality is described as being beneficial. What is totally ignored is inequality of contribution. I have used the data from the Background Paper to calculate a Gini Index for contributions to the income tax/welfare system. Before tax/welfare the inequality of contribution produces a Gini Index of 49; after tax/welfare the Gini Index for contributions inequity rises to 155. The reduction in the income Gini Factor is associated with a much greater increase in the contribution Gini Factor. If one were to consider both income and contribution, one might suspect that the total inequality has risen. The second aspect concerns inequality of wealth. This is treated as if it is bad for society. However, the majority of the productive jobs in the economy and nearly all of the company tax are related to private wealth investment, which is concentrated in the top 20% of NZ wealth owners and in offshore hands. There seems to be an assumption that redistributing this wealth would be beneficial to society, but a more likely prediction is that redistributing the wealth held by the top 20% of NZ wealth holders to the government and the remainder of the population would result in it being spent for consumption, and ending up owned wholly offshore. We already have a situation in which there is four times more offshore money invested in NZ than NZ money invested offshore, and should assume that profits are moving in the opposite direction and contributing to the balance of payments difficulties. The inequality of wealth distribution may be politically unpopular, but the wealth held by resident New Zealanders is one of the few factors preventing offshore domination of the NZ economy. What would a fair tax system look like? => Flat Rates - No thresholds – no exclusions (as per my comments earlier) and that should include a system that prevents offshore interests having advantages. Not long ago, the phrase ‘Taxation should be applied where the profits are earned’ appeared, and it is a good description for company tax. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system framework. New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. => Comment The claim to be ‘broad-based’ certainly applies to GST which applies at the same rate to a wide range of items Company tax is a little more complicated. It is certainly applied more or less evenly to companies, but most of those companies are owned by the top 20% of earners. When one considers who is the effective taxpayer, then the somewhat small number of shareholders (as a proportion of the population) makes the claim to be ‘broad-based’ somewhat shaky. However, the claim to be broad- based falls down completely for the largest component of the tax system, namely income tax, in which a relatively narrow band of citizens (the top-earning 20%) pay most of the tax. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? => To quote a former Prime Minister “If it ain’t broke, then don’t fix it”. The tone of the Submissions Background Paper seems to imply that NZ has a tax system that is working well and has less problems than taxation in many other counties, so why the section asking for changes? I would suggest firstly, that having extolled the virtues of a ‘broad-based’ taxation system, the country should work towards creating a system that is actually broad-based. This would entail reducing inequality in the income tax contributions, ie flat or flatter rates. In the short term, rather than changing the basis of the tax system, I believe the government should concentrate on ensuring that it is applied fairly. In particular, ensuring that offshore vendors and owners pay the appropriate amount of tax. To some extent, our current company tax regime does well in that respect, and I would urge the government to avoid joining the ‘race to the bottom’, which is currently led by Ireland and several small island nations off the French and American coasts. In the longer term, we should be prepared for worldwide changes. One thing that will remain constant is that there will always be consumers in NZ, and so consumption taxes (eg GST) will be reliable sources of government income and may need to increase if other taxation sources decline. Employment is becoming less secure, and so we need a system that is flexible. The current ‘stand-down’ period for welfare discourages the unemployed from seeking short-term employment, which needs to be addressed, as changes to employment legislation are currently driving employers towards fixed term contracts and favoring contractors over regular employees. Taxes and behaviour. Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? => YES ...but We need to be clear and transparent about whether the purpose of such taxation is to eliminate certain behaviors or to modify them. If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? => (1) Spending/Saving. New Zealand needs savers. Taxation can either encourage savers or discourage spenders. I recommend increasing GST and avoiding taxes on capital/savings as a way of tilting the balance towards savers. I do not recommend reduced taxes for savings as it may well distort investment decisions. I strongly recommend increasing the contribution limits to ‘Kiwisaver’. Kiwisaver has proven its value. Particularly its ability to include those of us who are not natural savers. The long term benefits to the NZ economy will far outweigh the short term costs. (2) Tobacco Consumption is a major health problem for individuals and for society, and the current intention to tax it into extinction should be continued. (3) Alcohol also causes damage, but unlike tobacco it can be used positively by most of the population. I recommend increasing taxes on alcohol, but with the intention of reducing excessive or harmful use whilst leaving access to alcohol open to those in the community who can use it safely. This is a solution that will provide a tax income for the government on a sustainable basis. (4) Fossil fuels – I have no faith in the current carbon trading scheme which offers far too many advantages to those who are dishonest, and delivers relatively little to the government. It would be far preferable to have a carbon tax which would deliver income to the government and encourage the development of low-carbon energy sources. (5) Sugar consumption appears to be a health hazard that is almost as important as tobacco consumption (albeit without any secondary exposure). Logically, we should therefore consider taxation as a way to reduce sugar consumption. (6) Plastics are becoming recognised as a growing environmental hazard, almost like the solid equivalent of Carbon Dioxide. I am not sure whether the best management approach is regulatory or taxation, but the latter may well have a role to play. (7) Waste Disposal is intertwined with environmental protection. This is currently managed mainly by regulation, but a combination of regulation and taxation offer the possible combination of a ‘carrot and a stick’ approach. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? => NO. The government should certainly encourage retirement savings, possibly even make it compulsory. BUT the tax system is not the best way as it risks distorting the investment aspect of the economy.. If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? => Interesting, basically YES, the current balance is satisfactory. There is a need to be clear on the meaning of ‘speculative economy’, especially as it is a term that evokes a great deal of public antagonism. Speculation in terms of the economy can range from investing in an item in the hope that its price will rise, to investing time, money and effort into a new process in the expectation that it will lead to new or improved production. The latter type of speculation has two important features, namely that it is the process that has led to nearly all the improvements in industry that we enjoy today, and secondly that whilst we enjoy the fruits of those ideas that were successful, we need to remember that there were also a large number of failures, probably 80% or more. If we wish this type of speculation to continue in NZ, then we need to allow the losses on failed speculations to be offset against other taxes. Furthermore, I would suggest that those losses be counted against any other taxes, as that would allow small players to participate. If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? => Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? => Many of the problems businesses face are not about taxation, but are caused by other regulations. It is increasingly difficult to lay off workers who fail to contribute or even cause damage to a company’s production or reputation. It is increasingly difficult for businesses to expand without objectors making the process uneconomic. I suspect that most businesses are more concerned about such difficulties that stop them making profits, than paying tax on those profits. There is one aspect in which taxation is important, namely offshore competition. Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? => YES, but by doing almost nothing in this field. To a considerable extent, there is concern that future changes will have a negative impact on natural capital. If capital (cash/resources) taxes were introduced, then there would be pressure for owners of ‘natural capital’ to generate some or more income from their property in order to cover the taxes. Capital taxes encourage owners to aim for greater production from all their capital, including the ‘natural capital’. Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? => YES and most of them are overseas. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? => Failure to tax all imports; Failure to control local taxes. Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? => Untaxed Imports. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? => NO Before introducing new taxes, we need to ensure that the existing ones are being properly applied (see above). Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? => YES. The TWG is required to look at the distribution of taxation, but not the total tax take which is intended to remain at 30% of GDP for this government. I believe that there should be limits on the proportion of the economy/GDP that the government controls, and so if additional taxes are raised them some other taxes should be lowered (and vice versa). In general, I believe that consumption taxes (GST) should be raised and production taxes (Income and company) should be lowered. PERSONAL COMMENTS => A feature of the tax/welfare system that has frequently come up for discussion in recent years is a Universal Basic Income (UBI) with the usual model being one in which the government pays all citizens a basic income, and income tax is applied with no threshold and at a uniform rate. The advantages are said to be economic, in the form of simple administration and removing the current welfare penalties for those who work intermittently. The current concerns are more ‘social’ in nature, with most of the public happy to pay for welfare to citizens who are unable to work due to age or illness, but not keen to pay for a life of idleness for those individuals that could work but choose not to contribute to society. It may well be that if jobs become scarcer in the future then public attitudes will change, but whilst NZ is importing laborers for jobs citizens are unwilling to do, support for a UBI is likely to remain low. Having said that, the current NZ tax and welfare system comes quite close to a UBI in performance, with the main difference being the long ‘stand-down’ period that penalises the unemployed from taking up short term employment. In many ways, the NZ integration of income tax and welfare payments is actually closer to a UBI than many overseas trials that were based on a uniform guaranteed payment but only to unemployed individuals, and without including the general population and taxation changes. I note that Finland has recently trialled a scheme that is somewhat like UBI in part of that Country, and has decided not to expand their UBI until the results have been analysed (2019). It would seem prudent for NZ to wait for that (and any other) analysis. One of the difficulties of a UBI is that it changes the appearances of the economy, but not the reality. If the government hands out significant amounts of money to every citizen and then taxes much of it back again, it is mostly a paper exercise, and there has been no real change in production or consumption. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? => Taxation is not the primary problem. The main problems with housing affordability are related to demand (and immigration), supply, and cheap credit (from quantitative easing). The only role taxation might have played in modifying affordability would have been to tax the inflow of cheap credit, but it is now too late and implementation would have been difficult. However, it may be worthwhile having a plan in place in case a further episode occurs. As regards the taxation differences between owners and renters, I believe that the current taxation regime is adequate. Owner-occupiers get minimal assistance in acquiring a capital asset and pay no taxes (to central government) for owning and occupying their house. The rental situation is different. It is a providing a service, and (like other services), taxes are levied on the profits. If housing were treated differently to other assets and businesses, the result would create distortions to the tax system that are undesirable, and which would almost certainly be exploited where possible. However, there is great potential for unfairness if capital taxes or CGT were applied to one type of house (rentals) and not to owner-occupied houses. I realise that taxing owner-occupied houses is unpopular politically, but introducing unfair taxes for political advantage is a bad way to go. Local Taxes (Council Rates) are the one aspect of taxation that have a direct impact on housing costs, but seem to be ignored by the TWG, and indeed by the central government as a whole. So whilst the TWG is required to work within the limitations of no net increases in taxation, most councils have no such restrictions, and have been raising the local taxes much faster than inflation. Stealth taxes also feature in housing costs. Government actions have recently transferred the costs of paying for the public service aspects of the fire services (formerly paid from taxation) onto the insurance premiums. This is not only a matter of hiding the tax contribution but it has a threshold that creates differential rates for owner-occupier homes and commercial property owners. If the government is calling for fairness in taxation, then the community should pay its share of the costs of emergency services. Tax Credits are an aspect of taxation in which rental properties are treated differently from other industries. In most industries, all equipment is regarded as a business expense and profits are calculated after allowing for equipment replacement. In rental housing the IRD defines almost all equipment as ‘capital’ so that replacement has to be from post-tax income. This is an unfair definition and has a direct impact on rent costs. Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? => NO, tax changes to manipulate housing affordability are more likely to distort the housing market in ways that increase complexity and inequity. They would also risk inducing compliance problems. Owner-occupier houses currently produce little tax, and as they are considered to be a ‘social good’, there is little to gain by changing their tax-status, other than to include them if any asset taxes were introduced. Rental accommodation is part of the productive economy and we are better off treating it in a similar way to the rest of the productive economy. Having said that, I note that the welfare system does regard accommodation as a special case, with specific welfare payments related to housing, and that the state also acts as a ‘renter of last resort’ at considerable cost to the taxpayer as it seems to end up with many tenants whose behavior has made them unacceptable to the commercial rental market. If so, what changes would you recommend? => NONE. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? => NO. Firstly by excluding the family home, such a tax would not be broad-based, and excluding the family home would legitimise the process of taxing elements of capital gains differently. All our other major taxes (GST, income and company) have few or no exclusions, so excluding the family home would remove a huge proportion of the County’s capital from the tax and indicate that this was an ‘anti-rich’ tax, rather than a tax that everyone pays. Secondly it sends a signal that the government disapproves of people being wealthy. Thirdly, for commercial properties (including residential rental properties) the buildings themselves represent the means of production. I believe we should be taxing production and consumption, but not the means of production. In one sense, NZ already has a capital gains tax for those situations in which work and money is put into a project with the intention of increasing its value prior to sale or re-sale. But the current concept of a capital gains tax (CGT) implies taxing any increase in the value of an asset. Nearly all of these gains are related to external events and are not under the control of the owner(s). Inflation is one of the most important drivers for increasing capital values, and nearly all inflation is due to government overspending. For this component of CGT the tax would end up rewarding the government for a poor economic performance. The greater the government deficit, the higher the inflation rate and the more CGT it gets. In the worst case examples (like Zimbabwe), the combination of CGT and hyperinflation would effectively end up with the government having taxed all private property off its owners. Cheap Credit has fuelled the recent rapid rise in house prices, and is a result of QE in the northern hemisphere. Once again, unrelated to the actions of property owners in NZ, but if there were a broad-based CGT in NZ then the actions of those northern hemisphere governments would have ended up increasing the tax burden on NZ property owners. Economic destabilisation is a likely consequence of both CGT and capital taxes. We already have a large amount of money tied up in housing and a somewhat smaller amount in productive enterprises. Capital and capital gains taxes will suppress the value of many capital items, causing financial difficulties to those who currently have very low equity levels. This is a process that would be made worse by excluding owner-occupied homes and only applying such taxes to productive enterprises like farms, shares and rental accommodation. Capital taxes and CGT are anti-green. When such taxes are applied, it becomes necessary to gain the maximum production possible from the capital items. For farming that means more intensive methods. For accommodation that means higher rents and/or smaller dwellings. For factories that means more pressure on the workers and/or less workers. We would end up with the IRD branch of the government creating taxation pressures on the environment, savers and workers whilst other branches of government are busy creating more regulations to try and protect the workers and environment. Capital Losses will create one of two significant problems. If capital losses can be claimed as a tax refund or credit, then the government itself is exposed to a significant risk to its income. In addition, it is likely that there would be growth in the ‘capital loss industry’, similar to the deer schemes of the 1980s. If capital losses are not allowed, then not only is the system itself inequitable, but its application will be inequitable, with small owners liable for the full tax whilst large companies can still gain tax relief by lumping their capital positive and negative projects together. Alternatively, if capital losses do not create tax credits, then the government is effectively taxing risk. Risk is necessary for growth. If the costs of risk are high then investment is weighted towards conservative projects and growth slows. The world economy is currently in a stage of rapid growth and being too conservative at this point in time would be a mistake. If so, what features should it have? => ABSENCE should be its primary feature. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? => NO. Capital taxes send a message that the government does not want people to be rich. Not only is that a very poor attitude, but as the NZ economy currently has relatively few home-based savers, it makes the economy dependent on overseas investors and creates a drain on the economy when the profits from offshore investors head back offshore. In addition, a land tax implies that this form of capital will be taxed, whilst other forms of capital will escape taxation. Finally, any capital tax is verging on double-taxation, as many assets are purchased with post-tax income, so levying a ‘possessions tax’ is very close to taxing the same item twice. If so, what features should it have? => ABSENCE, once again. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? => In general terms those that are easiest, cheapest and impact on the most important environmental problems. It may also be worthwhile exploring the possibility of refunds/credits/negative taxes for processes like recycling that reduce the environmental impact of the items mentioned below. Greenhouse Gasses should be top of the list. The current carbon credit scheme is a waste of time and effort, and almost universally abused. It should be abandoned and replaced with a tax on greenhouse gas emissions. It should also be applied to imports so that home-produced goods compete on an equal footing with imported goods. Plastics especially those that currently have a single short-term use like bags, wrappings cups and packaging. Waste water is a matter in which taxation is one aspect of governance. The starting point should be regulations about standards and maximum levels of contaminants. After that, taxation may be useful in motivating people and enterprises to modify the quantity, quality and form of disposal in ways that minimise harm to the environment. Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? => NO, but eliminating unfair competition from less-taxed competitors would help all businesses. Small and start-up businesses are better encouraged with grants, rather than tax changes. In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? => NO. GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? => NO. One of the positive aspects of the NZ GST system is the uniform application. If so, what should be excluded? => AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE. What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? => NOTHING. But GST is one of the ‘fairest’ taxes that there is and if anything the GST rate should be increased to compensate for reduced tax income from other sources and as a general move to discourage spending and encourage saving.

Further, such entities also qualify for the issuance of a Resident Withholding Tax certificate under s RE27 RWT exemption certificates of the ITA 2007 and s 32E Applications for RWT exemption certificates of the Tax Administration Act 1994 at s 32E(k) with respect to interest and dividends received. Another section of the ITA 2007 that the author wishes to bring to the attention of the TWG which is deserving of further inquiry is s CW 46 Bodies promoting amateur games and sports, give that today there a number of entities claiming tax concessions under the ITA2007 yet it is evident that they are anything but in the business of promoting amateur games and sports. However this issue is not canvassed further in this submission. Should the Tax Working Group (TWG) so wish, the author is able to provide further details on these issues as well as appearing before the TWG in person if that option is of assistance to the TWG. Alternatively, other forms of communication are acceptable to the author. The author has no objections to his Submission being made available to the public. What is the issue? The author submits that there are two significant equity, or more correctly inequity issues, in the ITA 2007 concerning tax policy which no government has taken to the Select Committee stage to allow interested parties to put their cases before the Committee for Parliament to then make determinations on those issues. These are: \[1\] 2 • Large scale commercial trading being undertaken by “charities” where that trading is unrelated to those charities charitable purposes; • Trading being undertaken by “vet clubs,” an anachronistic post-WWII mechanism by which certain professional veterinary practices are acquiring “vet clubs” to take advantage of the “vet club” exemption from income tax. Solutions to the issues The Author respectfully recommends that: • Charities which undertake commercial trading activities as limited liability companies that are unrelated to their charitable purposes be required to make charitable distributions which the current philanthropic regime allows as deductible items to the extent of their taxable net income under s DB 41 Charitable or other public benefit gifts by company to a separate registered charity or charities with income tax being paid on retained profits; • Professional veterinary practices which claim income tax exempt status based on a concept developed in post-WWII New Zealand, that of “vet clubs,” be required to pay income tax on the basis that this exemption is anachronistic and no longer relevant; • Amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 be placed before the House to allow interested members of the public to make submissions at a Select Committee convened for the purpose in order that all sides can express their views on these two issues in a democratic way. Part 1: Charities and taxation Since the first substantive review of taxation in New Zealand in 1967, that of the Ross Committee and successive reviews, as outlined in Appendix 1, no government has proceeded by placing an amending section to the income tax legislation requiring charities that undertake commercial activities to pay income tax before a Select Committee in order that those with an interest in the issue might have their democratic say before Parliament deliberates on the matter. Not surprisingly, the history of charity taxation in New Zealand is bereft of such debate. Even at the time of the enactment of the first true income tax by William Pitt in 1799, which contained an income tax exemption clause regarding charitable purposes, no debate on that significant section was reported in reports of Parliamentary debates. However, the Author doubts that neither in Pitt’s time in 1799, nor in New Zealand in 1891 and 1892 when our first true income tax Acts were introduced, did either Parliament contemplate that commercial activities would claim charitable status, particularly to the extent evident in New Zealand today. 3 In 1892, rectifying an oversight on the introduction of the Land and Income Assessment Act 1891, 1 which exempted the land of “\[p\]ublic charitable institutions constituted under The Hospitals and Charitable Institutions Act 1885, and charitable institutions not carried on for gain or profit,” 2 an exemption from income tax regarding public charitable purposes was provided for in the Land and Income Assessment Act Amendment Act 1892. 3 In 1940, during the debate on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill the Hon Mr Nash stated: 4 ... if \[an\] organization earns money that is spent overseas, then, if it is a trading organization, that trading profit become liable to taxation. The portion of the profit, however, that is spent charitably in the Dominion is not liable to taxation. “Missions,” said Mr Nash, “are exempt, as they are not in business.” 5 However, charitable businesses that operated solely in New Zealand were exempt from income tax with respect to “\[i\]ncome derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of trustees,” or the business of any society. 6 In doing so, disregarding the developments in the UK in 1927, a tax inequity was created. Today, under s DB 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007, companies can now donate to the extent their taxable income and claim a deduction for that amount. That, in effect, was what Mr Nash had said in 1940 with respect to charitable business that remitted funds overseas. However, companies with charitable status are not required to pay tax on retained funds that are not applied to charitable purposes, which the author argues is inconsistent with the recommendations of numerous tax reviews over the years. This is also inconsistent with the tax policies of the fons et origio of New Zealand’s charity law, England, concerning charities and primary trading. In the 1920s the issue of trading by charities surfaced in the UK when, as the result of a case stated by the Commissioners for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax concerning the charging of fees by a public school, the \[UK\] Finance Act 1921 was amended in 1927 with 1 54 & 55 Vict. No. 18 (8 Sept. 1891) 2 At s 16(1)(g). 3 56 Vict. No 54 (11 October 1892) at s 3(4). 4 Hon Mr Nash, Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill” NZPD Vol 257 (18 July 1940) at 601 (author’s emphasis). 5 \[Editorial\], “Income Tax Amendment Bill” Auckland Star Vol 71 Iss 170 (19 July 1940) at 9. 6 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1940 No. 3 (19 July 1940) at s 5. 4 respect to income tax under Schedule D in respect of the profits of a trade carried on by any charity so that any such profits were exempt only where: 7 (i) the trade is exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the charity; or (ii) the work in connection with the trade is mainly carried on by beneficiaries of the charity. Today, those comparable provisions can be found in the \[UK\] Income Tax Act 2007 C 3 ss524- 525 with respect to charitable trusts, and in the \[UK\] Corporation Tax Act 2010 ss 478-479 with respect to charitable companies. For clarification, the guideline on trading published by the Charity Commission for England and Wales explains that “primary purpose trading” is “trading which contributes directly to one or more of the objects of a charity as set out in its governing document.” 8 A report by a charity tax specialist in 2010 gave an example of a church with charitable status, its charitable purpose being the advancement of religion. 9 The sale of religious books qualify as primary purpose, whereas the sale of non-religious books do not. However, in the UK a pragmatic approach is taken whereby allowances are made for small scale non-charitable trading with respect to annual turnover, the limits of which are: 10 o £5,000 o If the turnover is greater than £5,000, 25% of the charity’s total incoming resources, subject to an overall upper limit of £50,000. The qualifying factor is that commercial activity which is unrelated to the charitable purposes of the entity is taxable for purposes of the income tax and corporation tax legislation. Hence, in the case of a public school in the UK, the charging of fees is permissible given that the advancement of education is a charitable purpose, in accordance with the principles laid down in Pemsel in 1891. 11 There is a direct relationship between fees charged by public schools and the provision of education, as is the case in New Zealand with respect to private schools. 7 Finance Act \[17 & 18 Geo.

The net equity of such entities now runs into the billions of dollars, yet successive governments appear reluctant to address what the author considers to be a failure of the most basic of tax policies, that of equity and fairness espoused by Adam Smith in 1776. 12 The author has frequently been contacted by people who find their businesses competing with income tax exempt entities and who consider this to be unfair, given the distinct fiscal advantage an income tax exempt entity has over a taxpaying business, in particular the ability to accumulate funds at a faster rate than an income tax paying entity. It is not only the charity sector where such an inequity can be seen, as this is also evident with respect to another anomaly in the Income Tax Act 2007, that of so-called “vet clubs” (see following discussion and at Appendix 2). The Author does not consider that at this stage it is necessary to name names, on the basis that the members of the TWG will be aware of many of those charities from media commentaries and public debate over the years. However, an overview of the sectors of the economy where such commercial activity is being undertaken may be of assistance: • Commercial property development • Tourism • Hotel accommodation • Fisheries • Electricity generation • Geothermal energy • Forestry • Dairy farming • Livestock • Food manufacturing • Commercial rental properties • Seafood production and processing 12 Adam Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” (London, Grant Richards, 1776) Vol 2 at 471. 6 • Vineyards/wineries • Freight • Public transport – land and air • Quarrying • Real estate • Communications • Recycling A government (taxpayer-subsidised) subsidy The Operational Statement (“OS”) published in December 2006 by Inland Revenue recognises that registered charities benefit from fiscal concessions both directly in the form of the income tax exemption and indirectly through donee status, as well as other tax concessions, such as an exemption from Resident Withholding Tax This is clearly stated in the OS: 13 The Government has acknowledged the enormous contribution that the charitable sector makes to New Zealand. To aid in the funding of charitable organisations the Government provides a subsidy in the form of an exemption from income tax that allows such entities spending on charitable purposes to be made out of untaxed income. Other tax benefits are also provided. Many charities and other organisations also receive an indirect subsidy through allowing donors to qualify for a rebate from their income tax. The cost of the tax credits paid to donee organisations is able to be quantified, as can be seen in each year’s Tax Expenditure Statement (“TES”), the forecast for 2016/17 being $247 million. 14 The forecast for charitable or other public benefit gifts by way of a company deduction was $21 million. 15 The TES also details the various tax expenditures that are included in the Income Tax Act 2007, such as gifts by companies (s DB41), and exempt income, including charitable business exempt income (ss CW 41-43) to the extent that funds are applied 13 Inland Revenue, “OS 06/02 Interaction of tax and charities rules, covering tax exemption and donee status” (December 2006). 14 Treasury, “2017 Tax Expenditure Statement” (25 May 2017) Table 2 Quantified Tax Expenditure and Spending through the Tax System at 5. 15 Treasury, above n 14 at 5. 7 in New Zealand. 16 However, no attempt is made to quantify the charitable business exempt income and related tax expenditures which are subsidised by the taxpaying public. An anomaly rectified: Government trading It is interesting that no recent government has taken the recommendations concerning the commercial activities of charities as reported in various tax reviews seriously (see Appendix 1), given that past governments recognised the unfairness of government commercial activities competing with tax-paying entities. In 1940, during the debate on the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill, the Hon Mr Ward stated that he was “glad” that the Bill required State trading departments liable to income tax, “because these departments are in competition with private business and it is only right that they should pay their income tax.” 17 It is curious that the government in 1940 introduced this as a tax policy to restore a level playing field yet in the same breath exempted businesses which claimed charitable status from income tax. An example from the relatively recent past illustrates this – the Natural Gas Corporation. On being constituted under the Natural Gas Corporation Act 1967, the corporation was exempted from land and income tax. 18 The Hon. T. P. Shand explained that the reason for exempting the corporation from taxation was that “the corporation will have to make sufficient profits during its lifetime of 25 years to repay the money it has borrowed,” and that taxing the corporation would make it more difficult to do repay the national development loans which had funded the venture. 19 This is precisely the issue businesses face when they find that they are in competition with income tax exempt businesses being run by registered charities – there is a clear advantage in being exempt from income tax. However, in 1976 the taxation exemption provision was repealed, 20 with the corporation being required to operate from “a more commercial aspect.” 21 This implies working in competition with other energy providers and the requirement to pay income tax levels the playing field. Why should this not also apply to the charity sector? 16 Treasury, above n 14 Table 3 Tax Expenditures Included in the Income Tax Act 2007 at 8-9. 17 Hon Mr Ward, “Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill” NZPD Vol 257 (19 July 1940) at 648 (author’s emphasis). 18 Natural Gas Corporation Act 1967, No. 41, s 24. 19 Hon.

While this is relatively new to New Zealand, Dr Tricia Fitzgerald, a researcher of social enterprise, states that in the UK there are “an estimated 80,000 social enterprises which together contribute £24 billion (NZ $50 billion) to the UK economy.” 22 Dr Fitzgerald is also reported as saying “\[i\]magine a world where ordinary commercial businesses have to compete with those that also deliver some environmental or social value – the potential for societal and business transformation is huge.” 23 That may be so, but what of tax equity implications? In the UK, the rules concerning trading and charities also applies to social enterprise activities when they have charitable status. 24 To quote a UK commentator: “\[c\]arrying on a ‘social enterprise’ does not confer any tax benefits on an organisation. A charity will be exempt from tax on trading as a social enterprise if this falls within its primary charitable purpose.” 25 In Canada “\[t\]he taxation of, or tax exemption of, social enterprises revolves around the provisions of the Income Tax Act and its interpretation by \[the Canada Revenue Agency\]... However, opinions differ ... and confusion reigns.” 26 One of the questions being asked in Canada in 2015 was, “\[s\]hould registered charities be allowed to carry on businesses that are not related to their approved charitable purposes to support themselves or should the charitable status of such charities be revoked as often is the case now?” 27 One suggestion was that Canada could adopt a UBIT regime – unrelated business income tax – as applied by the IRS in the USA. 28 With calls for the need of new legal forms, 29 whatever form of entity under which social enterprise is undertaken, unless New Zealand adopts an income tax exemption policy with respect to unrelated trading activities undertaken by charities as applied in the UK this country will find that the tax base continues to be insidiously eroded while at the same time international tax policy experts are engaged, on a larger scale, with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. 30 22 Tricia Fitzgerald, “From charity to social enterprise: when making money is good” University of Auckland ( 2 October 2017). 23 Fitzgerald, above n 22. 24 Buzzacott, “Social enterprise – From a tax perspective” (October 2009). 25 Horwath Clark Whitehill, “The tax implications of charity trading” (March 2010) at 137. 26 Drache Aptowitzer LLP, “Hope for clarity in all things social enterprise” (12 November 2015). 27 Drache, above n 26. 28 Drache, above n 26. 29 Amanada Cropp, “Social enterprises mull tax-break push” Press (28 September 2017) at A10. 30 See BERP at www.oecd.org. 9 10 Part 2: Veterinary clubs and taxation Veterinary clubs, societies or associations, and similar organisations which carry on trading activities should be subject to income tax in respect of the profits derived from such activities.

OECD Working Party on Agricultural Policies and Markets (2005) The following commentary are extracts from a detailed report submitted to the National Government (Hon Todd McClay) and Inland Revenue in 2015 by the author. 31 The full report is provided at Appendix 2 of this Submission. Since 1951 veterinary services bodies, that is veterinary clubs and the Veterinary Services Council, have benefited from a concession which exempts them from income tax. This concession followed the creation of such bodies in 1946 following the introduction of the Veterinary Services Act in post-WWII New Zealand. The rationale for the concession was that the functions of veterinary clubs, as well as herd improvement associations which were also granted an exemption from income tax, were “of national importance and they should be exempt from tax accordingly.” Times have moved on and while the rationale was applicable at that time, New Zealand’s economic situation is now quite different from that of sixty years ago. However, there are certain entities that describe themselves as “vet clubs” which are anything but, and use the income tax exemption to gain a distinct competitive advantage over their for-profit competitors. This competitive advantage through the ability to accumulate funds at faster rate than that of their for-profit entities is due not only to the exemption from income tax, but also to the exemption from resident withholding tax which was introduced in 1989. In 2001 a submission to the Tax Review described the income tax concession as an anachronism. Further, even the OECD had concerns in 2005 about such a concession, as well as tax experts in New Zealand since 1967. 31 M.J. Gousmett, “’Vet Clubs’ Veterinary Services Bodies and their Fiscal Privileges” (15 November 2015). 11 While the Veterinary Services Council was created by statute in 1946 under a Labour government (Peter Fraser), with one of its functions being the establishment of so-called “vets’ clubs,” it was not until 1955 that the VSC and its siblings were granted an exemption from income tax by the National government (Sidney Holland) when the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill provided, at clause 8, “an exemption from income tax and from social security charge on the income derived by the Veterinary Services Council, and also veterinary clubs and herd improvement associations.” 32 In moving the Second Reading of the Bill on 26 October 1955, the Hon Mr Watts, Minister of Finance, stated that: 33 \[c\]lause 8 confers exemption from income tax, and, therefore, also from social security charge, \[on\] the income derived by the Veterinary Services Council, and also all veterinary clubs, and herd improvement associations. Their functions are of national importance and they should be exempt from tax accordingly. One condition of the exemption will be that no individual member will be able to derive private pecuniary profit from the clubs or associations. It is necessary to provide for the exemption to be made retrospective to 1951, to regularize the exemption which has already been granted, on the assumption – now found to be erroneous – that the present law was sufficient to grant the exemption. What then, was that “present law” that was “now found to be erroneous?” The principal income tax legislation in force in 1951 was the Land and Income Tax Act 1923 34 until the legislation was consolidated and amended in 1954 in the form of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 35 There is no evidence of any amendments to the 1923 Act between 1923 and 1951 regarding veterinary services bodies, and it was not until 1955 that a specific exemption from income tax for the VSC, veterinary clubs, and herd improvement associations, was provided in the amendment to s 86 of the principal (1954) Act in the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1955 at s 8 (1)(oo): 36 Income derived by the Veterinary Service Council established under the Veterinary Services Act 1946; and income derived by any veterinary club, society, or association, whether incorporated or not, which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting efficient veterinary services in New Zealand, if no part of the income or other funds of the club, society, or association is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder thereof: Income derived by any herd improvement society or association ... 32 Land and Income Tax Act Amendment Bill, NZPD (19 October 1955) vol 307 at 3196. 33 Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill, NZPD (26 October 1955) vol 307 at 3381. 34 Land and Income Tax Act 1923 \[28 August 1923\] No 21. 35 Land and Income Tax Act 1954 \[30 September 1954\] No 67. 36 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1955 \[27 October 1955\] No 91 s 8 (1). 12 Section 8(2) provided that the section was to apply “with respect to the tax for the year of assessment that commenced on the first day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and for every subsequent year.” 37 Today, the format and wording of the relevant section in the Income Tax Act 2007 that provides an exemption from income tax to veterinary associations, clubs and societies differs from that of 1955, as seen in s CW 50 Veterinary services bodies: 38 Exempt income: veterinary clubs (1) An amount of income derived by a veterinary association, club, or society is exempt income if – (a) the association, club, or society was established mainly to promote efficient veterinary services in New Zealand; and (b) none of its funds is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of a member, proprietor, shareholder, or associate of any of them. Exempt income: Veterinary Council An amount of income derived by the Veterinary Council of New Zealand is exempt income. The intent of s CW 50(1)(b) was broadened as part of the rewriting of the Income Tax Act 1994, which was finally completed on the passing of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 November 2007, by adding the term “associate” into the existing section CB 4(1)(f) on the basis that “the policy underlying \[the wording ‘proprietor, member or shareholder’\] is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a pecuniary profit.” 39 The exemption from income tax for herd improvement bodies now resides in s CW 51 Herd improvement bodies of the Income Tax Act 2007: An amount of income derived by a herd improvement association or society is exempt income if – (a) the association or society was established mainly to promote the improvement of the standard of dairy cattle in New Zealand; and (b) none of its funds is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of a member, proprietor, shareholder, or associate of any of them. 37 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act, above n 36 s 8(2). 38 Income Tax Act 2007 \[1 November 2007\] No 97 (reprinted as at 1 April 2015). 39 Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 – Exposure Draft Part C: Income, CW Exempt Income at 220 (available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz). Note that neither of the two issues papers that were written by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, their purpose being “to promote discussion of minor policy issues relating to policy intent or clarification of legislation that arise from the rewrite, and to seek comment from interested parties,” discussed the veterinary services exemptions. See Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, “Rewriting the Income Tax Act \[1994\]: Parts C, D, and E” (March 1998) Issues Paper 1; (June 1998) Issues Paper 2. 13 In 1967 the Report of the Taxation Review Committee, chaired by L.N. Ross, (the Ross Committee,) in commenting on the veterinary clubs under s 86 (1)(00) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, noted that: 40 \[m\]any of these veterinary clubs carry on quite extensive business activities in the supply of stock medicines and veterinary services to members and others. They thus compete both in buying and selling markets with other forms of enterprise whose profits are subject to taxation. It is in keeping with our recommendations regarding the taxation of business profits of other exempt organisations \[ie trading charities\] that veterinary and other similar clubs and societies or associations should be subject to tax on the profits derived from trading activities. Accordingly, the Ross Committee recommended that “\[v\]eterinary clubs, societies or associations, and similar organisations which carry on trading activities should be subject to income tax in respect of such activities.” 41 However, a review of the New Zealand Parliamentary Debates following the tabling of the report in the House from 1967 through to 1970 suggests that this recommendation was not even debated, let alone implemented as a budgetary measure. According to the OECD, the income tax exemptions provided to veterinary clubs and herd improvement societies have had their day: 42 185. Tax revenue from the agriculture sector \[in New Zealand\] is an important component of government revenue. ... ... 189. Exempt income of veterinary clubs and herd improvement societies \[s CB 4(f)-(g)\]. These exemptions are historical. In the farming context they are not of any significance. The main advantage lies with the ability of these bodies to effectively re-invest their total profits in the provision of necessary infrastructure (buildings, equipment, vehicles, etc). Interest on borrowings for such infrastructure, and associate costs of depreciation and repair/maintenance are not tax deductible. The concession is effectively one of allowing these activities to grow at a faster speed (due to the ability to reinvest all net profits earned rather than net profits after tax). There is no distortion in investments decisions as a 40 The Taxation Review Committee, “Taxation in New Zealand Report of the Taxation Review Committee” (Ross Committee) (October 1967) Wellington, R.E. Owen, Government Printer at §783. 41 Ross Committee, above n 43 at p. 323. The Ross Committee also recommended at p. 313 that “\[p\]rofits from trading derived directly or indirectly by charitable organisations and dividends derived from any company substantially owned by such organisations are assessable for income tax at normal rates.” 42 OECD Directorate for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Committee for Agriculture, Working Party on Agricultural Policies and Markets, “Non-sectoral Policies for the Agriculture and Agri-food Sectors: Taxation and Social Security” (4 August 2005) AGR/CA/APM (2004) 13/Final (available at www.oecd.org). 14 result of this measure, as the exemption applies to all income earned from the club or society. Over time, these exemptions are likely to be withdrawn. While the income tax exemption granted to veterinary services bodies in 1955 was done so with a particular economic policy in mind, sixty years later the concession is being used in a manner that would not have been contemplated by Parliament in that the concession is being applied to commercial trading activities by veterinary services bodies thereby providing them with a distinct competitive advantage over their for-profit competitors through the retention of funds that allows a faster rate of growth that would otherwise be possible if those funds were applied to income tax liabilities. As a author to the 2001 Tax Review Committee stated, the concession is indeed an anachronism that should be removed from New Zealand’s income tax legislation. In 2005 the OECD also noted its inappropriateness and that in due course it was likely that it would be removed, yet ten years later the concession remains. The Author respectfully recommends that the government revisit the fiscal concession with a view to amending the Income Tax Act 2007 such that only bona-fide non-profit veterinary services bodies be able to apply the concession to their benefit and that the commercial trading activities now undertaken by veterinary services bodies be liable to income tax in order to level the playing field in terms of tax equity. Neither is it acceptable that because a shareholder, being a veterinary services body, has income tax exempt status therefore the concession can also be applied to the commercial activities of the related company. 15 Appendix 1 Taxation Reviews Report of the Taxation Review Committee (Ross Committee) (1967) Report of the Taxation Review Committee. 43 It is in keeping with our recommendations regarding the taxation of business profits of other exempt organisations \[ie trading charities\] that veterinary and other similar clubs and societies or associations should be subject to tax on the profits derived from trading activities. Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (McCaw Report) (1982) The Report of the Tax Force on Tax Reform, 44 chaired by P.M. McCaw (McCaw Report), whose Terms of Reference required the Task Force amongst other requirements “\[t\]o undertake a thorough and systematic review of all aspects of central government.” 45 However, at Chapter 12 the Task Force gave consideration to life insurance and superannuation, building societies, co-operatives, and charitable organisations. 46 The Task Force recognised that “\[b\]ased on information made available \[to the Task Force\], the cost of business incentives in revenue forgone is in the vicinity of $470 million per annum,” with a “strong” recommendation that those incentives “be subject to a rigorous assessment of costs and effectiveness on a regular basis.” 47 The Task Force “further recommend\[ed\] a more explicit accounting of all concessions and incentives to improve government management procedures in this area.” 48 In this regard, the Task Force also discussed the concept of tax expenditure budgeting, noting that in order “\[t\]o meet the fundamental objectives of government accountability and \[to achieve\] efficient and effective management, requires, as a first step, more explicit accounting of the cost of tax expenditures and their allocation (where possible) to the government’s economic and social programmes.” 49 Of significance is the observation by the Task Force that “\[b\]ecause they 43 The Taxation Review Committee, “Taxation in New Zealand Report of the Taxation Review Committee” (October 1967) Wellington, R.E.

The term “tax expenditure” is a concept created by former United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, Stanley Surrey, which The Budget Reform Act 16 escape effective government control, tax expenditures seem to be more difficult to terminate.” 50 Further, the Task Force also considered that “concessions intended to act as incentives ... \[that are\] provided through the tax system \[are\] inefficient.” 51 Regarding the income tax exemption of commercial activities undertaken by charities within the same sector as income tax liable for-profit entities, the Task Force recommended that while charitable organisations should be permitted to undertake their traditional fundraising activities, at the same time the government should “minimise” the scope for avoidance and reduce the advantages which accrue to income-tax exempt charities which operate in competition with taxable businesses. 52 It must not be overlooked that “both the Ross Committee \[1967\] and the McCaw Report \[1982\] suffered from the same major disability: “the lack of relevant data,” with the McCaw committee being “both surprised and frustrated by the lack of reasonably up-to-date statistical information which could be made available to \[the committee\].” 53 Government Economic Statement (1987) In 1987 the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, released his alternative economic statement 54 in which he proposed a raft of controversial measures, including the taxation of charities. 55 Amongst other measures, Douglas proposed the removal of personal tax rebates and deductions, 56 alternative funding support for charitable activities, 57 a reduction in the company tax rate, 58 the taxation of superannuation funds, life offices and related organisations, 59 measures to eliminate tax avoidance and to broaden the tax base by introducing a tougher international tax regime, taxing exempt organisations at normal rates and a new petroleum mining tax regime. 60 Douglas specifically targeted charities and sporting bodies, mutual associations, primary producer co-operative companies, primary producer and marketing of 1974 defined as “\[t\]hose revenue losses attributable to the provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability ... .” Stanley S.

However, some charities may engage in business activities unrelated to the charitable purpose for which they are provided a tax exemption. This exemption gives charities a competitive advantage over taxpaying business competitors. The report recommended that (emphasis added): 65 the government should review the tax treatment of charities and other tax-exempt entities that engage in commercial activities unrelated to their purposes. No reason exists in principle why business income, unrelated to the core purpose, should not be taxed. The committee made reference to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) regime applied in the United States and suggested that “\[t\]he government may wish to refer to the relevant United States legislation in designing rules for New Zealand.” 66 Tax Review 2001 (McLeod Report) The report in October 2001 67 In its submission, the New Zealand Business Roundtable of the report noted that: 68 \[i\]n particular, the pattern of domestic investment is distorted by significant differences in the effective marginal tax rates applying to income from alternative investments.

Further, the authors noted that: 69 \[s\]ome of these differences are due to practical problems associated with the assessment and collection of tax on certain types of activities ... other differences are due to explicit decisions made by past governments to use the tax system as a means of encouraging certain ‘desirable’ activities and discouraging certain ‘undesirable’ activities. Unfortunately, it is not clear to what extent the concessional tax treatment of certain activities is due to the practical difficulties associated with taxing those activities as opposed to a deliberate decision by the government to assist or deter certain activities. ... We believe the Review has an important role to play in affirming the view that the tax system should, as far as feasible, tax all activities and classes of entities on a neutral basis. It should also identify those activities that are currently subject to concessional tax treatment and determine the extent to which those concessions arise from either explicit government policies aimed at subsidising particular activities or entities, or practical income measurement problems. Tax and Charities (2001) The 2001 report “Tax and Charities” focussed specifically on the non-profit sector, making some interesting comments made concerning the income tax exemption, trading by charities, and tax policy. 70 While the issue of competitive advantage was raised, the final price of products was competitive with for-profits, therefore pricing was not the issue. 71 The issue, it was suggested, was the competitive advantage a charity could gain through the ability to accumulate tax-free profits thus enabling “a faster accumulation of funds \[which would allow it\] to expand more rapidly than its competitors.” 72 This was “the real competitive advantage that trading activities owned by charities have over their competitors.” 73 On that basis the Discussion Paper proposed that “\[t\]rading operations owned by charities would be subject to tax in the same way as other businesses, but with an unlimited deduction for distributions made to relevant charitable purposes.” 74 Ultimately it was not until 2007 when the new concessions for charitable giving by donors, companies and Maori Authorities were 69 New Zealand Business Roundtable, above n 68 at 49. 70 Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Department. “Tax and Charities – A government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies” (June 2001) at www.ird.govt.nz. 71 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.2 – §9.5. 72 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.6. 73 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.6. 74 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.7. 19 adopted by the removal of the caps on donations and deductions. 75 However, the issue of taxing the trading activities of charities was not pursued further by the government. 75 See Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 (19 December 2007) No 109. 20 Appendix 2 “VET CLUBS” VETERINARY SERVICES BODIES AND THEIR FISCAL PRIVILEGES A REPORT TO THE DIRECTORS, \[REDACTED\] Dr Michael Gousmett FCIS PhD 15 November 2015 Veterinary clubs, societies or associations, and similar organisations which carry on trading activities should be subject to income tax in respect of the profits derived from such activities.

This concession followed the creation of such bodies in 1946 following the introduction of the Veterinary Services Act in post-WWII New Zealand. The rationale for the concession was that the functions of veterinary clubs, as well as herd improvement associations which were also granted an exemption from income tax, were “of national importance and they should be exempt from tax accordingly.” Times have moved on and while the rationale was applicable at that time, New Zealand’s economic situation is now quite different from that of sixty years ago. However, there are certain entities that describe themselves as “vet clubs” which are anything but, and use the income tax exemption to gain a distinct competitive advantage over their for-profit competitors. This competitive advantage through the ability to accumulate funds at faster rate than that of their for-profit entities is due not only to the exemption from income tax, but also to the exemption from resident withholding tax which was introduced in 1989. In 2001 a submission to the Tax Review described the income tax concession as an anachronism. Further, even the OECD had concerns in 2005 about such a concession, as well as tax experts in New Zealand since 1967. This research paper explores the history of the income tax concession for veterinary services bodies, as well as that of RWT, and provides a number of case studies to demonstrate how these concessions are being used in a manner that was unlikely to have been contemplated by Parliament on their introduction. Finally, the paper concludes that the Income Tax Act 2007 requires amendment to ensure that such concessions are applicable only to bona-fide non- profit veterinary services bodies as intended by Parliament in 1955. 24 Part A The Income Tax Concession Part A of this research paper explores the history of the veterinary services bodies and their income tax concession, and discusses the findings of various tax experts on the issue, including the classification of the concession as a tax expenditure. Introduction Following discussions in 2014 and further communications in 2015 to the Hon Todd McClay, the Minister of Revenue, the author was approached with a request for a report on the income tax exemption granted to veterinary services in 1955 which, in the 21 st century, is now considered by some commercial veterinary practices (“the group”) as a matter of tax policy to be wholly unnecessary and unfair. In 2014 the Minister wrote to \[REDACTED\], the representative of the group, noting that: 76 • New Zealand has a broad base low rate system; • Officials had reviewed the latest financial statements filed with the Companies Office by 12 qualifying veterinary clubs; • The annual net profit of those clubs was about $2.3 million; • Income tax forgone on that amount was about $600,000; • The clubs are required to have commercial arrangements between themselves and their members which should limit any excesses; • As non-profit bodies the clubs are prohibited from distributing profits or gains back to their members; • Officials have been asked to further consider this issue when the tax policy work programme is next renewed later in the current year. On 16 February 2015 \[REDACTED\] wrote to the Minister observing: 77 • The benefits that the forgone income tax would provide to the revenue base, noting the broad base law rate system used in New Zealand; • That substantial assets may be being created without proper consultation with the members of veterinary clubs and that the excesses may not be limited; • That there is evidence of abuse of the tax system through the payment of bonuses to veterinarians to reduce profits and rebates being allocated in the following financial year; 76 Letter from the Minister of Revenue, Hon Todd McClay, to \[REDACTED\], 22 April 2014. 77 Letter to Hon Todd McClay from \[REDACTED\], 16 February 2015. 25 • According to The Daily Post, the Rotorua Veterinary Club spent $1 million to provide high end facilities that intentionally benefit non-members as well as subsidising associated services. 78 However, in 2014 NZ AgriVet reported that the cost of the refurbishment was $1.5 million. 79 The Origin of Veterinary Clubs In 1985, as a project for the Kellog’s Rural Leadership Course, Alan Grant of Lincoln University wrote an excellent study on the history of the veterinary club movement in New Zealand. 80 Grant considered that at that time the history of the development of veterinary services in New Zealand could be divided into three phases: 81 1. Pre 1946 – as farming developed in New Zealand post WWII the need for an adequate veterinary service was identified; 2. 1946 to 1970 – the Veterinary Services Council (VSC) was created by the Veterinary Services Act 1946 with the role of the VSC to be the establishment and maintenance of a veterinary service for farmers and the eventual graduation of students from the new veterinary faculty at Massey University; 3. Dissatisfaction with the level of funding required by the VSC from producer boards. The establishment of the VSC followed the work of a ministerial committee in 1943 and 1944 which was tasked with investigating and making recommendations on veterinary services in New Zealand, with the recommendations becoming the basis of the Veterinary Services Act 1946 (“VSA”) 82 : “to make provision for the establishment and maintenance of veterinary services for farmers, and for that purpose to constitute a Veterinary Services Council and define its functions and powers.” 83 78 Julie Taylor, “Animal care staff delighted after $1m makeover,” (24 May 2010) The Daily Post at p. 8. 79 Vet Profile, “Pursuing excellence in the provinces – high end care, without the high price” (2014) NZ AgriVet November/December 14 – 16 at 15. 80 Alan Grant, “The Veterinary Club Movement in New Zealand” \[A\] Project for the 1985 Kellog’s Rural Leadership Course 41 pp. See also: H.G.

For an interesting historical perspective on training as a veterinary surgeon in England in the nineteenth century see Roger M. Ridley-Smith, “The apprenticeship model in \[England in\] 1842” Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association 124:1332 (15 April 2011) 3pp. 81 Grant, above n 80 at 2. 82 Veterinary Services Act 1946 \[9 October 1946\] No 26. 83 Grant, above n 80 at 3. 26 Section 12 (1) of the VSA described the functions of the VSC as follows: 84 \[t\]he functions of the Council shall be to promote and encourage the provision of efficient veterinary services for owners of livestock in New Zealand; with a view to the maintenance and improvement of the health and general condition of livestock and the quality of produce derived from any livestock, and the increased production of such produce; and for those purposes to promote the training of a sufficient number of persons in veterinary science and their employment, when qualified, as veterinary surgeons. Grant noted that “in practical terms, these functions were classified into (a) training and employment; (b) formation of a policy statement to cover the formation of veterinary clubs, and (c) the organisation of veterinary services.” 85 In particular, with respect to veterinary clubs, Grant noted that (emphasis added): 86 \[t\]he aim of this policy was to co-ordinate the formation of veterinary clubs throughout New Zealand and to protect the interests of existing private veterinary practices where they adequately covered the needs of the area they served. The policy statement provided for contracts between the new clubs and the stockowners involved, and the club and the vet or vets employed. It also provided for a salary scale to make the remuneration of club veterinarians consistent throughout the country. The Veterinary Services Council would approve the areas serviced by each new club to ensure the economic viability \[of the club\] and define the boundaries of these areas to prevent overlapping of services. The policy statement also outlined the basis and level of subsidies to veterinary clubs and to private practitioners who either serviced areas not covered by a vet club, or who were in practice in an area before the Veterinary Services Act 1946 came into force. The aim of these subsidies was obviously to encourage the formation of clubs and to a lesser degree private practices in areas not yet serviced by a club, and at the same time not to give the veterinary clubs an unfair trading advantage over existing private practitioners. The first task of the VSC was “to produce a policy statement to cover the formation of the vet clubs.” 87 By 1951 56 veterinary clubs (“vet clubs”) had been formed and, by 1955, there were 63 vet clubs employing 150 veterinary surgeons (“vets”) which, by 1985, were employing 234 vets. 88 Then, in 1955 (emphasis added): 89 84 Veterinary Services Act, above n 82 at s 12(1); see also Grant, above n 80 at 3. 85 Grant, above n 80 at 4. 86 Grant, above n 80 at 4. 87 Grant, above n 80 at 4. 88 Grant, above n 80 at 8. 89 Grant, above n 80 at 9. 27 \[t\]he government played its part by enacting the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act which exempted from taxation the Veterinary Services Council and veterinary clubs provided that they met certain criteria on disposal of assets should \[a\] club stop practicing\[,\] and if they provided a predominantly veterinary service. This has played a very important part in the improvement of veterinary services by allowing all of the profits to be re-invested in better facilities or higher standards of service to farmers. It is not surprising that the advantages conferred by this \[income\] tax exemption are regarded as unfair by those in private practice who do not receive such an exemption. The VSC itself was also able to benefit from the income tax exemption as, according to Grant: 90 the VSC gave substantial financial assistance to fledging clubs in the form of direct subsid\[ies\] and grants, and was also expending large amounts on the training of New Zealanders at universities overseas and the bringing into New Zealand of suitably qualified foreign vets. However, it was also able to accumulate quite large sums of money in its reserve fund and accumulated fund into which any excess income from the year’s operations was paid. This gave the VSC the ability to fund its operations in later years when, in the 1970s, the VSC was “forced” to draw on its reserve and accumulated funds. 91 Grant concluded his study with his view of the future of the vet clubs (emphasis added): 92 I see for the future the vet club movement playing an equally important part in a farmer co-operative role providing an effective competition to the other forms of practice. By providing sound business management and utilising their inherent advantages of exemption from \[income\] taxation and generally larger scale of operation, the farmer executive members of veterinary clubs have the very real opportunity to greatly influence the form and efficiency of the veterinary service and the cost of that service – they must not underestimate or neglect this opportunity. And of the VSC itself? Grant saw a limited role for the VSC “as an organisation purely to act on behalf of the veterinary clubs and without its other functions, or to be handing full 90 Grant, above n 80 at 11. 91 Grant, above n 80 at 12. 92 Grant, above n 80 at 33. 28 responsibility to the New Zealand Federation of Veterinary Clubs.” 93 The Federation was formed in 1976 following dissatisfaction with the VSC that many considered “was becoming too autocratic and not truly reflecting the views of the farmer executive members throughout the country.” 94 The VSC was ultimately replaced in 1994 by the Veterinary Council of New Zealand, which also took over the functions of the Veterinary Services Board which until that time had been responsible for registering and regulating vets. 95 The VSC itself had previously taken over the roles of the Dominion Federation of Farmer Veterinary Services, and the Veterinary Services Committee 96 with the Veterinary Services Committee having been formed by the New Zealand Veterinary Association in 1943; the Association was incorporated on 4 April 1924. 97 Types of Veterinary Clubs Veterinary clubs were funded through a variety of means: grants from the Veterinary Services Council, debentures from farmers, and loans from banks and dairy companies. 98 There were three types of veterinary club: 99 • Dairy-factory clubs, which had compulsory membership of all farmers who supplied a particular factory; • Clubs set up in association with dairy factories, but with voluntary membership; • Clubs in dairying or meat and wool farming areas, with voluntary membership and no dairy factory involvement. The Formation of the Veterinary Services Council The Veterinary Services Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 4 October 1946 for its First Reading, 100 followed by its Second Reading on 7 October 1946. 101 The Third Reading took place on 9 October 1946, 102 and was given Royal Assent on that same date as the Veterinary Services Act 1946. 103 Nothing further was heard about the VSC in the House until 1950, when a question was asked concerning subsidies to veterinary clubs payable by the VSC being withheld due to issues 93 Grant, above n 80 at 33. 94 Grant, above n 80 at 21. 95 Hamish Mavor and Bob Gumbrell, “Later developments” in Veterinary Services (available at www.teara.govt.nz). 96 Mavor and Gumbell, “Veterinary Services Council” above n 95, at \[2\]. 97 Mavor and Gumbell, “New Zealand Veterinary Association” above n 95 at \[2\]; New Zealand Veterinary Association, No. 219096 at www.societies.govt.nz. 98 Mavor and Gumbrell, “Types of vet clubs” above n 95 at \[3\]. 99 Mavor and Gumbrell, “Types of vet clubs” above n 98 at \[3\]. 100 First Readings, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (NZPD) (4 October 1946) vol 275 at 418. 101 Veterinary Services Bill, NZPD (7 October 1946) vol 275 at 504. 102 Veterinary Services Bill, NZPD (9 October 1946) vol 275 at 574. 103 Veterinary Services Act, above n 82. 29 over the signing of standard contracts with veterinarians. 104 Then, in 1952, the Veterinary Services Council Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 1952 was “referred to the Government for consideration,” but no further action was taken. 105 The Income Tax Acts 1946-2007 While the Veterinary Services Council was created by statute in 1946 under a Labour government (Peter Fraser), with one of its functions being the establishment of so-called “vets’ clubs,” it was not until 1955 that the VSC and its siblings were granted an exemption from income tax by the National government (Sidney Holland) when the Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill provided, at clause 8, “an exemption from income tax and from social security charge on the income derived by the Veterinary Services Council, and also veterinary clubs and herd improvement associations.” 106 In moving the Second Reading of the Bill on 26 October 1955, the Hon Mr Watts, Minister of Finance, stated that: 107 \[c\]lause 8 confers exemption from income tax, and, therefore, also from social security charge, \[on\] the income derived by the Veterinary Services Council, and also all veterinary clubs, and herd improvement associations. Their functions are of national importance and they should be exempt from tax accordingly. One condition of the exemption will be that no individual member will be able to derive private pecuniary profit from the clubs or associations. It is necessary to provide for the exemption to be made retrospective to 1951, to regularize the exemption which has already been granted, on the assumption – now found to be erroneous – that the present law was sufficient to grant the exemption. What then, was that “present law” that was “now found to be erroneous?” The principal income tax legislation in force in 1951 was the Land and Income Tax Act 1923 108 until the legislation was consolidated and amended in 1954 in the form of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. 109 There is no evidence of any amendments to the 1923 Act between 1923 and 1951 regarding veterinary services bodies, and it was not until 1955 that a specific exemption from income tax for the VSC, veterinary clubs, and herd improvement associations, was provided in the amendment to s 86 of the principal (1954) Act in the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1955 at s 8 (1)(oo): 110 Income derived by the Veterinary Service Council established under the Veterinary Services Act 1946; and income derived by any veterinary club, society, or association, whether incorporated or not, which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting efficient veterinary services in New Zealand, if no part of the income or other 104 Subsidies to Veterinary Clubs, NZPD (11 October 1950) vol 292 at 3199. 105 Veterinary Services Council Annual Report, NZPD (18 July 1952) vol 297 at 410. 106 Land and Income Tax Act Amendment Bill, NZPD (19 October 1955) vol 307 at 3196. 107 Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill, NZPD (26 October 1955) vol 307 at 3381. 108 Land and Income Tax Act 1923 \[28 August 1923\] No 21. 109 Land and Income Tax Act 1954 \[30 September 1954\] No 67. 110 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1955 \[27 October 1955\] No 91 s 8 (1). 30 funds of the club, society, or association is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder thereof: Income derived by any herd improvement society or association ... Section 8(2) provided that the section was to apply “with respect to the tax for the year of assessment that commenced on the first day of April, nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and for every subsequent year.” 111 The proposal regarding the exemption from income tax prompted some interesting and rare debate in Parliament on the concept. In the author’s experience, little attention has been given by parliaments in common law countries to rationale for exemptions from income tax, with the exception of personal income tax concessions, particularly with respect to charities, 112 so to find at least some debate is significant in itself in understanding how such exemptions come to be. For that reason, the author has transcribed the debate in full because of its relevance both to this project and to tax history in particular. 113 The Right Hon Mr Nash (Leader of the Opposition). - Sir, there is only one point on which the Minister might give us a little more information. He has already given the major information I required. Representations have been made in regard to the exemption of veterinary clubs from income tax. I am not concerned about that if they are not profit making organizations, but if they carry on trade to make profit the profit so made would be taxable, if my memory serves me rightly. The representations I have had are that a club itself is completely exempt from tax. I would have thought that the portions of the club’s income that came from ordinary activities would be all right, provided the income was non-profit income. That is probably defined as income, but in the general run of things, you can have non- profit income, and that should be free from 111 Land and Income Tax Amendment Act, above n 36 s 8(2). 112 See MJ Gousmett, “The Charitable Purposes Exemption from Income Tax: Pitt to Pemsel 1798-1891” (2009) Unpublished Doctoral Thesis, University of Canterbury at http://hdl.handle.net/10092/3448. 113 Land and Income Tax Amendment Bill, NZPD (26 October 1955) vol 307 3383 - 3384. tax. I do not know if the representations which were made to me were also made to the Minister. The Hon Mr Watts (Minister of Finance). - I did not get those representations, although I think they have reached the Prime Minister. A Member of the Opposition also showed me a copy of a letter. The Right Hon. Mr Nash. – If the Minister knows about it he can answer the question. I would be glad to get the information so that I can clear my mind. I should like to know whether anyone engaged in trading and making a profit can be exempt from tax. Even co- operative companies are subject to tax in the ordinary way if they make a profit on their trading activities. 31 The Hon Mr Watts. – Sir, the Member for Dunedin Central showed me a copy of a letter which had been written to the Prime Minister, but which has not yet come to me in the course of business. 114 The letter contained representations from a private veterinarian, who said that the provisions of this Bill would make the position of veterinary clubs more favourable than that of private veterinarians. On the face of it I cannot see that. This veterinarian went on to say that the veterinary clubs went in for a fair amount of trading; they sold drugs, vaccines, treatments, and so on, and in that way they engaged in trading. As they did not pay tax, they put the private veterinarians at a disadvantage. The Hon Mr Skinner. – A private veterinarian does that sort of trading. The Hon Mr Watts. – Yes, but he has to pay tax on the profit he makes on the sale of vaccines and so on. First of all, the Bill provides that no shareholder or member of or a private person connected with a veterinary club shall make any profit out of the dealings of that club. If he does, then it would be taxable. Secondly, the inquiries that we have made so far lead us to believe that there is very little trading by veterinary clubs. It is so small that it is not worth doing anything about at this stage. They are not in the same position as dairy companies, which do a lot of trading. The veterinary clubs might carry some vaccines or drugs for the convenience of their members, but they sell them at cost or a little above cost. There is nothing involved in this, but between now and the next session I shall get the Department of Agriculture to make some further inquiries so that I can see whether there is anything in the representations that have been made, not so much from the point of view of protecting the private veterinarians, because I think they are rare and are in such great demand that they need no protection, but from the point of view of protecting the revenue against a growth of private trading which I do not think would be particularly desirable. We would then have a look to see whether the trading of veterinary clubs should be taxed. That is the position as I have found it. The Right Hon. Mr Nash. – If the veterinary clubs do not make a profit, even though they sell goods – The Hon. Mr Watts. – They would not be taxed. The Right Hon. Mr Nash. – They could not be. If they engage in trading on a non- profit basis they would not be subject to tax because there would be no profit to tax. The Hon. Mr Watts. – That is right. Bill read a second and a third time. 114 The Member for Dunedin Central was the Hon George Connolly (1899-1970. The author has not been able to locate the Member’s private papers, which may have contained a copy of the letter. 32 A search of the New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (NZPD) in the following Parliamentary session failed to locate any material that suggested that the question of trading by vets clubs, and whether they should be taxed, was followed up by either political party. However, the author did find a reference to the VSC (as discussed above) in that in October 1965 the Controller and Auditor-General, Mr A.D. Burns, drew the attention of the Public Expenditure Committee (PEC) to a number of matters in his report, one of those being concerns about the VSC’s financial position. 115 Burns had suggested in his report “\[t\]hat the Council had permitted its accumulated funds and reserves to increase steadily over the years and that there should be greater utilisation of reserves before further assistance was given.” 116 However, the PEC found: 117 \[t\]hat in fact the accumulated funds and reserves had not increased over the past 10 years and that since 1962 the \[VSC\] had been using reserves to supplement current revenue ... \[which\] comes jointly from funds of the producer boards and Government and it is clear that the \[VSC\] is adopting a responsible attitude towards budgeting and its use of these funds. ... There appears to be no case for criticism on the grounds used in the report of the Controller and Auditor-General and the Audit Department was unable to substantiate its criticism under examination. There are two points to note about this exchange. The first is that the ten year period referred to followed the introduction of the exemption from income tax granted to veterinary services bodies in 1955, with the second point being that no mention was made of the impact of the exemption on the funds of the VSC, even when Treasury discussed the matter of the VSC reserves with the Department of Agriculture which advised Treasury that “because of the Veterinary Services Act 1946 \[neither the Department nor Treasury\] had any control over the finances of the VSC.” 118 Reports of the Veterinary Services Council The author had expected to find reports submitted annually by the VSC to Parliament, having found a reference to such a report in the NZPD of 18 July 1952. 119 In moving that the report “be referred to the government for consideration,” the Hon Mr Skinner considered the report to be “not only of great interest, but ... also of the greatest importance to the Dominion, 115 Public Expenditure Committee (PEC), “Part II – Miscellaneous matters and matters arising out of the Controller and Auditor-General’s Report” (1966) Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives vol III Reports of Select Committees I12 at p. 14. 116 PEC, above n 115 at p. 14 117 PEC, above n 115 at p. 14 118 Report of the Controller and Auditor-General, “Veterinary Services Council” (1965) Appendix to the Journal of the House of Representatives vol 1 B.1 Part II at p. 40 119 NZPD, “Veterinary Services Council Annual Report” (18 July 1952) vol 297 at 410. 33 because we depend so much on the production of live-stock for a huge proportion of our national income.” 120 However, a thorough search of the Journals to the House of Representatives for 18 July 1952 and of the volumes of the Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives from 1946 to 1972 failed to locate any such reports. The only item that was found (as discussed above) was the reference to a matter arising out of a report by the Controller and Auditor- General to the Public Expenditure Committee concerning the utilisation by the VSC of its accumulated funds and reserves which the Council “had permitted ... to increase steadily over the years and that there should be greater utilisation of reserves before further assistance was given.” 121 The Committee was of the opinion that there was “no case for criticism \[of the VSC\] ... and the Audit Department was unable to substantiate its criticism under examination \[having failed to undertake\] an adequate in-depth investigation.” 122 The New Zealand Veterinary Association On 25 January 1952 the New Zealand Veterinary Association decided, at its Annual General Meeting, to publish its own official journal, the New Zealand Veterinary Journal (NZVJ) to provide a service to the Association’s 179 members. 123 In his Presidential Address to the Association on 12 February 1954, the President, Mr A.D.M. Laing, M.R.C.V.S., referred to the role of the Farmers’ Veterinary Clubs, describing the function of the veterinary clubs as the development “\[of\] veterinary services for farmers by veterinary surgeons.” 124 In a later letter published in the NZVJ to explain a point that Laing had made in his address concerning subsidies, Laing stated that the funding of £100,000 provided from “public and semi-public money received by the Veterinary Services Council is to be directly or indirectly used to support the veterinary club system.” 125 Laing also stated that: 126 \[t\]here is room in New Zealand for both types of clinical veterinary service, individual private practice, and farmer-controlled veterinary clubs, and for reasonable competition between them. But such competition must not be unfair through the one-sided use of public funds controlled by a body such as the Veterinary Services Council. 120 NZPD, above n 119 at 410. 121 Public Expenditure Committee (PEC), “Part II Miscellaneous matters arising out of Controller and Auditor- General’s Report – Veterinary Services Council” (1966) Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives vol III I Reports of Select Committees I. 12 at p. 14. 122 PEC, above n 121 at p. 15. 123 J.M. Filmer, “Foreword” The New Zealand Veterinary Journal (NZVJ), (1952-1953) vol 1 at 1. The New Zealand Veterinary Association was founded in 1923 – see NZVJ (1954) vol 2 at 62. 124 A.D.M.G. Laing, “The History and Development of the Veterinary Profession in New Zealand” NZVJ (1954) vol 2 iss 3 61 - 68 at 67. 125 A.D.M.G. Laing, “Correspondence” NZVJ vol 2 at 141. 126 Laing, above n 125 34 This statement predated the introduction of the exemption from income tax for veterinary services bodies in 1955. The question is, was the introduction of the concession in 1955 seen by private veterinary practices as giving an unfair advantage to the veterinary clubs? Writing in the same edition of the NZVJ in which Laing’s letter was published, a letter from a private veterinary surgeon suggests that there were such concerns in 1954, as the author of a letter, A.E.N. Egan B.V.Sc., was of the opinion that the achievements of the VSC were “made possible by sub-cost fees, levies and government subsidies.” Significantly, however, Egan stated that (emphasis added): 127 \[r\]ecently, comment was made on the taxing of the profits of these subsidized clubs and at the same time it was considered desirable that the Veterinary Services Council be empowered to increase its expenditure in continuation of its subsidies. The aspect which is most prone to criticism is the fact that the Veterinary Services Council has so exceeded its aims in the promotion of veterinary services in an unresponsive community that, in some areas, it is now subsidizing what appears to be a lucrative business; a business controlled by and for lay persons and which, in some cases, is in competition with private practice. The latter is an extremely objectionable feature and is certainly not permissible ethically. Another veterinary surgeon noted in his letter in 1955 that the VSC was “\[a\] body which subsidizes clubs which are a burden on taxation \[yet\] refuses to extend subsidies to those farmers who prefer to support private practice (emphasis added).” 128 A review of the NZVJ through to 1965 revealed little on the issue of the income tax exemption for veterinary services. In fact, the only comment was that in a letter by R. Jackson B.V.Sc, of the Lower Mataura Farmers’ Veterinary Club, in which he wrote that: 129 \[t\]he tax free \[sic\] profits from drug sales are used by some clubs to help keep visit fees at a ridiculously low level, in one case as low as 5s. A fee of 7s 6d for a bovine Caesarean section has been, and probably still is, charged by some clubs. Is it any wonder that a farmer would consider 2s 6d per animal too high a fee for tuberculin testing? Of interest, however, was the observation by M.B. Buddle B.V.Sc, D.Sc, President of the New Zealand Veterinary Association, in his Presidential Address in 1964, that: 130 127 A.N. Egan, “Correspondence” NZVJ (1954) vol 2 141 – 142 at 142. 128 Y.H.

Herd Improvement Associations What also of the herd improvement associations to which the exemption from income tax also applied? A review of the Societies Register reveals that of the ten herd improvement associations registered, only three are currently registered, with one of those being of the same name as an entity previously struck off, The Normal Herd Improvement Society Limited. 131 Interestingly, of the ten entities, five were incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and five under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1908. Only one of the three currently registered entities had ever filed its financial statements, those of The Umawera Herd Improvement Society. 132 It was with some surprise to read that the Society, in its notes to the financial statements declared that the Society, which was incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 on 14 May 2002, “meets the test for an income tax exemption as its net assessable taxable surplus is less than $1,000 per annum,” 133 especially as the Income Statement reported a net surplus of $90,654 for the year ended 31 May 2014 (2013: net deficit $43,884.) 134 The Note continued: “\[a\]s such, the \[Society\] is not subject to income tax under the Income Tax Act 2007.” 135 It would appear that the Society had applied the concession for non-profit organisations at s DV 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of $1,000 rather than the exemption from income tax provided under the Income Tax Act 2007 at s CW 51 that is available to it as a herd improvement society. What was even more intriguing to read in the Society’s rules as one of its objects was the ability to apply for a licence under the Sale of Liquor Act 1962. However, the Society did not report a bar trading account in its audited financial statements, nor did it report any associated stock on hand ... Of more concern, however, was to read the objects and then to attempt to relate the objects to the financial activities of the Society, as the objects make no mention of trading in livestock, yet that is precisely what the Society does to the exclusion of anything else in its objects, such as: 136 • Train, promote, develop, research, implement and practice farming techniques ... ; • Provide facilities for, promote, organise, regulate, hold and conduct ... research events ... ; • Promote, encourage and assist participation in training and research ... by its members ... ; • Be a member, affiliate or be associated in any other way with any other organisations with similar and/or compatible objects ... ; • Recognise, promote and support Federated Farmers of New Zealand ... ; 131 The Normal Herd Improvement Society Limited, No. 2220730 at www.societies.govt.nz. 132 The Umawera Herd Improvement Society, No. 1212035 at www.societies.govt.nz. 133 The Umawera Herd Improvement Society, above n 132 Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements Note 1(d) at p. 10. 134 The Umawera Herd Improvement Society, above n 132 Income Statement for the year ended 31 May 2014 at p. 6. 135 The Umawera Herd Improvement Society, above n 132 at p. 6. 136 The Umawera Herd Improvement Society, above n 132, Rules, Objects at Clause 3.1. 36 • Promote, encourage and assist members and supporters in the research, development, education, maintenance transportation, storage, use (or otherwise howsoever) of research projects ... ; • Establish (when appropriate), maintain and conduct Society rooms facilities and generally afford to its members and invitees the accommodation, advantages, privileges and conveniences of a Society, and to conduct such social activities ... ; • To apply for obtain and from time to time renew a Society Licence pursuant to the provisions of the Sale of Liquor Act 1962 ... ; • Generally to service the needs and requirements of members, affiliates, supporters and sponsors of Dairy Herd Improvement; • Act in good faith and loyalty to ensure the maintenance and enhancement of Dairy Herd Improvement ... ; • At all times to operate and co-operate with, and promote, mutual trust and confidence between Dairy Herd Improvement, its members, affiliates, supporters and sponsors in pursuit of these objects; • At all times to act on behalf of and in the interests of, its members, affiliates, supporters and research. While it might seem unfair to single out this Society, this does raise the issue of what the intention was behind the exemption from income tax when it was introduced, and how it is being applied in practice, at least by this particular entity. Given that the Society’s financial activities are purely trading, with no evidence of any expenditure on the items listed as the Society’s objects, is it fair, in terms of tax policy, that the income tax exemption at s CW 51 should continue to be available to the Society? Of the two remaining registered herd improvement bodies, The New Zealand Herd Improvement Society Incorporated appears to have been in financial difficulties with no financial statements filed since being incorporated on 18 May 2007, with three Property Law Notices filed by Rabobank New Zealand Limited attached to the Society’s file on the Societies Register. 137 The other, The Normal Herd Improvement Society Limited, an Industrial and Provident Society incorporated on 24 June 2014, has yet to file any financial statements. 138 An organization with an identical name was incorporated on 17 March 2009 but struck off on 17 March 2014 without any financial statements having been filed. A final comment – of the ten herd improvement entities listed on the Societies Register, the earliest date of incorporation was The Waikato Herd Improvement Society on 13 June 2001, but the Society was struck off on 17 June 2004. Given that the exemption for herd improvement societies was first granted in 1955, why were so few such bodies registered and, given the importance of the dairy industry to the New 137 The New Zealand Herd Improvement Society, No. 1944907 at www.societies.govt.nz. 138 The Normal Herd Improvement Society, No. 2607863 at www.societies.govt.nz. 37 Zealand economy, why are there so few today, with only one that appears to be financially viable but with questions concerning its activities? The Income Tax Act 2007 Today, the format and wording of the relevant section in the Income Tax Act 2007 that provides an exemption from income tax to veterinary associations, clubs and societies differs from that of 1955, as seen in s CW 50 Veterinary services bodies: 139 Exempt income: veterinary clubs (2) An amount of income derived by a veterinary association, club, or society is exempt income if – (c) the association, club, or society was established mainly to promote efficient veterinary services in New Zealand; and (d) none of its funds is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of a member, proprietor, shareholder, or associate of any of them. Exempt income: Veterinary Council An amount of income derived by the Veterinary Council of New Zealand is exempt income. The intent of s CW 50(1)(b) was broadened as part of the rewriting of the Income Tax Act 1994, which was finally completed on the passing of the Income Tax Act 2007 on 1 November 2007, by adding the term “associate” into the existing section CB 4(1)(f) on the basis that “the policy underlying \[the wording ‘proprietor, member or shareholder’\] is defeated if any person, not just a proprietor, member, or shareholder, is able to obtain a pecuniary profit.” 140 The exemption from income tax for herd improvement bodies now resides in s CW 51 Herd improvement bodies of the Income Tax Act 2007: An amount of income derived by a herd improvement association or society is exempt income if – (c) the association or society was established mainly to promote the improvement of the standard of dairy cattle in New Zealand; and 139 Income Tax Act 2007 \[1 November 2007\] No 97 (reprinted as at 1 April 2015). 140 Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1994 – Exposure Draft Part C: Income, CW Exempt Income at 220 (available at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz). Note that neither of the two issues papers that were written by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, their purpose being “to promote discussion of minor policy issues relating to policy intent or clarification of legislation that arise from the rewrite, and to seek comment from interested parties,” discussed the veterinary services exemptions. See Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, “Rewriting the Income Tax Act \[1994\]: Parts C, D, and E” (March 1998) Issues Paper 1; (June 1998) Issues Paper 2. 38 (d) none of its funds is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of a member, proprietor, shareholder, or associate of any of them. Taxation Reviews Report of the Royal Commission on Land and Income Taxation (1924) The 1924 Report of the Royal Commission on Land and Income Taxation provides a precursor to the creation in 1946 of the Veterinary Services Council over two decades later. 141 In his submission, Mr P.J. Small, President of the Dairy-farmers’ Union Incorporated (Wellington Branch), stated that: 142 \[e\]ach dairy farmer today has to be a practical veterinary surgeon to be able to live at all. He starts the beginning of the season with a good herd of cows. I know a man who paid £80 an acre for some of the richest land in New Zealand. He paid a high price for high-grade Jerseys, and his neighbour was envious of him. His neighbours thought that that was the proper way to go about dairy-farming. But at the end of the season there was only one cow left. (How is that man to pay his land tax?) Report of the Taxation Committee (Gibbs Report) (1951) While the Report of the Taxation Committee of 1951, chaired by Mr T.N. Gibbs (Gibbs Report, predated the exemption from income tax granted to veterinary service bodies in 1955, the report is enlightening from the fact of what was not discussed as much as what was. 143 While farming production was a matter that was discussed in the Gibbs Report, no reference was made to support services such as veterinary surgeons. Yet in presenting the Financial Statement for 1952 and proposed tax revisions, the value of the primary sector to the economy was acknowledged by the Prime Minister, the Hon. Mr Holland, who stated that in the previous financial year, the sector had “exported £237 million worth of goods ... It is vital to the expansion of our primary industries that they should prosper and thrive, and that the number of successful farmers on the land should increase in proportion as the total population grows.” 144 141 Report of the Royal Commission on Land and Income Taxation, (1924) Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives at B5. 142 Report, above n 141 at p. 254. 143 Report of the Taxation Committee, (1951) Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives B. Finance at B8. 144 Financial Statement, (7 August 1952) NZPD vol 297 at 795. 39 Report of the Taxation Review Committee (Ross Committee) (1967) In 1967 the Report of the Taxation Review Committee, chaired by L.N. Ross, (the Ross Committee,) in commenting on the veterinary clubs under s 86 (1)(00) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, noted that: 145 \[m\]any of these veterinary clubs carry on quite extensive business activities in the supply of stock medicines and veterinary services to members and others. They thus compete both in buying and selling markets with other forms of enterprise whose profits are subject to taxation. It is in keeping with our recommendations regarding the taxation of business profits of other exempt organisations \[ie trading charities\] that veterinary and other similar clubs and societies or associations should be subject to tax on the profits derived from trading activities. Accordingly, the Ross Committee recommended that “\[v\]eterinary clubs, societies or associations, and similar organisations which carry on trading activities should be subject to income tax in respect of such activities.” 146 However, a review of the New Zealand Parliamentary Debates following the tabling of the report in the House from 1967 through to 1970 suggests that this recommendation was not even debated, let alone implemented as a budgetary measure. Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (McCaw Report) (1982) The Report of the Tax Force on Tax Reform, 147 chaired by P.M. McCaw (McCaw Report), whose Terms of Reference required the Task Force amongst other requirements “\[t\]o undertake a thorough and systematic review of all aspects of central government,” 148 made no mention of the exemption from income tax granted to veterinary clubs. However, the Task Force did consider tax issues concerning life insurance and superannuation, building societies, co-operatives, and charitable organisations. 149 An explanation for not considering veterinary clubs may be because “\[a\] consideration of the policy objectives giving rise to concessions and incentives was not a part of \[the Task Forces’\] terms of reference.” 150 However, the Task 145 The Taxation Review Committee, “Taxation in New Zealand Report of the Taxation Review Committee” (Ross Committee) (October 1967) Wellington, R.E. Owen, Government Printer at §783. 146 Ross Committee, above n 43 at p. 323. The Ross Committee also recommended at p. 313 that “\[p\]rofits from trading derived directly or indirectly by charitable organisations and dividends derived from any company substantially owned by such organisations are assessable for income tax at normal rates.” 147 Task Force on Tax Reform, “Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform” (7 April 1982) 265 pp. The McCaw Report was the third official Report on Tax Reform post-WWII, the first being the Report of the Taxation Committee in 1951, chaired by T.N. Gibbs, which dealt only with the reform of income tax, and the second, the Ross Committee in 1967. See B.M. Niculescu, “The McCaw Report on Tax Reform” (1982) 16 New Zealand Economic Papers 28 – 40 at 31. 148 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44 (a) at (i). 149 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44 Ch 12 Special Cases at 242. 150 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44 at 7. 40 Force recognised that “\[b\]ased on information made available \[to the Task Force\], the cost of business incentives in revenue forgone is in the vicinity of $470 million per annum,” with a “strong” recommendation that those incentives “be subject to a rigorous assessment of costs and effectiveness on a regular basis,” 151 thus foreshadowing the debate on the concept of tax expenditures as seen in its recommendation of “a more explicit accounting of all concessions and incentives to improve government management procedures in this area.” 152 It was in this regard that the Task Force discussed the concept of tax expenditure budgeting, (see following discussion at “Income Tax Concessions as Tax Expenditures”) noting that in order “\[t\]o meet the fundamental objectives of government accountability and \[to achieve\] efficient and effective management, requires, as a first step, more explicit accounting of the cost of tax expenditures and their allocation (where possible) to the government’s economic and social programmes.” 153 Of significance is the observation by the Task Force that “\[b\]ecause they escape effective government control, tax expenditures seem to be more difficult to terminate.” 154 Further, the Task Force also considered that “concessions intended to act as incentives ... \[that are\] provided through the tax system \[are\] inefficient.” 155 However, in addition to those categories mentioned above, the Task Force considered that wealth taxes and trusts were also areas where there “appears to be a clear need for reform of some kind.” 156 The driver for such reforms were concerns by the Task Force “where the fairness of the system is most in question and ... the source of erosion of the acceptability of the system in the absence of reform.” 157 Finally, regarding an issue which parallels the subject of this report, i.e. the income tax exemption of commercial trading activities undertaken by charities within the same sector as income tax liable for-profit entities, the Task Force recommended that while charitable organisations should be permitted “to undertake their traditional fundraising activities, at the same time \[the government\] should minimise the scope for avoidance and reduce the advantages accruing to \[income-tax exempt\] charities which operate in competition with taxable businesses.” 158 The same argument could clearly also have been made for veterinary clubs. The question is: did for-profit veterinary practices see this as a threat in 1982, or has the issue only become more prominent in recent years? One hundred submissions were made to the Task Force, but the only farmer-focused groups to do so were the Ministry of 151 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44 at 7. 152 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44 at 7. 153 Task Force on Tax Reform, above n 44, 4.7 at 62. The creation of the term “tax expenditure” is a concept largely credited to former United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, Stanley Surrey, which the \[US\] Budget Reform Act of 1974 defined as “\[t\]hose revenue losses attributable to the provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability ... .” Stanley S.

However, some charities may engage in business activities unrelated to the charitable purpose for which they are provided a tax exemption. This exemption gives charities a competitive advantage over taxpaying business competitors. Significantly, while the committee did not specifically mention veterinary clubs, the report goes on to say that (emphasis added): 173 The committee recommends \[sic\] that the government should review the tax treatment of charities and other tax-exempt entities that engage in commercial activities unrelated to their purposes. No reason exists in principle why business income, unrelated to the core purpose, should not be taxed. The committee made reference to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) regime in the United States which is applied to trading activities undertaken by exempt organisations such as charities under § 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue code, and suggested that “\[t\]he government may wish to refer to the relevant United States legislation in designing rules for New Zealand” 174 regarding unrelated trading activities. This did not happen. However, the author considers that as well as the UBIT issue, the fact that veterinary clubs are mutual associations for the benefit of their members, if the clubs are trading with non- members, whether or not they are “commercial farmers,” is another tax policy issue that needs to be considered by the current government. Tax Review 2001 (McLeod Report) The report in October 2001 by the Tax Review Committee did not specifically discuss the issue of the taxation of veterinary clubs, 175 in spite of submissions to the contrary being raised in the June 2001 issues paper which reported that amongst “some of the other issues raised” was the taxation of “vet clubs.” 176 However, in its submission, the New Zealand Business Roundtable of the report noted that: 177 173 McKay, above n 63 at §4.17. 174 McKay, above n 63 at §4.19. 175 Rob McLeod (Chair), David Patterson, Shirley Jones, Srikanta Chatterjee, and Edward Sieper, “Tax Review 2001” (available at www.treasury.govt.nz). 176 Treasury, “Tax Review 2001 – Issues Paper” (20 June 2001) at Annex F Summary of Submissions F. 24 (available at www.treasury.govt.nz). 177 New Zealand Business Roundtable, “Submission on the Tax Review 2001” (March 2001) at 49 at http://nzinitiative.org.nz. 43 \[i\]n particular, the pattern of domestic investment is distorted by significant differences in the effective marginal tax rates applying to income from alternative investments. Those differences in effective marginal tax rates arise from: • differences in the tax treatment of different forms of income • ... • Differences in the income tax treatment of different entities (e.g. Maori Authorities, qualifying companies, mutual associations and cooperatives, and charities) ... Further, the authors noted that: 178 \[s\]ome of these differences are due to practical problems associated with the assessment and collection of tax on certain types of activities ... other differences are due to explicit decisions made by past governments to use the tax system as a means of encouraging certain ‘desirable’ activities and discouraging certain ‘undesirable’ activities. Unfortunately, it is not clear to what extent the concessional tax treatment of certain activities is due to the practical difficulties associated with taxing those activities as opposed to a deliberate decision by the government to assist or deter certain activities. ... We believe the Review has an important role to play in affirming the view that the tax system should, as far as feasible, tax all activities and classes of entities on a neutral basis. It should also identify those activities that are currently subject to concessional tax treatment and determine the extent to which those concessions arise from either explicit government policies aimed at subsidising particular activities or entities, or practical income measurement problems. As the author has found, it was an explicit government policy that the income of veterinary clubs should be exempt from income tax, on the basis that the work of the VSC, veterinary clubs and herd improvement associations, were of “national importance.” 179 However, while the farming sector continues to be of national importance, the historical basis for the tax concession to encourage the development of veterinary services has long since passed. Submission to Tax Review Committee Noting that the McLeod Tax Review Committee had recorded a reference to the issue of the income tax exemption of veterinary services bodies, the author submitted an Official Information ACT (OIA) request to Treasury for copies of submissions made to the committee. 180 This request was duly fulfilled and the author found that there was one submission with which he was provided that was directly related to the concession, a copy of which is appended to this report as a separate document. The submitter, whose name has been withheld by Treasury, in noting that “\[o\]ver many years numerous vets (sic) have written 178 New Zealand Business Roundtable, above n 68 at 49. 179 See above n 33. 180 The author wishes to record with appreciation the assistance accorded to him by Treasury officials in responding to his request for copies of submissions made to the McLeod tax review committee. 44 on this matter to MPs, Ministers of Revenue and the Inland Revenue Department without success,” also made a number of pertinent observations. 181 In particular, the submitter stated that: 182 • The original reasons for establishing a subsidised veterinary service have long since disappeared; • The farming industry has adapted to the removal of subsidies in a competitive economic environment \[s\]o why should the business of providing veterinary services by vet clubs be exempt from income tax under any circumstances in 2001? • This tax exemption is an anachronism and an inequity that should be removed from the tax legislation; • Some \[vet\] club practices have accumulated enormous assets, have turnovers of many millions of dollars and have become monopolies; • Their existence ... provides an unfair tax advantage; • Vet clubs have an obvious commercial advantage over private practices; • There is no logical reason for \[vet clubs\] to be exempt \[from income tax\]. Tax and Charities (2001) While the 2001 report “Tax and Charities” focussed specifically on the non-profit sector (although it could be argued that vet clubs are also “non-profit,” at least in theory), nevertheless there were some interesting comments made concerning the income tax exemption, trading by charities, and tax policy. 183 While the issue of competitive advantage was raised, the final price of products was competitive with for-profits, therefore pricing was not the issue. 184 The issue, it was suggested, was the competitive advantage a charity could gain through the ability to accumulate tax-free profits thus enabling “a faster accumulation of funds \[which would allow it\] to expand more rapidly than its competitors.” 185 This was “the real competitive advantage that trading activities owned by charities have over their competitors.” 186 On that basis the Discussion Paper proposed that “\[t\]rading operations owned by charities would be subject to tax in the same way as other businesses, but with an 181 \[Anonymous\], “Submission on income tax exemptions \[S\]ection 61 (28),” Private submission to the Tax Review Committee, 21 February 2001 provided to the author. On 26 October 2015 the author wrote to the Minister of Revenue and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue requesting copies of such correspondence, and also any subsequent correspondence on this matter as well as replies to the correspondence received. At the time of completing this report shortly afterwards, no response had been received by the author. 182 \[Anonymous\], above n 181. 183 Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Department. “Tax and Charities – A government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies” (June 2001) at www.ird.govt.nz. 184 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.2 – §9.5. 185 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.6. 186 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.6. 45 unlimited deduction for distributions made to relevant charitable purposes.” 187 Ultimately it was not until 2007 when the new concessions for charitable giving by donors, companies and Maori Authorities were adopted by the removal of the caps on donations and deductions. 188 However, the issue of taxing the trading activities of charities was not pursued further by the government. OECD Working Party on Agricultural Polices and Markets (2005) According to the OECD, the income tax exemptions provided to veterinary clubs and herd improvement societies have had their day: 189 185. Tax revenue from the agriculture sector \[in New Zealand\] is an important component of government revenue. ... ... 189. Exempt income of veterinary clubs and herd improvement societies \[s CB 4(f)-(g)\]. These exemptions are historical. In the farming context they are not of any significance. The main advantage lies with the ability of these bodies to effectively re-invest their total profits in the provision of necessary infrastructure (buildings, equipment, vehicles, etc). Interest on borrowings for such infrastructure, and associate costs of depreciation and repair/maintenance are not tax deductible. The concession is effectively one of allowing these activities to grow at a faster speed (due to the ability to reinvest all net profits earned rather than net profits after tax). There is no distortion in investments decisions as a result of this measure, as the exemption applies to all income earned from the club or society. Over time, these exemptions are likely to be withdrawn. It is interesting to note also the recent report by the OECD on the taxation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) with one of the key findings being that “\[t\]he heterogeneity of the SME population means careful targeting is required to ensure that any government interventions, including tax preferences, achieve their stated policy objectives,” with careful targeting required to ensure that distortions are reduced. 190 The OECD also noted that “\[e\]xemptions may be temporary in nature, designed to ease the burden of the tax system in the first year of existence.” 191 187 Tax and Charities, above n 70 at §9.7. 188 See Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 (19 December 2007) No 109. 189 OECD Directorate for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Committee for Agriculture, Working Party on Agricultural Policies and Markets, “Non-sectoral Policies for the Agriculture and Agri-food Sectors: Taxation and Social Security” (4 August 2005) AGR/CA/APM (2004) 13/Final (available at www.oecd.org). 190 OECD, “Taxation of SMEs in OECD and G20 Countries,” (2015) OECD Tax Policy Studies, No 23, OECD Publishing (Paris), at 14. 191 OECD, above n 190, at 73. 46 Non-profit Institutions Satellite Account: 2004 In 2007 Statistics New Zealand released the first in-depth study of the non-profit sector in New Zealand, “Non-profit Institutions Satellite Account. 192 This study was inspired by a series of similar international studies led by the Centre for Civil Society Studies, Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore. The purpose of a satellite account is to “\[rearrange\] existing information in the national accounts so that an area of particular economic or social importance ... can be analysed more closely.” 193 What is of interest is to find that “veterinary clubs” were classified as a community-based organisations, alongside A & P societies, as being “in scope” for the purposes of the study while licensing trusts, also classed as community organisations, were not in scope; 194 “veterinary services” were classified under the subgroup “animal protection.” 195 Apart from a statement that “\[i\]t is important to note that the environment group is financially dominated by the Animal Health Board and farmers’ veterinary cooperatives,” and that “\[m\]uch of the contribution to GDP comes from the large employing \[environment\] non- profit institutions, including national and international environmental institutions, the Animal Health Board, and farmers’ veterinary cooperatives,” with “\[t\]he primary source of income \[being\] the sale of goods and services \[at $125 million or 78% of environment total income\], such as veterinary services to farmers,” there is nothing specifically in the report about the contribution of veterinary clubs per se. 196 The different language that was used in the Statistics New Zealand report, such as veterinary club, veterinary cooperatives, veterinary services, and in another report associated with the study, veterinary associations, 197 suggests some confusion about the activities of these entities, given that they are not mutually inclusive. With the NFP study due to be replicated in New Zealand in the near future, this point should be made when reviewing which institutions are to be in scope for the purposes of the study, particularity when some veterinary clubs are clearly based on the for-profit model. Income Tax Concessions as Tax Expenditures Each year at Budget time, the government issues a Tax Expenditure Statement, the purpose of the statement being “to provide additional transparency around policy-motivated ‘expenditures’ made through the tax system.” 198 The first such statement was produced in 1984 and included the exemption from income tax provided to veterinary clubs and herd 192 Statistics New Zealand, “Non-profit Institutions Satellite Account: 2004” (2007) Statistics New Zealand, Wellington. 193 Statistics New Zealand, above n 192 at 1. 194 Statistics New Zealand, above n 192 at 7. 195 Statistics New Zealand, above n 192 at 111. 196 Statistics New Zealand, above n 192 at 59. 197 Margaret Tennant, Jackie Sanders, Michael O’Brien and Charlotte Castle, “Defining the Nonprofit Sector: New Zealand” (2006) Working Papers of The Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project at 22 (available at www.philanthropy.org.nz.) 198 Treasury, “2015 Tax Expenditure Statement” (21 May 2015) at www.treasury.govt.nz. 47 improvement societies, with the general objective being “\[t\]o encourage these organisations,” but it was not possible to provide an estimate of the cost due to there being “\[i\]nsufficient information available on which to base an estimate.” 199 The 2015 Tax Expenditure Statement was the sixth successive release of tax expenditure data, with 2010 being the first time that New Zealand had released tax expenditure data since 1984. 200 Treasury defines tax expenditures as “\[taking\] the form of an exemption, allowance, preferential tax rate, deferral or offset that reduce a tax obligation to achieve a specific policy objective.” 201 The basis for disclosing tax expenditures is because they are tax provisions that are “significantly motivated” by “non-revenue policy objective\[s\].” 202 Some, such as deductions and tax credits for charitable or other public benefit gifts, are quantifiable. For example, the forecast value of the tax expenditure for 2014/2015 for donations claimed as deductions by companies is $14 million, and for tax credits for private donations, $236 million. 203 Not all tax expenditures are reported in this way, as while the Tax Expenditure Statement lists the tax expenditures that are included in the Income Tax Act 2007, not all are quantifiable. 204 This list includes Veterinary Services Bodies exempt income (s CW 50), as an uncosted “permanent” “business” expenditure, 205 as well as Herd Improvement Bodies exempt income (s CW 51), also as a “permanent” “business” expenditure. 206 Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) Certain entities are eligible for an exemption from income tax on interest earned on bank deposits and dividend income under section 32E of the Tax Administration Act 1994, 207 including Veterinary Services Bodies and Herd Improvement Bodies. 208 Note that this is not a certificate for the exemption from income tax on net surpluses, as in this case the certificate only applies to interest on bank funds and dividend income. At a rate of 28% this exemption alone provides eligible organisations with a further cash advantage in addition to the exemption from income tax on net surpluses and on dividend income. The RWT was introduced in 1989 in order to “counter the substantial evasion and deferral of tax on interest and dividends that have been reported for several years, notably in the report of the McCaw task force on tax reform ... . ...

Case Law There is no case law of significance to the subject matter of this report. The only case directly related to a veterinary club that the author was able to identify was Ashburton Veterinary Club (Inc.) v Hopkins in Christchurch in 1960. 210 This case concerned a dispute over a contract between the veterinary club and a veterinarian employed by the club, the issue of the “assigned area” in which he was required to work and a restraint of trade clause should he resign. Further, as an incorporated society, the Court held that the society “was not precluded from making gains unless the gains are distributed among members. It may, therefore, as the proprietor of any ordinary business may do, protect itself against unreasonable competition on the part of a former employee,” and an injunction was issued to restrain the defendant from practicing as a veterinary surgeon for a period of one year from 10 September 1959. There is, however, an interesting parallel with the subject matter of this report, concerning unfair competition through the effects of the exemption from income tax on private veterinary practices which would be interesting to explore in a tax court setting. It is this issue to which this report now turns by way of a financial analysis of five veterinary clubs. 210 Ashburton Veterinary Club (Inc.) v Hopkins \[1960\] NZLR 564. 49 Part B Case Studies Part B of the research paper discusses a number of case studies to illustrate how the income tax exemption is being applied contrary to Parliaments intent in 1955, and the resulting benefit of the income tax exemption to commercialised veterinary clubs. Te Awamutu Veterinary Association Incorporated The Te Awamutu Veterinary Association Incorporated (the Association) was incorporated on 9 March 1943 as a registered incorporated society. 211 The original rules by which the Association was incorporated are no longer available on the Societies Register, with the latest set being filed on 16 April 2008. 212 The Rules describe the objects of the Association as being to: 213 4.1 provide for members, and at the discretion of the Board and on such terms and conditions as the Board from time to time determines for non- members, a cost effective veterinary service, 4.2 employ qualified veterinary surgeons and other necessary staff to provide that veterinary service, 4.3 purchase, prepare, dispense and sell livestock remedies, medicines and supplies, 4.4 promote by the dissemination of information, holding of seminars or otherwise the instruction of members in livestock management, diseases, treatment, breeding, care and improvement, 4.5 purchase, exchange, take on lease or let real or personal property for the purposes of the Association and to borrow or raise money for any of the purposes of the Association and charge or mortgage any of its assets, and 4.6 apply the income of the Association solely towards the promotion and furtherance of these objects but so that except as provided at Rule 17 no portion of the Association’s funds is to be paid directly or indirectly by way of bonus, dividend or otherwise to any member. 211 Te Awamutu Veterinary Association, Number 214303 at www.societies.govt.nz. 212 Rules of the Te Awamutu Veterinary Association (16 April 2008). Note that the Rules were sworn at Te Awamutu on 5 November 2003. 213 Rules, above n 212 at Clause 4 Objects. 50 Further, the Rules provided that membership was available “to bona fide farmers conducting commercial farming operations,” 214 with a provision for associate members who “may receive such benefits or services as the Board from time to time authorises and may be present and speak at General Meetings but may not vote or stand for office.” 215 As an incorporated society is only required to file financial information with the Societies Registrar, and not an annual report on the activities undertaken by the society, it is difficult to ascertain whether a society is complying with its constitution based on the financial information that is filed. With respect to the Te Awamutu Veterinary Association, the financial information that has to date been filed clearly provides details of trading activities in accordance with clauses 4.1 to 4.3 above, but there is no evidence on the record of activities undertaken with respect to Clause 4.4 above. However, what is of interest from a ten year analysis from 2004 to 2013 of the financial information are increases in: 216 • rebates to sales from $6.6 million (2.93%) to $13.5 million (5.39%); • gross profit to gross income from $1.5 million (23.3%) to $4 million (29.9%); • net profit to total income from $120,780 (3.9%) to $369,095 (5.0%). • net assets from $2.7 million to $6.7 million. Of particular interest is the effect on the Association’s funds through the income tax concession, as the benefit derived by the Association from that concession from 2004 to 2013 alone, when the de facto income tax is calculated, equates to $1.2 million with $0.8 million of that amount having accrued since 2009. Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated The Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated was incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 on 22 August 1944. 217 The latest version of the Constitution of the Club, dated 29 November 2005, states that “\[t\]he primary object of the Society \[sic\] is to provide efficient large animal veterinary services to members” (emphasis added). 218 The Constitution also states that “\[t\]he further objects of the Society are”: 219 3.2.1 To provide efficient veterinary service for non-members provided that the provision of such a service is not detrimental to the interest of members. 214 Rules, above n 212 at Clause 5 Membership and Admission, Sub-clause 5.1. 215 Rules, above n 212 at Clause 5 Membership and Admission, Sub-clause 5.6. 216 Te Awamutu Veterinary Association, Financial Statements, above n 211. 217 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, Number 214317 at www.societies.govt.nz. 218 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217 at Clause 3.1. 219 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217 at Clause 3.2. 51 3.2.2 To employ the services of qualified veterinarians. 3.2.3 To retail to members and non-members, stock remedies, stock medicines, drugs, veterinary equipment and associated materials and any other classes of goods approved by the Board from time to time. 3.2.4 To promote and hold lectures, field days and demonstrations, and similar functions and activities for the purposes of instructing members and others in the treatment and care of their animals and in the utilisation of land for that purpose. 3.2.5 To establish and maintain clinics and animal hospitals in the district for use by the Society. 3.2.6 To provide scholarships, grants or other benefits for the purposes of encouraging and assisting persons in the pursuit of careers in large animal veterinary medicine. The Notes to the financial statements declare that “\[t\]he Club \[sic\] is exempt from income tax by virtue of section CW 50 of the Income Tax Act 2007.” 220 There is nothing in the financial statements for the years 2009 to 2014 that suggest that anything other than commercial activities are undertaken by the Society, or Club. For example, the chairman reported in 2011 (emphasis added): 221 The Club was very aware of the recessionary climate last year and \[the CEO\] has made the most of the upgrade of the Animal Hospital in Rotorua and Fonterra’s record payout. This, along with an increase in market share, has delivered a positive result and allowed the Club to further invest in the delivery of service to you, the members. ... The 2011 result is a tribute to all the veterinary teams (large and small animals) vet nurses ... . The CEO also made an interesting comment in his report, stating that “\[h\]owever, it is our diversification in servicing all animal species, employment of a motivated enthusiastic team of veterinary staff plus attention to being price competitive and minimising costs which have all contributed to our positive year end result.” 222 The CEO also noted the “Club’s achievement in growing market share in the rural dairy sector. ... Remaining cost effective without compromising service is the priority for The Vet Club team.” 223 220 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2009, Statement of Accounting Policies. 221 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Report of the Chairman 2011 at 2. 222 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Report of the CEO 2011 at 3. 223 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Report of the CEO 2011 at 3. 52 The CEO also stated in his report that during the year he had “presented the 4 th year veterinary students at Massey University the advantages of working for vet clubs over private clinical practice which was very well received. Vet clubs remain unique as profit is not the main driver for the business.” 224 Apart from a passing reference to “continued education,” the financial statements for 2011 do not report any expenditure on its objects with respect to field days, lectures, and other means of instruction delivered to its members, as the financial statements report only on the Society’s trading and administrative functions. Director’s fees for 2011 were $43,992 (2010: $35,415), 225 but no information is provided regarding “Other Expenses” of $606,836. 226 The financial statements for 2012 and 2013 are equally as uninformative on the non-trading activities of the Society. However, what can be extracted from the financial statements for the five years from 2009 to 2013 is that the de facto income tax on the Society’s net surpluses would amount to $437,667, an average before de facto tax return of 11.1% and an after de facto tax of 7.9% with peaks of 18.4%:12.9% in 2010 and 17.6%:12.7% in 2013. The author argues that this concession provides a significant fiscal advantage to the Society in that the income tax forgone by the government is an indirect subsidy of the activities of the commercial trading activities of the Society, with the concession allowing the accumulation of funds towards the $1.5 million refurbishment of the Society’s Rotorua clinic. 227 A comment by the chair also demonstrates how far the Society has moved from its founding constitution in that: 228 because the Club constitution allows only those with a number of production animals to be members and obtain member benefits, the majority of its small animal clients have missed out on these benefits. By providing NZVZ Best Practice Hospital facilities at small town pricing, all our clients will benefit. These comments by the chair of a veterinary club are a clear indication that the rationale behind the creation of the veterinary clubs in the first place, that is, to support the development of New Zealand’s economy in the post WWII years, and of the rationale for the exemption from income tax as being in the national interest, have been forgotten by both the commercialised vet clubs and the government resulting in an unfair competitive advantage to those commercialised vet clubs in the 21 st century. Further, as a society, there is an income tax concession under the Income Tax Act 2007 in section DV 8 which provides for “a deduction for the lesser of $1,000 and the amount that would have been the organisations net income in the absence of this section.” 229 However, on the basis of the mutuality principle, “trading within the circle of membership” is a non-taxable activity (with the exception of the 224 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Report of the CEO at 5. 225 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Notes to the Accounts 2011 at Note 4. 226 Rotorua District Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 217, Statement of Financial Performance 2011 at 9. 227 Vet Profile, above n 79 at 15. 228 Vet Profile, above n 79 at 15. 229 Income Tax Act 2007, s DV8 Non-profit organisations at s DV8 (2). 53 sale of trading stock or the provision of services) with the requirement that trading by a society with non-members that can be readily accounted for is a taxable activity. It seems that these provisions are being over-ridden by the income tax exemption for veterinary services as provided in section CW 50 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Private veterinary practices have been seen as a potential threat to the financial viability of the veterinary clubs for some time, as can be seen on The Vet Club Rotorua’s website where the timeline for 1957 recorded that “\[t\]wo enquiries have been made by private practices to open their own businesses. The Vet Club may have to stay open on Saturday mornings to stay profitable.” 230 Anexa FVC Anexa FVC is a merger between Anexa Animal Health and Farmers’ Vet Club (FVC Veterinary Services,) with the intention of the Board of the new entity being “to ensure \[that\] strong competition remains in the market ... as a farmer-led veterinary practice ... adding value to their member’s farming enterprises.” 231 The Farmers’ Vet Club, trading as FVC Veterinary Services Incorporated, was established in Ngatea in 1923 232 and the Morrinsville Vet Club which, according to Anexa, was founded in 1939. 233 FVC Veterinary Services was placed into liquidation on 20 May 2015. 234 While the author has been unable to find any record of the Morrinsville Veterinary Club on the Societies Register, an article in the New Zealand Herald throws some light on the club. 235 The Morrinsville Veterinary Club was formed in December 1938 with the following recommendations made by the committee (emphasis added): 236 The veterinary officer to confine his services to club members; The annual subscription to be on the basis of £2 10s for 50 cows per shed, and £3 10s for over 50 cows; That 400 members be the minimum for the club; That information be obtained as to the amount being spent in New Zealand in combating disease in stock and a comparison made with the amount spent on similar work in other countries. 230 The Vet Club Rotorua, “Timeline” at www.thevetclub.co.nz. 231 Anexa Animal Health, “Vet Club Merger Confirmed” (2 June 2015) at www.anexa.co.nz. 232 Companies Office, FVC Veterinary Services Incorporated, 214117 at www.societies.govt.nz. 233 Anexa Animal Health, above n 231.

The club also advertised itself as: Morrinsville District Veterinary Club (Inc.) (New Zealand Herald 14 April 1945 at 12); and Morrinsville District Veterinary Association (Inc.) (New Zealand Herald 7 March 1942 at 2). 236 Correspondent, above n 235. 54 Rangiora Vet Centre Limited The Rangiora Vet Centre Limited 237 is wholly owned by Vetlife Limited which was originally incorporated under the Companies Act 1995 as South Canterbury Veterinary Services Limited. 238 The relationship of Vetlife to the veterinary club movement is explained on Vetlife’s website: “\[a\]lthough Vetlife is now one of the largest veterinary organisations\[s\] in the South Island \[with 16 clinics\], it essentially is the combination of three vet clubs and a private practice, with a forward looking vision.” 239 Vetlife explains that the “underlying entity is the South Canterbury Vet Club which was established in the early 1950s.” 240 There is no such entity on the Societies Register, but a closer examination of the records of the South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club, which was incorporated as a society in 1950, 241 reveals that the financial statements for the society in 2013 were under the name South Canterbury Veterinary Club (Inc)., but in 2014 the financial statements were headed South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Cub (Inc.), with the Notes to the Financial Statements explaining that “\[t\]hese financial statements are of South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club (Inc.). \[The society\] is engaged in the business of property rental.” 242 According to a notification filed with the Registrar of Societies in 2006, the name of the society was changed from “South Canterbury Veterinary Club” to “South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club Incorporated.” 243 With rental income in 2014 of $92,950 and no income tax paid, and unsecured advances of $1,159,308 to Veterinary Properties Limited, of which the South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club Incorporated is the sole shareholder, 244 what is the nature of the income tax exempt entity to Vetlife? Do these companies argue that because the shareholder has income tax exempt status that also colour those companies commercial activities with that fiscal privilege, as in the charity sector in New Zealand? Vetlife Ashburton 245 was originally the Ashburton Veterinary Club Incorporated, which was incorporated as a society in 1950. 246 The last set of financial statements filed by the society was in 1999 but the financial statements have been archived and are no longer available to the public, with the society having been struck off in 2001. 247 Presumably the income tax exemption for the society also died at that point. 237 Companies Office, Rangiora Vet Centre Limited, Registered No. 1925207 at www.business.govt.nz. 238 Companies Office, Vetlife Limited, Registered No. 133282 at www.business.govt.nz. 239 Vetlife, “Who we are,” at http://vetlife.co.nz. 240 Vetlife, above n 239. 241 South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club, Registration No. 219583 at www.societies.govt.nz. 242 South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club Inc., Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2014 at Note 1. 243 South & Mid Canterbury Veterinary Club, above n 241. 244 Veterinary Properties Limited, Registration No. 1902013 at www.business.govt.nz. 245 Vetlife, above n 239. 246 Ashburton Veterinary Club Incorporated, No. 219568 at www.societies.govt.nz. 247 Ashburton Veterinary Club Incorporated, above n 246. 55 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club Incorporated A recent edition of The Akaroa Mail carried an advertisement for the forthcoming AGM of the Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Vet Club, 248 which was incorporated in 1950. 249 The 2014 financial statements of the club state that “the nature of the society’s business is leasing plant and buildings to VetLife Ltd (previously known as South & Mid Canterbury Vet Service Ltd) to continue on \[sic\] providing veterinary services in the Banks Peninsula District.” 250 The club’s income for 2014 of $18,747 consisted of membership fees of $2,580, interested received of $9,167 and rent of $7,000. Administration expenses of $7,616 included insurance of $1,794, rates of $2,289 and building repairs and maintenance of $1,063. The gross rent received of $7,000 indicates a return of 4.2% on the carrying value of land and buildings of $168,493. However, after taking rates, insurance and depreciation on the land and buildings into account at a total $10,601, the club made a loss of $3,600 which suggests that the income tax exemption enjoyed by the club allows it to rent its property to VetLife at a discount to the market. There is no evidence of any direct veterinary activity by the club at all. This suggests that the club is today a landlord, which is able to offer reduced rents to a commercial operator as a consequence of the club’s exemption from income tax, yet the primary object of the club as stated in its Rules of 1950 is “\[t\]o provide a veterinary service in that part of Bans Peninsula East of the Rabbit Fence for members of the Society and for that purpose to retain the services of a duly qualified veterinary surgeon or surgeons.” 251 There is no evidence of the performance of other objects as described in the clubs Rules, such as trading in medicines, drugs, or veterinary equipment, 252 holding lectures, field-days or demonstrations, 253 or establishing and maintaining a laboratory. 254 The question then is, to what extent is this occurring throughout New Zealand by other vet clubs, unnoticed by IRD and the Government? 248 \[Classified Advertisements,\] The Akaroa Mail (11 September 2015) at 19. 249 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, No. 219587 at www.societies.govt.nz. 250 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, above n 249, Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2014, Note 2. 251 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, above n 249, Rules, Objects at Clause 2(a). 252 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, above n 249, Rules, Objects at Clause 2(c). 253 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, above n 249, Rules, Objects at Clause 2(d). 254 The Banks Peninsula Farmers’ Veterinary Club, above n 249, Rules, Objects at Clause 2(e). 56 Part C Conclusions and Recommendations While the income tax exemption granted to veterinary services bodies in 1955 was done so with a particular economic policy in mind, sixty years later the concession is being used in a manner that would not have been contemplated by Parliament in that the concession is being applied to commercial trading activities by veterinary services bodies thereby providing them with a distinct competitive advantage over their for-profit competitors through the retention of funds that allows a faster rate of growth that would otherwise be possible if those funds were applied to income tax liabilities. As a submitter to the 2001 Tax Review Committee stated, the concession is indeed an anachronism that should be removed from New Zealand’s income tax legislation. In 2005 the OECD also noted its inappropriateness and that in due course it was likely that it would be removed, yet ten years later the concession remains. The author respectfully recommends that the government revisit the fiscal concession with a view to amending the Income Tax Act 2007 such that only bona-fide non-profit veterinary services bodies be able to apply the concession to their benefit and that the commercial trading activities now undertaken by veterinary services bodies be liable to income tax in order to level the playing field in terms of tax equity. Neither is it acceptable that because a shareholder, being a veterinary services body, has income tax exempt status therefore the concession can also be applied to the commercial activities of the related company. Further, the issue of the use of the RWT concession that is also available to veterinary services bodies which are engaged in commercial trading activities also needs to be addressed by the government. In order that all affected parties may exercise their democratic right to be heard, this amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 should be considered through the Select Committee process. If adopted by the House, provision should also be made to allow affected entities an opportunity to reorganise their financial positions to accommodate their new income tax liabilities. It is not recommended that such an amendment should be back-dated.

Submission to tax working group April 2018 From: Mary Hamilton, Preamble ● The tax system needs to raise sufficient revenue to carry out properly the collective purposes of society and should embody its values ● In this country both the short and long term welfare and wellbeing of its people are the prime goals of society. ● A main impediment to this well being is the steadily growing gap between rich and poor. This gap is associated with a variety of negative outcomes for both poor and rich (The Spirit Level); therefore it is reasonable for the reduction of this gap to be a prime goal of the tax system. ● This is not the same thing as treating ‘the economy’ as the goal, which can result in a thriving economy, an exploited workforce and rundown basic services. ● I am not suggesting that all the ideas I give below should be implemented. Others will know how much each tax can generate. Also how much each with cost to administrate. It also seems important that a tax system not have too many sections to it. The overall theme is sufficient taxes to pay for the complete government programme, significantly redistribute income and encourage people to change certain behaviours. Some suggestions to close the gap between rich and poor: ● More steeply progressive income tax. For instance $0 - 15,000 -- 0% or an even higher threshold if feasible -- rising in steps to %40 at $150, and %45 or %50 over $1million (cf top tax band in Denmark 55.8% and %54 in France) \[1\] \[1\] Having an even higher tax threshold might enable such things as accommodation allowances to be scrapped and thus both simplify the system and perhaps even help lower rental rates. The current tax system seems to encourage property investment as tax advantaged relative to other forms of investment, as interest payments can be counted as a business expense and so tax deductible. Perhaps property needs to be reclassified so this cannot happen. Property investors have not gone into productive business ●Capital Gains Tax. Need to exempt the family home. ●Wealth Tax This could be assessed annually. Perhaps tax free under $1 million, 0.5% over $1 million 1% over $2 million 5% over $5 million Need to exclude land officially designated as a carbon sink, QEII covenant or similar. Hopefully this would encourage the formation of more carbon sinks. At every step need to consider the effect of taxation on our goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, in addition to the effect on the poorest 10-20% of the population. Could consider excluding land used for organic farming. This in turn would mean less nitrate use and lower stocking rates. Closing loopholes: a wealth tax must be at a higher rate than Family Trust Tax. This latter might therefore need raising. ●Financial Transaction Tax of $0.001% over $1,000. This could be considered. How much revenue would it raise? ●Empty homes tax. This could be assessed ot 1% of a residential property’s assessed rateable value on property empty for more than 4 months per year Either this would raise some revenue or it might help a little to reduce house prices. ●Cut gst from 15% to 10% as it is a regressive tax. However, investigate all practical ways to include items bought from international websites so that our own businesses are not disadvantaged. Other taxes: nearly all of these are taxes on products that generate large negative externalities. ●Health taxes, for instance tobacco, sugar, alcohol. The purpose is to encourage health and wellbeing and also to pay some of multiple health costs these items cause. ●Carbon taxes. These need to be considered with the group working out the practical methods of reaching carbon zero by 2050 ●Plastic bag tax. Aim to discourage use and rate perhaps 20 cents each. ●Tourist Tax. A flat $50. This is low enough not to discourage much travel. ●Multinational tax avoiders operating in New Zealand. I have no suggestions as to how except to investigate the issue as it seems to be a loophole in need of closing.

For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submissions to the Tax Working group I have chosen to comment on the following matters- Capital Gains Tax(CGT) There are problems with both accrued and realised methods of calculating capital gain. Accrual has a relative advantage of early and steady revenue flow, but it loses revenue when there is capital loss. Neither method should be used; instead a designed for purpose capital valuation database and management system(db+ms) would be a better solution. The objective of a db+ms system would be to provide valuations, for CGT use only, which smooth out transient +ve and -ve spikes in valuations. I suggest a db+ms with two parts. First, a current valuation database that updated as frequently as possible. Other valutions would be updated as necessary to yield a complete database that is as current and accurate as possible; for land based property this could be developed from the LINZ valuation database. Second, capital gains tax valuations would be derived by calcuation from the modified LINZ database. The derived valuation would reflect database values and trends and possibly other inputs, eg land zone or legislation change, effect of interest rate change, natural disaster, etc. The db+ms would calculate the CGT valuation when required by each tax client's account cycle. A property owner might wish to object to their CGT valuation. However, since a CGT valuation would be a derived value which does not entirely reflect market valuation, the grounds for objection would be limited. Using this database and management system would apply db+ms valuations at the date of introduction of CGT; CG revenue would start during the second year. This system should be running 6-12 months before CGT begins in order to pre-test it. Since these valuations would be conservative there could/would be an adjustment if realised sale value was higher than the applied CGT valuation at sale date. And, since most CGT will be paid prior to death or separation causing a sale, the cost to IRD of making exemptions in these cases will be less. Also, the CGT impact of a person selling one business to buy another would be reduced. A variant of this system might be applicable to shares. Using this managed database system would see the business income adjusted by adding capital gain or, rarely, subtracting capital loss. It is a method of factoring a likely future capital gain into the income during each of the years the asset is held. If the property business is running at a loss, and those losses are offset against other income, then CG income adjustment should apply. If the losses are ring-fenced then CG income adjustment should be caried forward. IRD may need flexibility here as there will be cases of genuine hardship. If the property was being held primarily for capital gain and not earning income then the CG should be taxed; it is not the function of a tax system to facilitate valuable assets being left idle. Other observations on CGT Taxing capital gain would likely be integral with deducting capital loss from taxable income if CGT is introduced. However, property prices are currently at a high level and it is possible some properties may fall in value. There is a similar risk with shares. It is not the responsibility of other taxpayers to buffer these capital losses. Therefore there is no great urgency to introduce a CGT. If inflation is taken into account then it could be argued that a property holding a steady dollar value is actually losing real value; such real loss to be calculated and offset against income. Reducing taxable capital gain or other income by means of inflation accounting is equaly ridiculous. Makes about as much sense as adjusting the GST rate for inflation. A CGT will need many exemptions- family home, charities, iwi, genuine hardship, separation and death. A realised CGT will be avoidable by not selling a property( eg iwi, family, entity) or by merging with the entity which owns the property, ie no sale is made but is effectively owned by a different person/entity. Some may defer the decision to sell. From the point of view of house tenants(the majority of house occupiers) it would seem that the family home being exempt from CGT is unnecessary and unfair. This should be considered as an argument against CGT; the tenant will effectively be paying some of his landlord's CGT while the owner occupier pays nothing. It would be better if the effect of CGT on tenants is monitored- a website/database could be set up which tenants could use/log in to get information and advice, report rent hikes or termination, or contact an advisor or case manager. The same site could be used for business tenants. IRD might gain some value from such a website/database by linking tenant/property/owner/entity. The downstream results of a CGT should be monitored and analysed to allow rule modification which contributes to fairness. The greatest value of a CGT is to use it in conjunction with income tax rules and not as a stand alone tax. Introducing new CGT rules in this way is, I believe, less alarming for tax payers who own property. The Black Economies The cash economy presents a challenge. Banknote counting machines with serial number recognition already exist, some with online capability. Electronically tracking banknotes and implementing a database would give some leads in tracking down tax evasion. General knowledge that such a system exists would provide further deterrent to tax evasion. Data could be collected at ATMs, bank teller deposits/ withdrawals, overseas remittances paid in cash, overseas transactions using NZ banknotes, and all cash transactions above a given value. Business would pass on the cost to their users, the IRD would still need to analyse note tracking data. Public reaction to these measures might be tempered by the realisation that these types of measures are predictable because of constant advances in technology. The use of hidden systems or crptocurrency to disguise cash movements and hide income is an increasing problem. Verifiable tax accounts are unlikely to be provided by users of these hidden systems. The weakness in using such a system is at the two points of money in and money out. Funds paid from or paid to the accounts of hidden system users could be treated as consumption and income respectively, and taxed accordingly. The difficulty is cash entering such hidden systems, which is where bank note tracking may yield its greatest return. In this case the cost and information would, no doubt, be willingly shared by many agencies and government departments internationally as well as in New Zealand. Opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion are still plentiful. There may be merit in going back to compulsory annual returns for all taxpayers, especially with online capability. The annual legal declaration that correct and complete information was given to the IRD is compelling. Maintaining a broad tax base Tax should be spread as widely as possible to keep tax rates as low as possible. Consumption tax No new exemptions to GST should be made. Keep it simple to apply so that GST returns are straightforward. There is also the following reason to keep GST as it is now: Any overseas company selling goods and services to New Zealand based buyers is operating in New Zealand. If considering GST, where they operate is a more relevant factor than where they operate from. New Zealand buyers are consuming product which, if bought in New Zealand, would be subject to GST; most overseas sellers are not obliged to charge GST on their NZ sales under a certain value. The logical step with overseas purchases is to report the GST payable to IRD, at the time of purchase, for direct payment of GST to IRD. It would require online purchaseres to have a tax id number and a debitable account. Neither seller nor fund transfer service need add the GST. The cost to IRD of setting this system up would be offset by the advantage of immediate collection of GST on overseas puchases. Income tax Under employment law an employment relationship is clearly defined. And this should also be the case under income tax rules. The IRD could operate a system which analyses all employee/contractor/etc cases to ensure income tax and ACC levies are not being avoided by employer or employee, ie looking at the employer/employee or employer/comtractor as a pair to check on overall compliance. Lost income and company tax- overseas based operators Many transnational companies pay little tax. There are two reasons why this is likely to continue: First, as tax authorities belatedly corner transnational operators to pay more tax so those operators will develop incresingly serpentine measures to slip away from their obligations. Second, it may be optimistic to factor full co-operation between various tax authorities in extracting tax from transnational operators; if one nation's tax authority considers it is already receiving enough revenue it might opt out of tax treaty negotiations. It may be necessary for the IRD to confront operators with a persistant tax avoidance/evasion habit by applying a levy on their NZ sales. Call it a transnational evasion prevention tax. It would at least improve the IRD's negotiating position with the transnational and refresh negotiations with other tax authorities. Private overseas money transfers With globalisation and the internet there has been a considerable increase in private money remittances and payments to overseas based recipients. These transactions are a loss of liquidity to New Zealand's internal economy; a loss of consumption spending and consequent downstream employment. Thus GST, company and income tax are foregone. This is a narrowing of our tax base that puts extra load on other taxpayers. A transaction tax on private overseas remittances and purchases might be a justifiable form of lost tax recovery. Regarding fairness I see tax fairness as avoiding undesirable human outcomes. An example is the tax treatment of investment in existing houses for use as rental properties; it has contributed to low and reducing percentage of owner occupiers, increasing house and rent prices, and capital wastage. More people now rent than own; a portion of society has become transient, including schoolchildren. The effects were predictable and observable but little effective action was taken; eg tax rules to make new house building more attractive than investment in existing houses never happened. The Policy and Strategy Group within the IRD needs to make predicting and monitoring the effects of tax policy a priority so that bad outcomes are avoided. Data collection and analytical software, plus the will to act, will be essential. Yours faithfully Paul Glover

TAX REVIEW SUBMISSION APRIL 2018 – PRUE HYMAN INTRODUCTION - This submission comes from Prue Hyman, formerly Associate Professor of Economics and Gender and Women’s Studies at Victoria University of Wellington and is informed by my academic background and my own perspectives. I do not claim to be an expert in taxation but I am more informed than if I did not have this background. I consider that the terms of reference for this review are disappointingly narrow, excluding some elements of great importance for tax policy. Even more important, taxation cannot be seen apart from the government expenditure it helps make possible. For individuals and households, it is the impact of tax and transfer systems together which affect their outcome in terms of standards of living. The calculations done by the Living Wage movement to assess the necessary gross hourly wage to allow a minimum decent standard of living recognises this. In addition, other elements of government economic and social policy which affect income distribution before taxes are paid and transfers received are the context within which taxation policy should be seen. I will mention these briefly as they are crucial, even though they are beyond the control of the current exercise. Levels of income inequality have increased alarmingly in NZ over the last 40 years (particularly during the mid 1980s to 1990s) and levels of relative poverty are depressingly large. Tax policy can modify these to some extent through progressive taxation but many other policy areas have contributed to this – for example industrial relations policies which have deregulated the labour market, and resulted in lower levels of unionisation and collective bargaining. The resulting wider earnings differentials which contribute to overall income inequality are one result of this. In my view policies are necessary to reverse all this – but if this does not occur, what is required is far more steeply progressive income taxes, together with one or more of wealth/capital gains/gift/ inheritance taxes. In addition the ability to evade income tax and particularly company tax needs to be investigated and as far as possible eliminated. The corporate sector’s ability to evade taxation with local and international arrangements and sleight of hand has been exposed by many researchers and commentators and needs to be tackled with much more tenacity than yet applied in New Zealand. Lower income individuals, households, families and groups are insufficiently protected in the current economic and social climate. Women and Maori and other minority ethnic groups are overrepresented in lower income households and analysis concentrating on outcomes for these groups is essential. I note that gender issues are nowhere mentioned in the Background Paper for this exercise, while Maori issues are discussed only superficially. The ways in which the tax system, as well as other elements of the economic and social framework, is insufficiently geared to reducing inequalities and protecting those on lower incomes, has major adverse impacts on women overall, as they are heavily overrepresented in such low income groups. While the Tax Working Group cannot solve, or even consider in detail, all these linked issues, I consider it should in its report draw attention to these wider concerns. Without more examination of them, tax policies can only tinker at the edges of the issues. ADDRESSING SOME OF THE WORKING GROUP’S FIVE KEY QUESTIONS - WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF TAX?/ ARE WE TAXING THE RIGHT THINGS?  - There is nothing wrong with the Working Group’s own criteria for taxation systems: efficiency; equity and fairness, through ‘horizontal equity’ and ‘vertical equity’; revenue integrity; fiscal adequacy; minimizing compliance and administration costs; coherence. The problems arise when attempting to operationalize these and reconcile different views on them. There is also a problem with the context, particularly in terms of fiscal adequacy. The Working Group appears to accept as a given “the Government’s fiscal objective for the tax system is to support a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).” Further it goes on to accept the over-tight Budget Responsibility Rules by saying: “If the Government is to continue providing healthcare and superannuation at current levels, then the level of taxation will need to increase, or spending on other transfers or publicly provided goods and services will need to fall” (p 10). At least that seems to envisage an increase beyond 30% of GDP for tax and government expenditure with which I would certainly agree. I argue that given the very urgent needs of the education and health system including increasing wages and salaries of the large largely female lower earning workforce at the bottom of both systems, such an increase is essential. While I could nominate some areas where government expenditure could decrease, that would certainly not include transfers. A balanced budget is also not essential, especially given the run down nature of many areas of government spending under recent governments. Given critical infrastructure needs as well as vital social spending, even a prudent government (which should not for political reasons put the prudential nature of policy too high) can afford to run relatively small deficits and borrow to meet them. As argued above, vertical equity requires a far more steeply progressive income tax system than applies at present. With GST being a regressive tax, it is essential that income tax restores the balance towards equity. This is given weight by the inequality statistics in MSD’s Household Incomes reports – quoted in the WG Background Paper as follows: “The inequality-reducing power of the tax and transfer system on market income inequality has steadily declined for New Zealand from 27% to 17% over the last three decades (using the Gini)... The inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax- benefit system is currently relatively low compared with that for other OECD countries, including those who (like New Zealand) have lower unemployment rates (for example, Germany, Norway, the UK and Australia). It is below the OECD average.” One other element of taxation which is important and can be seen as falling under efficiency – avoiding distortion in the use of resources – is discouraging activity with negative externalities and other bad impacts on individuals and society. This is one of the most important justifications of excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco. How high these should be raised is open to much debate – both in terms of the revenue raised (which will be affected by the elasticities of demand for the products) and what is reasonable. Environmental taxes are also critical in terms of allocation of resources with much economic activity contributing to negative climate change. Governments should not be afraid of imposing new taxes which are well justified in this category. A case can be made for less taxation on positive activities, work and the income from it, and more on income and assets which do not result from or constitute current positive activity – including interest, land, and polluting activities. Another activity which could well be taxed is that of financial transactions. The making of money si mply by exchange of financial instruments with no real productive or worthwhile activity is widespread, at national and international levels. It is high time that a Tobin tax (or financial transactions tax was introduced). Even at a very low level, it could both deter some of these unproductive activities and raise useful revenue from those that continue. In particular NZ is one of very few developed countries which has no comprehensive capital gains tax, nor a wealth, gift or inheritance tax. The Working Groups needs to grasp the nettle in this area, despite its political difficulty. There may well, for example, be strong views in favour of parents being able to pass on their assets to their children. However, wealthy households will already have had the ability to enhance the educational and other opportunities of their children to a greater extent than others. Perhaps it is time to question the lack of an inheritance tax. There is considerable evidence internationally (Piketty and others have written extensively on this) that wealth distribution has widened greatly in the last fifty years. Increasing inequality in income and wealth has undesirable social effects which are also costly in economic terms. It is time to tackle and reverse this. One possible option which the Working Group should consider is that from the Opportunities Party - their proposal is in essence to deem a minimum rate of return on all productive assets, including housing and land. Those that already declare at least that level of income will be unaffected. Those that do not do so would have income imputed and pay an increased level of tax. As long as lower income groups are protected by not increasing the total impact of all taxation on these groups, business and those on higher incomes and with considerable wealth should be able to make a larger contribution. GENDER ISSUES - I noted above that gender issues are nowhere mentioned in the WG’s Background Paper, which is unfortunate given the fact that women have lower earnings and incomes on average than men and therefore need consideration of the tax/transfer systems to assess gender impacts of any suggested changes. The tax system is rightly based on the individual unit in most respects, unlike the transfer system, which is largely couple and family/household based. There have been proposals for many decades for individualising the transfer system (from the Royal Commission on Social Policy onwards) – from starting by making some benefits, such as the injury benefit, not dependent on couple income through to universal basic income proposals. This is beyond the current exercise. However, it is important for the Working Group to recognise the greater amount of household, caring and voluntary work done by women compared to men and the lesser amount and lower average pay of paid work which makes women’s economic independence less on average than that of men. Because of this, transfer payments (such as sole parent benefits) and some elements of government expenditure are of even more importance to women on average than to men. Hence the balanced budget, 30% maximum proportion of government activity to GDP can disadvantage women. There is a double issue from minimizing the total tax take: if taxes are cut, women’s lower average incomes mean that they receive smaller tax reductions, while they are affected more if public services deteriorate as the result of insufficient revenue and hence expenditure. Gender analysis of policy proposals was taken relatively seriously in New Zealand from the 1980s with encouragement from the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, but recently has had less impact. From 2002 to 2008, there was a requirement for such analysis to be applied to papers submitted to government’s Social Equity Cabinet Committee. Key questions to guide methodology for gender analysis were included in the Cabinet Office Circular. They were derived from the Ministry for Women’s Affairs publication ‘The Full Picture - Guidelines for Gender Analysis’ (1996). However, the analysis was rarely done well. It is time for a revival of this practice and for it to be done better. In this connection it is good to see that the Treasury is now taking seriously feminist and other critiques of GDP as a measure of welfare and is developing its Living Standards Framework which will attempt to measure four types of capital - natural, social, human, and financial/physical capital. However, there has been little mention in this exercise of distribution of income and resources, gender issues or the problems with market valuation. The more market approach of the last decades has contributed to the widening inequality and poverty crises. Gender budgeting, which relates closely to gender analysis, has been undertaken in a number of countries and has recently been put on the agenda in New Zealand. A recent Treasury paper, ‘Gender Budgeting: A Useful Approach for Aotearoa New Zealand’, Suzy Morrissey, New Zealand Treasury Working Paper 18/02, April 2018, is a modest start towards a revival of gender analysis. Earnings inequalities particularly affect women who are overrepresented in low paid work. This is relevant to taxation structures and policies in a number of ways. In particular the squeeze on health and education spending means that allocations to Health Boards and schools are insufficient to pay adequate wages and salaries, particularly to lower status employees. Hence pay levels for nurses and care workers, teacher aides and other support workers, all predominantly female workforces, are lower than their productivity and skills justify. Equal pay for work of equal value policies to remedy the undervaluation of such female dominated work have been implemented at only a glacial pace. The Bartlett v Terranova case under the Equal Pay Act led eventually to a settlement for aged care workers, but it is essential that budgetary provision is made for settlements in a number of other areas under negotiation. CONCLUSION – The proposals and analyses suggested above would go a considerable way to improving equity in the NZ tax system. It is beyond my time and expertise to make more detailed proposals but I have been privileged to read a draft of the CTU submissions to the Working Group, and these seem to me to be well researched and to overlap considerably with my views expressed here. I comment that submission to you.

Submission to the Future of Tax – Submissions Background Paper From: Paul and Ann Jarman Email: Address: If there is an opportunity to present our submission in Christchurch we would like to speak to the working group. This submission is made by Paul and Ann Jarman. We own a 400 hectare farm near Darfield in Selwyn, Canterbury. We milk 750 cows plus replacements, 500 super fine merinos +replacements and grow 50 Ha of crops. The farm was established by Paul’s great-great grandfather in the early 1860s and has been owned by the family for over 150 years. We installed irrigation in the 1980s, and 8 staff work on our farm. We have a strong commitment to improving the environmental management of our farm. We were was lucky to receive the Gilbert scholarship which allowed him to visit England and study environmental management systems operating on farms there. We have also received 4 special awards in the Ballance Farm Environment Award Competition. Paul has always read, attended field days and worked with consultants to ensure the farm uses the best evidence based practices to farm profitably and in harmony with the environment. A LAND TAX We have significant concerns about the impact a land tax could have on our property and on other farmers across New Zealand. We already effectively pay a land tax because most of our local body rates are based directly or indirectly on the farms land area. Given that over 80% of New Zealand’s taxable land area is in the ownership of farmers, along with urban business owners, farmers are one of the main groups being targeted to pay a land tax. The amount of the land tax to be raised is unclear but as we own a reasonably large farm of over 400 hectares we would assume this would be in excess of $20,000 or $30,000 every year for our property. We note that in the discussion paper a land tax is described as an efficient tax because land is in fixed supply. We assume it is seen as efficient as the tax would encourage land to move to the highest value uses. While a landowner in the city can convert their land to a higher income generating activity, we are told that land use intensification is the cause of many of the farm generated environmental issues eg to maximise return on the dairy platform we should carry over 4 cows per ha. However, a more environmentally prudent approach \[led by the Lincoln Dairy Unit\] is to reduce cow numbers closer to 3.5 per ha. Should we pay for these extra costs by selling land to lifestyle blocks and thus taking it out of productive farming use? The government has rightly pointed to the national consequences of 35,000 \[1\] \[1\] ha pa being lost to productive farming. Under regional Environment Canterbury planning rules there are also restrictions on how we can use our farm. In fact, we are willingly working with Ecan to reduce any nutrient management issues caused by intensive farming. We have embraced techniques like direct drilling to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and will be no doubt be investing more into animal breeding and stock feed as part of our attention to changing our carbon profile. A land tax does not create an incentive to shift to higher value generating activities for farmers. Our incomes are limited by the very fluctuating international market, investing in best environmental practices is costly in time and money. We already pay a land tax through the local government rating system and their 10 year plans look as if those rates are going to increase significantly more than the CPI. On a limited budget we cannot pay for everything. Most of the planning rules are in place because Councils recognise that farming is a significant source of income for the country, and because they want to protect productive land. They are also in place because urban New Zealanders and tourists enjoy looking at world leading agriculture beside undeveloped natural landscape. They don’t come to see cities or industrial areas. These rules restrict how farmers can use their land, and also provide a benefit to our economy, to the tourism industry and to New Zealanders who recognise the New Zealand landscape as both our parks and beaches but also our countryside farming land. Imposing a land tax on farmers while having very restrictive rules on how our land is used which are designed to benefit all New Zealanders is unfair. We cannot switch to other land uses and because of this we have a limited ability to pay a new land tax. We note that in Europe where there are such restrictions on land use, farmers are usually paid for their care of the land! A WATER TAX We calculated that at 2 cents per 1,000 litres of water we would pay around $30,000 every year in a water tax for our farm. We first installed irrigation on our farm in the 1980s. At that time government policy was to encourage farmers to develop irrigation as MAF advisors promoted the benefits it provided. Since then we have expanded our irrigation system which is currently sourced from groundwater. As cropping farmers, irrigation provides certainty that we would be able to meet contract requirements around crop yield and quality which suppliers specified. The requirement for irrigation is driven not just from farmers, but from suppliers, supermarkets and consumers who want a regular supply of food. They purchase and sell what we produce by the tonne not by the Ha we plant so they will only usually enter into contracts with irrigated farms. We also have a small flock of merino sheep on the farm. Irrigation has helped ensure that we know that we can feed sheep if needed and this is beneficial for animal health and welfare. We currently have 800 cows on the farm and irrigation is necessary to supplement rainfall and grow grass. We are shareholders in Central Plains Water (CPW) and will start using the water when stage 2 of the scheme opens this spring. The scheme was initiated by Selwyn District Council and Christchurch City to protect the aquifers of Canterbury, as well as to enhance the economy of Selwyn and Christchurch by expanding the use of irrigation to generate more employment and income. On a financial level committing to CPW did not make sense, as water from the scheme is significantly more expensive than sourcing our water from groundwater. However we, like our fellow farmers signed up to an intergenerational investment in our community, one that is committed to the health of our aquifers and that gives us resilience to the challenges of climate change. The farmers who signed up to the scheme are not international businesses, we are family owned businesses. In investing in CPW we are already paying an environmental water tax as the water we now use is significantly more expensive. Through shifting many farms from using groundwater to alpine water, aquifers will be allowed to recharge. This will benefit other water users in Selwyn as well as groundwater fed streams such as the Selwyn River. The environmental requirements CPW must meet under its consent rules are very high and every farm is responsible for meeting these rules. We have been clearly told that if we breach any of the environmental requirements we will have our water shut off, creating a very strong incentive for everyone to follow best practice all of the time. Many other farmers who draw water from irrigation schemes also have additional environmental requirements in place at a scheme level, which other farmers or water users do not have. A water tax will make schemes like Central Plains Water, which have desirable environmental outcomes, less viable by making the cost of water more expensive. Water quality across New Zealand We note that many water quality issues like nitrogen, phosphorus and poor macroinvertebrate health affect both regions with significant irrigated land area and regions with little irrigation. We also note that, according to the Ministry for the Environment, the regions with the least swimmable rivers are all located in regions with little irrigation – Auckland (62% of rivers graded poor for swimming), Northland (48% of rivers graded poor for swimming), Waikato (44% of rivers graded poor for swimming), and Southland (29% of rivers graded poor for swimming). Around 60% of New Zealand’s irrigated land is located in Canterbury (which has 4% of rivers graded poor for swimming), with Otago (9% of rivers graded poor), Hawkes Bay (2% of rivers graded poor) and Marlborough (1% of rivers graded poor), also having significant areas of irrigated land. We would question why it is reasonable or fair that a small group of farmers using irrigation in east coast regions where swimmability is good should fund the cost of cleaning up waterways in other regions with poor water quality. This is not how an environmental tax should work. An environmental tax should penalise those who are polluting and tax them so that they change their behaviour. But a water tax would allow regions with poor water quality to do nothing to change behaviour while having the cost of cleaning up their waterways subsidised by a small group of irrigating farmers from other regions. A water tax removes money to make environmental improvements and invest in water efficiency We plan to install additional centre pivots and switch from using an older rotor rainer irrigator to all centre pivots. Centre pivots are the most efficient irrigation system available. Imposing a water tax would mean that we will not be able to invest in more water efficient irrigation systems and it will have the same effect on other farmers. Under Environment Canterbury rules we will have to reduce nitrogen leaching on our farm by 30% by 2022. Other dairy farmers in our district have to meet the same requirements. We will be looking at a variety of ways to do this – through new crop types or research. This may reduce our income level as we trial crops that reduce leaching but have an impact on milk production. Imposing a water tax at the same time as we are trying to find ways to reduce our environmental impact seems unreasonable. We are currently replanting our property in mixed natives to create a corridor to attract native birds. A water tax would reduce the amount of money we have available to do this, and we would likely not proceed with this project. Like most other Canterbury farmers we are proud of our farm environment plans which have an expectation that we will be lifting our environmental performance and reducing our impact over time, meaning that we are operating in an environment where the bar is continually being lifted. HIGHER FUEL TAX We note there is a proposal by the government to raise fuel tax across New Zealand primarily to fund public transport projects. Fuel taxes are paid disproportionally by rural New Zealanders as we have to travel further to access services. Electric cars are not really an option when you travel significant distances. We have no public transport services near our property we can access and have no choice but to use cars or trucks. As there are no plans to develop public transport to our area, while we would pay more for petrol, we would not benefit from this additional charge. CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF TAXES When we start to add up the impact a land tax, water tax and additional fuel tax could have on our farm, we could be looking at an additional $50,000 - $100,000 per year in taxes for our farm. We invest most of our farm income in debt repayment to repay the costs of belonging to Central Plains Water. These additional taxes would be a challenge and the easy solution would be to sell or to be minimally compliant. That’s not our way. Rural NZ wants to pay its way. We don’t live in a wealthy suburb. Our children attend a school where children from all sectors of our community. We pay taxes to support those amongst us who need it. We also understand that by living in the country we have poorer access to all health and welfare services. WE also have jobs that demand 12-14 hour days every day of the year. We do more than our share for our people and environment and are quite angry at how farmers are often portrayed using inaccurate slogans I am pleased that you are asking for our input into this important debate. Remember for taxes to be successful they must be simple, fair and easy to implement. That means significant research. The plans we are following to improve water quality, carbon and nutrient management are not the result of a simple media slogan, they came from a generation of hard, inclusive discussion based on sound science. I expect nothing less from your tax working group. Thank you for considering this submission from ordinary New Zealand farmers
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group 2018. Preamble. The Tax Working Group’s background paper is comprehensive and clear. Over the last sixty years we have seen a big increase in the number of citizens with disproportionate wealth. In the past, a smaller wealthy group gained assets for a variety of reasons, many of which were contributory to societal improvements. With recent expansion of the population and pressure on land the potential for wealth accumulation from property speculation and property development has increased. With larger businesses and globalisation, managerial and administrative groups have had significant increases in remuneration. There may have been increased pressure for businesses to maximise profit for shareholders. In industries where professional groups have international mobility, remuneration has been increased to retain qualified staff. All these changes have contributed to a redistribution of wealth. New Zealand has a proud record of producing individuals who have striven for excellence, coped with challenges and difficulties and have contributed positively to our own society and those overseas. This outcome was fostered by a well organised, comprehensive education system which at least for some years brought children from different backgrounds together. With the growth of our larger cities, suburbs have become more uneven in their economic status. This has led to some rupture in the cohesiveness of our society. If we wish to return towards a more egalitarian and cohesive society then changes that help the less privileged to improve their economic status are needed. Ch. 2 Future Environment Risks. Evasion of tax by multi-national companies could continue. Internet companies could continue to sit outside the taxation regime. Technological progress could lead to damaging unemployment. Increased unemployment could lead to downward pressure on wages. Imposition of a fair tax liability could lead some enterprises to exit New Zealand. Higher costs for business in New Zealand could reduce competitiveness overseas leading to lower sales, profits and tax-take. The ageing population will lead to greater pressure on those who are productive. Challenges. To change the perception of tax as an impost to recognition of its social benefit. To develop a taxation regime which contributes to fair distribution of wealth. To broaden the taxation base so that change in the age structure of the population will not lead to an excessive burden on the work-force. To minimise the possibility of personal profit from community investments in infrastructure. Opportunities. To reduce the proportion of taxation derived from work and production and increase taxation of consumption and income from the use of community assets. To foster re-education programmes for work as needs and opportunities arise. To encourage investment in production, research and development. To develop mechanisms for the payment of fair contributions by multinational and internet companies. To support climate change initiatives. Ch. 3 Fairness has largely been discussed on the imposition or input side in the background document. Whilst these ethical aspects must be considered, more emphasis on outcomes or outputs might be helpful. For example: Changes which lead to a more egalitarian outcome would be fair. Changes that reduce the possibility of personal profit from community assets would be fair. Changes that reduce avoidance by multinational and internet companies would be fair. Ch. 4 A broad-based low rate system has support. Re-introduction of a land tax would be helpful: It would increase the broad base of taxation It should have few exceptions (like gst) The difficulties for some could be managed: Those on low income - lowest quintile - perhaps no income tax 2nd lowest quintile – reduced income tax Elderly (high capital, low income) - low cost reverse mortgages. Ch. 5 A land tax would reduce the unearned profit by individuals from either speculation in land or increases in land value due to infrastructure improvements or increase in population. CH. 6 The main inconsistencies are: 1. The ability to aggregate wealth through investment and speculation in land. A land tax would minimise this. 2. The ability of internet and multinational companies to avoid tax. This will require a targeted approach. Ch. 7 Land Tax Introduction of Land Tax on the unimproved value of land would add a further broad-based element. Individual owners would then contribute to the State in proportion to their occupation of its finite land resource. It would be relatively simple to introduce, administrative costs would be low, and it would be an influence to curb excessive inflation of land values. Its collection would not have the delay associated with capital gains tax and this would have an equilibrating effect. It could not be avoided or evaded, and this includes non-resident owners or multi-national businesses. It may have a greater impact on the less affluent, like gst, and the lowest quintiles of income may need income tax reduction. Some individuals may need social welfare support at first, but lower income groups would benefit in the long term. In line with the analysis of Popper in relation to new legislation, it should be introduced gradually. The tax should be introduced at a low rate. The effects of this should be analysed for benefits and unforeseen consequences. The tax could then either be reduced or increased. With this approach there is likely to be better community buy-in and less likelihood of reversal by future governments. The issue of landowners being faced with a one-off fall in the value of their property would be mitigated by commencement at a low rate with the possibility of later increases. Allowance of this tax as a business deduction would weaken the broad base and lead to attempted reclassification of some properties. The Terms of Reference for the Working Group have excluded consideration of the family home. As a possible outcome of tax reform is reduction in the wealth gap, universal application of land tax would help as its impact would be progressive. Although the lower quintiles may initially consider land tax on their home a threat, the possibility of other tax relief could more than compensate. It would be helpful if the Working Group was able to make a comparative analysis of the effects of a land tax on all properties compared to one excluding family homes. Housing. In relation to housing, the inhibiting effect of high capital value would be decreased by a land tax. There could be an increase in rental charges, but theoretically this might be offset in the long-term by the other tax implications for lower income groups. Capital Gains Tax. This might be deferred until the effects of a land tax have been assessed. The 2009 analysis by Inland Revenue suggested a capital gains tax was likely to reduce rather than increase economic efficiency and increase administration and compliance costs. G.S.T. exemptions. GST arrangements should remain unchanged. Reduction in income tax for the lower quintiles, and appropriate benefits for the needy are probably more effective ways of targeting individuals and families for whom increased indirect taxation leads to difficulty. Environmental taxes. There is currently an incentive for the uptake of electric cars. Since diesel exhausts are the more troublesome automotive source of pollution it could be useful if a tax on their use in cities was applied. The use of finite resources is an issue. There appears to have been an over-commitment of water to dairy farming on marginal land. This has often entailed heavy use of electricity for irrigation. The cost of increased generation and line capacities to meet this may well have increased the cost of electricity for everyone. This may be an issue for consideration.

Submission to the Tax Working Group Richard Brent 29 April 2018 Brief Summary of major points • Tax relief for retirement savings. • Tax relief for businesses and employees moving out of Auckland to regions. • More user pays for use of DOC facilities. • Tax relief for people saving for 1 st home. • No land tax • Modification to Bright Line Capital gains tax to further reduce speculative activity Questions for Submitters Chapter 2: The Future environment And Chapter 3: Purposes of and principals of a good tax system Both of these questions are related, and also part of the wider question of how the taxes collected are spent. This is outside the scope of this review. In the near to medium future the tax system will have to cope with an increased proportion of the population being past retirement age. This has been predictable from birth statistics, so should not be the cause of any great surprise. Assessing the effectiveness of a tax system and defining fairness are totally subjective. While most people accept a need for taxes to pay for infrastructure, beyond that opinions will vary. There is an understandable preference for people to be happy for taxes to be levied on other people. For example, people who own a second property are generally not in favour of a capital gains tax, whereas people who do not own a second property, and in particular those who are owner occupiers in Auckland are more than happy for a capital gains tax with themselves excluded. People on lower or no income are quite happy with the progressive nature of the income tax system, whereas people on relatively modest incomes paying the top tax rate, are not so happy. Again, all tax payers probably have preferences on how their tax should be spent. Should private or public enterprises provide services? These questions are outside the scope of this review, but nevertheless have an impact on how people might respond to it. Chapter 4 the current New Zealand Tax System Frameworks The current tax system is fit for purpose, and apart from a bit of tweaking here and there, it does not need any dramatic change. Taxes and behaviour Taxes can be used to promote desirable behaviours. However, the revenue raised from such taxes should be carefully targeted towards mitigating the behaviour they are designed to alter, as the ideal outcome is that they would reduce to zero as they achieve their purpose. For example, if there was no income from tobacco tax, because nobody smoked any more, that would be the most desirable outcome. There are more comments on this addressed in the specific challenges section. Retirement savings The tax system should give every encouragement for people to save for and if possible become self-sufficient in retirement. The contributions into KiwiSaver should have further tax relief. There would also be advantages in making KiwiSaver compulsory. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance The tax system has moved towards addressing this balance in part with the capital gains tax on property if sold within two years of purchase and recently increased to 5 years. See specific challenges and design of a capital gains system for more comment on this. The productive economy is a difficult one to define. As stated, productive vs speculative suggests the productive economy is defined as people who pay income tax. However, not all income earning activities are productive, for example overly complex and poorly drafted tax law creates an industry of tax accountants and lawyers who arguably are not as productive as workers on a building site. An ongoing issue of unfairness, is that the level at which each tax rate starts under a progressive income tax system comes down with inflation. Those levels should be indexed against inflation. With the massive inflation of the 1970s and 80s, people on relatively modest incomes ended up paying the top tax rate. Tax and business Filing tax returns and all the record keeping that accompanies it is a cost to business. The simpler the tax system the lower the cost to business. It is preferable if taxable transactions are electronically filed with IRD so that the business does not have to manually file the same transaction. This appears to be progressively implemented between IRD and businesses already. I am not familiar with businesses profiting from excessive deductions and/or timing of deductions and/or non-taxable income, so no comment. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system There are inconsistencies in the current tax system, but these contribute to rather than reduce the fairness of the system. Taxes are levied by governments to pay for things deemed necessary by society. However, where the benefits of a service are only enjoyed by a select few, it may be more appropriate for a user pays regime which is not normally considered as a tax. The example mentioned in the background paper are the use of DOC huts. Tourism has reached a point where there has to be a user pays regime to pay in part for the facilities which are so desperately needed. Tolls charged for entrance to National Parks and DOC walks, might not be considered as taxes, but would help target users to pay for the facilities they use rather than the general taxpayer. Chapter 7: Specific Challenges Housing affordability The median house price to median wage ratio is clearly too high. In Auckland wages would have to rise at 3% per annum and house prices would have to remain static for 36 years for this ratio to reduce from 8.8 down to 3. In Christchurch with a current ratio of 5.4 it would take nearly 20 years. To correct this situation in a shorter timeframe, either house prices have to fall, or wages have to rise (significantly). House Prices There are two components here, land price and building cost. The land price component can be reduced by making more land available. This can be achieved by: • Zone changes, that is, creating zones where high density housing replaced existing low density housing. • Expanding onto rural land. Both of these solutions are the responsibility of local authorities rather that central government and re zoning is difficult politically and expanding brings with it ever increasing infrastructure costs. The tax system could be used to encourage people and businesses into places with cheaper housing and land. By world standards New Zealand is unusual in that Auckland is approximately the same size as the next 6 largest metropolitan population areas added together. This migration to Auckland is economically inefficient for the strain it puts the rest of New Zealand to pay for Auckland infrastructure while there are underutilised resources elsewhere. The other part of the equation is median income. The tax system cannot raise wages directly but could give tax breaks for people saving for their first home. KiwiSaver already has the provision for use as a 1 st home deposit, but the contributions are still fully taxed. The tax could be reduced even to zero for a ring fenced 1 st home deposit savings fund. Other tax initiatives to improve housing affordability Because land is in limited supply particularly in large metropolitan areas prices can be artificially pushed up by speculative activity. A paper by Burman and White written in 2009 includes data from the Statistic New Zealand Survey of Family Income and Employment (SoFIE) dated 2004. Of all the household assets which would be likely to experience capital gains over time, property (including owner occupied housing) make up 70% of all assets held. This is made up of 56% owner occupied properties and 14% investment properties. The further breakdown of investment properties, speculative, rental, private use, is not given. The next section on capital gains tax discusses the characteristics of these categories further. Short term speculation is likely to put upward pressure on housing prices, and especially if properties are purchased by overseas investors (with more money at their disposal) for this purpose. The Capital Gains tax on properties held for less than 5 years should reduce this type of activity, although different weightings could be used to eliminate it almost completely. See Appendix for a suggested Capital Gains tax design. Capital gains tax We already have a capital gains tax which taxes capitals gains as income if a property (other than the family home) is sold within 5 years of purchase. This is a start. Capital gains are not income in the normal sense, as the gains, when realised, are not regular or reliable income, and while the past few years have shown strong gains, during the 10 years following the 1987 share market crash the property market was going backwards or stagnant at best. The other difference is that if capital gains are taxed with no time limit, tax payers would have to keep records for an unreasonably long time, and it would be difficult to verify the accuracy of such records. For example, parts of a house might be upgraded more than once, so that any evidence of a previous upgrade would be destroyed. Properties, other than the family home, could be broken into three categories: 1. Those purchased for speculative purposes. Properties in this category are likely to be held for a short period, and the owner will tend to buy and sell reasonably often. The other distinguishing characteristic is that they are likely to be highly geared. 2. Those purchased as income generating rental properties. Properties in this category will require the filing of tax returns for rental activity, so are easy to identify. These properties tend to be held for longer periods of time. A test of whether a rental property is intended to generate revenue could be determined from the amount of interest claimed. If it is highly geared, it will generate little taxable net income. If there is a record of the owner reducing the mortgage, it is more likely to be an income generating asset rather than an asset held for capital gains. It should be possible to devise a test based on the amount of interest claimed as an expense, to determine the difference. It should be noted that rental properties are part of the housing mix, so care has to be taken not to make changes which push up rents unnecessarily. 3. Those purchased for occasional use by the owners, that is the family bach. This category is often properties which are held for very long periods, and often stay in a family for several generations. The Bright Line test is designed to tax the speculators who probably have the biggest impact on housing affordability. This could be tweaked a little, and I have documented my ideas in the appendix to this submission. Land tax Of the categories above a land tax would hit bach owners, but would be legitimately passed on to tenants for rental properties. Speculators generally keep properties for short periods and so would not be greatly affected. It comes into the same category as rates and would raise revenue and be easy to administer. However, it is a form of double taxation, and as such it cannot really be seen as a fair tax. It is not that local authorities aren’t already taxing land as much as they can get away with. Environmental taxation This is a difficult topic given that there are a lot of complex interrelationships in the economy. For example, dairy farming is responsible for much of our green-house gas emissions. We could tax some part of the process which would inevitably lead to higher prices for dairy products. This tax component of dairy products could be seen as the same as the tax on tobacco products. Do we really want to treat those the same? In the end such taxes are regressive, as it is only lower income families which suffer. In short, the tax system is probably not suitable for fixing our environmental problems. Other government policies and regulations are better placed to deal with environmental problems. Progressive company tax This would seem reasonable, although large companies are often structured as one holding company with lots of business units which are separate companies. This could enable large companies to become a lot of small companies for tax purposes, although there are probably ways of preventing this. Small businesses would benefit from any simplification of the tax system, as compliance can be a significant cost. GST exemption for particular goods There is already GST exemption on a few transactions such as rents which are a distinct service and financial transactions which are apparently too hard to manage, but also quite distinct. Extending exemptions to goods has problems of definition. Exempting GST on “healthy food” for example immediately raises the question of what is the definition of healthy? Back in the days of sales tax, there were the same items used by different industries which attracted different sales taxes. An example was a printer used in the printing industry attracted a sales tax of 10 % whereas in the computer industry it attracted 40 %! The system was complex and inefficient. While varying GST rates might appear to have some merits, it would may open a can of worms in implementation and interpretation. At the moment it is simple and efficient. Appendix Design of a capital gains tax If you think that the Group should design a capital gains tax (CGT) for Government consideration, we need your feedback now on a number of detailed design issues Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of income tax. In order to dampen the component of rising house prices due to speculation I believe there should be some form of CGT on land with or without houses on that land. CGT should be separate from income tax as this allows more flexibility to target property prices increases specifically and the speculators who profit from these rises. It would be a dangerous to see such a tax to use for revenue gathering, as it would depend on speculative activity, and would effectively reward a government for failing to control property prices. Ideally, the tax take would be low with property prices being roughly in line with general inflation. Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets at death be treated? CGT should be collected on disposal not an accrual basis, as this would require ongoing valuations which are always hit and miss whereas the value at disposal is concrete. Matrimonial investment property should be taxed for capital gains if it meets that taxable criteria. An issue arises which would need to be clarified. If one partner buys the other partner’s share, should that be treated as a sale of the complete property, with both partners paying CGT, then the remaining partner buying the property at what be a new purchase price, which would be off set against the sale price at a later date. Alternatively, the selling partner could pay CGT on the half share at the time, and the buying partner would have the complete property but the two halves or it would effectively have different purchase prices, and dates of purchase. Subsequent improvements made would then be offset against which half? For investment properties belonging to a deceased party, disposal of the property should be taxed as if the deceased had disposal of the property themselves. What assets should be covered, given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars. CGT should apply to land with or without buildings, and possibly shares Shares are a different type of asset, and a CGT on shares may need to be treated differently with the proviso that shares in companies which only owned property did not allow arbitrage between two different tax processes. A difficulty is that property speculation may be enacted over a periods of months, whereas speculation on futures may be enacted over minutes or hours. Records relating to the buying and selling of other assets are haphazard at best and would be difficult to police. However, the existing tax system allows for the taxing of regular trading when IRD believe it is an income generating activity. As rental housing is an integral part of the means by which people are housed it may be worth considering an exemption for this category if other criteria were met, as a CGT on this form of investment might push rentals up to compensate, and also drive investors out of that form of investment thus pushing up rents because of lack of supply. Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? KiwiSaver assets should be exempt CGT . Retirement saving should be encouraged, and not taxing KiwiSaver assets should encourage people to join. The difference between KiwiSaver and other savings schemes is that withdrawals can only be made in certain circumstances, so the non-taxing of assets could not be used as a tax avoidance vehicle. Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Assets held overseas by New Zealand tax payers should be dealt with the same as assets held in New Zealand. If the overseas administration also levied a tax, this would have to be taken into account when calculating New Zealand tax liability. How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules. No comment When should non-residents be subject to tax? Non-residents should be taxed by the same rules as New Zealand residents. Advertisements targeting foreign speculators have been common since the early 2000s. This question may no longer apply since many foreign buyers are now prevented from buying New Zealand property. Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis, tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. Ring fencing would seem appropriate. Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? Yes. If the investment is like for like, there would presumably be tax levied when that type of investment was finally exited. Each time an investment was rolled over the clock could be reset to zero, so that under the existing bright line test, the 5 years would start again. For example, roll-over relief would be appropriate where an existing rental property could not economically be brought up to new standards for such properties, so disposal and purchase of a more suitable property would be appropriate. How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? No Comment. How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Gifts of taxable assets such as property would have to be subject to CGT to prevent one party “gifting” a property to another then the second party “gifting” some money back to the first party. However, gifts in general should not be taxed. Gambling is usually a loss- making activity, so should not be taxed. What should the rate of tax on capital gains be - the normal income tax rates, or some other tax rate(s)? One of the drivers of a CGT is to reduce speculative pressure on house prices. It would therefore make sense to have a very high tax rate initially and reducing over time. A suggested formula would be a 100% tax payable for an initial period, say one year, then a linear (or other) reduction from 100% down to 33% over the next 2 years, then a flat 33% from 3 to 5 years followed by a linear reduction to zero at 7 years. The rationale behind this approach is that property speculation would become unviable. Having an end date also allows for potential taxpayers not to have to keep records for excessive periods of time, the current requirement being 7 years, and does help prevent the “lock in” effect by allowing for some turnover of investment property. It avoids having to account for capital improvements even building replacements occurring over an indefinite period. The formula for the above for linear reductions would be: Round up to the nearest whole number of months for which the asset was held = m For m=0 to 12 months Tax rate on Gain – expenses = 100 % For m=12 to 36 months Tax rate on Gain – expenses = (133.5 – 67 x m/24) % For m=36 to 60 months Tax rate on Gain – expenses = 33 % For m=60 to 84 months Tax rate on Gain – expenses = (115.5 – 11 x m/8) % For m > 84 months. No tax Supplements to a CGT could be: Requiring part or all interest claimed during the holding of a property to be paid back out of the capital gain at disposal time. This would prevent excessive gearing which is often an indication that an investment has been made for capital gains. Limiting the frequency of disposals (this is already part of the bright line test for some properties) Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? An allowance for inflation would seem fair. Should there be a de minimis rule? A de minimis rule would apply where the cost of administration was larger than the amount of tax gathered. However, if a tax is well designed and implemented electronically the cost of administration should be low. What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). New Zealand already has a “Bright Line” test for capital gains, so there will be tax payers who have been keeping records of capital expenditure since its introduction. However, taxpayers who have held properties for longer periods may not have records for past capital expenditure as they would not have been required to keep them. A clean start with existing disposals dealt with by the rules in place at purchase time would avoid such problems. All taxable assets purchased after an implementation date would be tested against the new rule (if there is a new rule) at that date, and continue to be so. How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Trusts should be dealt with as any other taxpayer. However, my knowledge of the law around trusts is limited, so they may be other considerations.

Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 1 Index. A. Overview B. Social Issues C. HEW issues D. Health E. Education F. Welfare G. Other Government Expenditure H. Business in the future I. Revenue J. Trusts K. Government Charges L. Housing M. Charities N. International O. Commitment to all A. Overview The three major areas of Government annual expenditure are Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). When addressing Government revenue in the 21 st century, the two key considerations must be to set parameters and goals of what the Government’s function can and should be in a rapidly changing world and how optimally to best fill that role, then to equitably source the required enabling revenue, while growing the economy at the same time to facilitate as little anguish as possible on the populace at large, to supply that revenue. My submissions deliberately focus on the cost (HEW) aspect also because these are inextricably linked and while dealing with them individually is often done, I do recognise the task of modernising the intricacies of all components of these three Ministries and their functioning is a monumental challenge. I believe that to be an absolute necessity, along with addressing “ a 21 st century economy” if this country seriously intends to stay remotely close to climbing back into the leading top 10 of nations, calculated on median income per capita. At the same time, with the simple observation below that continuing the same old practices will bring the same old results that simply bring ever increasing dissatisfaction with Government service delivery performance. This correctly suggests it is well past time for some major changes, which falls on Government shoulders fairly and squarely to deliver on. Of course overnight changes are not always possible, but then we have seen major changes like those in 1986, with the introduction of GST and the many consequential changes that went with that major broadening of the tax base. The success of that has since seen many other countries adopt similar legislation. Apart from the specifics mentioned above there is the question of what functions Government really needs to be part of in tomorrow’s world, which a separate matter for investigation, regardless of any ideologies or populist mind set. Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 2 B. Social issues Open and free speech to express real opinion is absolutely essential in anything remotely resembling what can be called a democratic society and I welcome that. This also includes open Government. I can all see (although some people need to actually open their eyes and look), that the status quo is not good enough in so many aspects of New Zealand society. NZ is not a large country and we have a relatively direct form of government, which allows for a reasonable level of citizenry input into our “political machine.” I suggest that measuring our so-called progress against other countries is NOT secondary to just getting on with making “our place” a much better one. So who is not delivering and what are they not delivering? We can (and need to), do better, but will we?? A plan is essential with action to follow, all based on what the Government and country can afford. It will take time to implement. Consider the following: 1. Child poverty stands at 14% - NZ is bottom of the developed world. 2. Homelessness-between 2006 and 2013, this grew by 25% and is now the worst in the developed world. 3. NZ has a teenage suicide rate that is more than double any other developed country. 4. NZ has the highest rate of teenage births- 233 out of every 1000 births. 5. We have the second highest rate of bullying in the OECD. 6. We have the worst levels of family violence in the developed world. 7. 32% of kiwi children are obese or overweight 8. NZ has the 3 rd highest overall obesity levels in the world and nothing is being done to change this, apart from more synthetic drugs, instead of changing lifestyles. 9. Kiwi 10 year olds have dropped below the median global reading level. 10. Suicide accounts for 41% of deaths in males aged 15-24. 11. Our skin cancer rates are the highest in the world (4 times more than Canada, the US and the UK). 12. Economic inequality has increased substantially over the last 30 years or so, and recently has been made even worse by the extraordinary rise in property prices. Feudalism is just around the corner, heading our way like a freight train. Today 42% of households live from payday to payday, a level that has risen markedly over the last generation when we also witnessed most households needing at least two incomes to manage their needs, rather than a single income. So many jobs are only part time, not full time. (Increasing inequality almost seems to match the increasing prison population over recent years). 13. We have a health system that has costs and demands rising some way above population increases as does with the education system. In both cases, the comments above clearly demonstrate that we have a lot of serious and smart work to do, if we are to move forward and continue the decline into an even worse mess...... 14. Much of the true level of environmental degradation in NZ has been (and continues to be) swept under the carpet. Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 3 So, is New Zealand really a good place to raise a family and plan for a long term life for yourselves and your family? Real employment opportunities, social skills, crime laws, health and education and inequality must all be seriously tackled head on, otherwise we may return to the standing comment from a few decades back –“will the last person to leave NZ please turn the lights off.” As an example, incomes in Australia (both per capita and median) in 2013 and 2017 continue to be 30% above their NZ equivalent. If we keep doing the same old things how can we expect the results to change? Enough said!! C. HEW issues While many would say that growing the size of the pie is the key which brings improved economic outcomes across the community, that dictum has proven to be largely a fallacy if the last 30 years or so can be used as a measure. Inequality has grown significantly over that time, telling me that more needed to be done to have reduced or prevented the deterioration in social outcomes mentioned above. Adjustment must be made, as it rather obvious that the lower income groups are totally unable to contribute any further to assist the corrections required, the upper income taxpayers must be prepared to do so. Measurement and reporting of incomes, living costs (HEW costs related included), all asset classes, inflation, and so on must be also reviewed to clearly show the real impact, across society of living standards, trends, all to demonstrate with full transparency, just how society is progressing or declining with living standards. D. Health While the health of the population has been one of taking personal responsibility, this has failed in the sense that today we see some major, but largely preventable sicknesses and diseases, causing major costs to families, Government and society overall. At the same time, there is a very noticeable absence of leadership when it comes to preventative steps, at almost all levels, including Government. Now is the time for Government to step up and introduce steps to change this for the better. Healthy living and lifestyle are practices which many people know very little about, and there can and should be a philosophical decision made to tell people, by advertising, by all health professionals, what they can do to improve/maintain good health for a much more extended part of their lives. For example, why should the Government NOT commit $50 million of the annual Health vote to advertise healthy food options and regularly show on TV/in magazines/newspapers the available quality information that will start to save the overall health costs for New Zealand. At the same time, why do doctors NOT STUDY NUTRITION at medical school? This must be addressed too! In the education system, at all levels, why is nothing included as a serious consideration, even if in many homes that could mean more of the children telling their parent/s what is better? What about a Government website (regularly updated and added to) to go along with all of this? Surely, this would increasingly save the country billions of dollars. The health professionals must be taken along on this journey, not left behind, as they will be more responsible, not less, if they take the initiative and get recognised for that leadership role in improving the health of the nation. How can a fat doctor, who knows little about nutrition and a healthy diet, give meaningful advice to his patients, other that prescribing medication that usually addresses symptoms and not causes? I acknowledge that there are players in the health industry who may consider themselves to be adversely impacted by such propositions, but we do live in changing times and change for the better of the large majority of society cannot be withdrawn, denied or withheld in a truly democratic society. As such proposals will take time to be implemented, vested interests will have time to adjust Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 4 to new realities, which we all often face in our personal lives. Several aspects of alternative health treatments really do deliver good results. I am personally an example of that. E. Education Some mention was made in the comments on health above, but there are other measures that the education system should address for the 21 st century. These include teacher training, curriculum detail, a refocus on tomorrow’s societal realities. Are there subject matters that school do or do not have to teach in the first half of the 21 st century? I am not trying to focus on saving on education, rather to ensure the maximum value is obtained for the money invested in what is the most important social spend Government has got to deliver on. Technological progress is rapid and not slowing down and how this can be utilised to not be too expensive for widespread application in schools must be considered urgently. Many preschool children know how to use many high tech appliances before they start school, suggesting they are up and running for tomorrows living, in many cases even surprising their parents, and almost alarming their grandparents. This is all future gazing, but indicates the direction society is headed and if New Zealand is to do anything to give us even a reasonable chance of making this country into any sort of success within a generation, then education has got to refocus and do so quickly. One aspect that really interests me is that with the massive explosion in information and learning that has taken place since the internet, is not that I know (and retain) so much, rather, it is how do I find out about any question I might have on virtually any subject? So how should education reflect this best, as we do not have the time to learn “so much,” but instead we need to know where to find the answers? As there are households which perhaps may not have the internet that provide good study/printing, scanning options, the school system must address that? Not necessarily, as some bulk teaching options will develop. There are some online options from some universities. Can this be extended to schools at all? Yes there are issues, such as some moving subjects, but many are not, they simply remain as they are and/or get built on? Neither should social skills development be neglected in the school operating manual of the future. School capital costs are not cheap and the example of Singapore brings to mind that large urban centres could investigate better use of school properties, such as a two “shifts” each day? The simple reason I have included these notes on education is the possibilities that may emerge from a “21 st century” approach to education and how that can positively impact on both Government costs and therefore tax revenues. F. Welfare Not because the elderly in our population are growing as percentage of the population, but because they, as much as everybody else need to make a contribution to society, at least, in some proportion to their ability to do so. This is why income testing at a level well above the average income can and should be considered seriously. It will not impact many people, but is part of addressing inequality and not all people affected will deny the societal benefits, especially if the extra tax take from that is committed to good use, which needs to be demonstrated as well. G. Other Government Expenditure Infrastructure expenditure is the other cost centre that consumes large Government dollars. A strong future focus may require some borrowing in addition to tax changes, but payback considerations will no doubt direct where priorities should be. While there is always likely to be Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 5 objectors to many proposals, overall national interests are paramount and not local ones and along with long term planning must be the focus of selling infrastructure development to the public. H. Business in the future Incentives may be something to be planned for to help transform some parts of our economy into future success. There are examples both here and overseas where this is being done and NZ needs to address this, at the same time possibly removing some existing incentives that no longer suit the future economy. This should be aimed at really assisting the transforming of the economy to the 21 st century. I am not very fully informed of the arrangements with the Bluff aluminium smelter and the overall cost/ benefit to this country, except that the smelter consumes significant (and cheap) electricity. If the smelter was closed and the power was made available for other purposes, the long term benefits would/could be major. Population growth (higher tax take) and conversion of most land transport to electricity ( major reduction in hydro carbon import costs), are both examples of major benefit areas to Government and the national economy, and the capital cost of additional electricity generation would, for some time, be postponed at the very least. Obviously there will be short term costs, so timing, financial and social impacts must be factored in. The recent decision to no longer issues permits for offshore exploration of oil and gas will see Government revenue decline from royalties, and various forms of tax and associated revenue, along with Taranaki in particular gradually suffering job losses, a downturn in several servicing businesses and social adversities. Overall losses of Government revenue could reach $1 billion annually? Over the longer term, the overall effect on tax revenue would be positive, but planning needs to be considered at this time, to secure and encourage replacement (and greater) economic activity which is capable of more than replacing the revenue losses here. What resources do we have or will need for this in the way of natural, people and financial to build that future, with a surging population increase, in a way that is both socially acceptable and provides reasonable incomes and tax revenue for government? I. Revenue Australia’s Labour introduced a capital gains tax (CGT) in 1985 and has been part of their tax system since. No Liberal Government sought to really reverse that, but did modify the cost to individuals. Surely we can learn the best and worst experiences there and introduce an appropriate CGT here. This would go some way toward reducing economic inequality and over time broaden the tax base in a responsible and widely accepted manner. GST has a lot less impact on high income earners due to the simple fact they must spend much less of their income on day to day living. Low income earners and beneficiaries (apart mostly from rent and mortgage interest) pay GST on basically everything. If this was intended to raise the effective tax rate on lower income earners, it worked, but in my view, very unfairly, based on ability to pay. An adjunct to that and to the health discussion above, removing GST on healthy food (not fast food of processed food) would alleviate many lower household budget woes. The whole area of company tax requires a serious review, although I would expect that the introduction of the new “smart” IRD computer may assist, there are still doubts in my mind about the effectiveness and policing of Fringe Benefit Tax. The level of deductible expenditure in the area subject to FBT appears to be very low, if the level of FBT being paid is any indication of the “real” level of costs that may be subject to FBT. Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 6 The overall company income tax rate has been to some extent driven by the downward movement in overseas countries and our wish to attract more international business here, but as we have lowered the rates, have we, at the same time, also considered the whole range of deductibles and Fringe Benefits. If overseas lowering of corporate tax rates continue and to be competitive, NZ felt it necessary to follow suit, then some offsetting factors should be considered at that time. All aspects of the international tax system must be tightened in conjunction with not only our key trading partners, but done so in a way that we are not the tail trying to wag the dog. Take a leadership role here in an endeavour to get a deal that is fair and in no way is against our best interests. Treasury did some homework in 2013 on not only would legalising cannabis bring in worthwhile tax revenue, but they also reported savings through such drug reform, by easing pressure on the justice system and fewer convictions for youth and Maori. They noted also that alcohol and tobacco have consistently been more health damaging than some illegal drugs such as cannabis. There are many rules and regulations covering many aspects of our lives, so surely cannabis is no different and could be regulated to protect the vulnerable, especially individuals who have not reached adulthood (like alcohol). The misunderstood commercial hemp possibilities are massive and varied, with the potential to make a substantial contribution to diversifying the economy, providing jobs, a huge variety of locally produced products, save imports and bring some export income also. It is nothing like cannabis and this needs to be recognised, to allow that industry to grow, thrive and make the worthwhile benefits to the country that it will be quite capable of doing, given the removal of obstacles. J. Trusts have long been a vehicle to protect family assets, but should not be available as a tool to avoid tax which otherwise be incurred. Has this been fully addressed and even more so now with such a large number of trusts that seem to have been used or in use? K. Government charges A clear policy needs to be made transparent to the public, stating that such charges cover costs, or are part of revenue gathering. Does Government plan to review various operating functions and ministries to determine if cost savings can be made, or charges need to be increased or decreased, as an aside to funding of various services? I make this comment because a future focus could bring out issues aligned to these points, possibly impacting the tax system. L. Housing I am not sure that any information has been compiled to support my contention that the residential rental investment market has been responsible for a larger portion of high house prices than is thought. Recent changes by the last National Government may helped alleviate this, but I suspect not and I see a further review of this may help. My reasoning is that multiple residential property ownership reduces the housing supply for sale and while increasing the rental supply, does so at a time when we have seen high immigration, adding to the rental demands as well. Therefore overall, has this made the situation worse, or is it just a house shortage? Who owns all the unoccupied houses around the country? Can they be factored into solving the supposed housing shortage? M. Charities I am not alone when it comes to my belief that there is significant concern that this is one area that is long overdue for an in-depth review and re-appraisal of defining the whole matter of what actually constitutes a charity (either in part or totally) for tax purposes, . Examples include churches and Submissions to the Tax Working Group 2018 7 sports clubs, but there are others as well. Commercial activities conducted by the likes of the Sanitarium “company” has long brought grumbles in the public arena. N. International As a trading nation very dependent on export income and International tourism we must continually search for ways and means to “stay up with the game” at the very least. We are very vulnerable because we still rely on a narrow base of major export primary products. As price takers, we are exposed, so all initiatives to diversify our overseas earnings must be explored, such as in the technology fields. At the same time, reducing import costs also require continual searching, like the hydrocarbons we import, so import substitution becomes vital wherever possible. The impact of these issues must be factored into short to medium term tax planning by Government and meaningful thought being regularly and at all times to be at the forefront of meeting the future head on with the best plan possible. Our primary industries have served us well, but with changing geopolitical moods and developments, trade differences, sanctions, technologies and so on, the Government must always ensure NZ is not over exposed to debt, in both the Government and private sector. This always needs to be included in all tax considerations by Government. Encouragement now to diversify the economy and tax take are both absolutely vital for government to take a leadership role in, to avoid a slide in our living standards over the next generation, greater than we seen over the last generation. O. Commitment to benefit all So do we have the fortitude and determination to really achieve something here? I doubt that we will, because as a society, too many of expect someone else to do the yards, pay the costs, so they themselves can still retain their cruisy lifestyles. As that great character Billy T James said, his problem was that he was half Scotch and half Maori – one half wanted to get drunk, but the other half did not want to pay for it. Regardless, we cannot fail to try and tackle the problems and issues preventing the country from making the progress necessary to achieve what we can and must do, if we genuinely desire to be a first world country in the foreseeable future. Tinkering with the current state of affairs will not achieve what this country is capable of, so some bold decisions and actions are much more likely to. 29 April 2018 \[1\]

Submission toTaxation inquiry; A Rolling Capital Gains tax for Housing Sean Devine  April 29, 2018 1 Summary This submission argues that housing and property should be the key fo- cus of a capital gains or similar tax. Figures that have been reprocessed from those in Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the 21st Century” \[1\] con- clusively show that, in contrast to productive investment, capital gains on un-productive investment, such as housing and property, has seriously distorted several European economies over the decades. Unearned capital gains is economically destructive. The solution is an appropriate tax, but the purpose of such a tax cannot be to increase tax revenue. Its primary purpose must be to constrain a section of the population gaining unearned income at the expense of the productive sector. If such a tax is successful, capital gains will be minimal, the economy will thrive, but there will be little tax revenue The removal of an economic distortion due to investment in assets that capture unearned income, will generate far more economic benefits than any income redistribution possible from a higher tax take. The recommendation is that a rolling capital gains tax, on most houses and property, where each year a relatively low provisional tax would be applied on estimated capital gains, similar to the way rates are calculated. The debits and credits of the tax would be carried forward and, at the time of sale, a full capital gains tax would be applied, taking into account the  Dr SeanDevine's has worked as a scientist and science manager. He studied economics in the mid 1980s leading to taking on the role of Programme Manager at the Foundation for Research Science and Technology. He later became Executive Director of the Association of Crown Research Institutes. He has been involved with two technological companies and has, more recently lectured in strategy to postgraduate students. Sean is now retired. 1 \[1\] accumulated debits or credits over the years. The aim is to dis-incentivise property investment by an immediate tax now to clearly signal a further tax will be collected later. 2 Introduction 2.1 The critical termused in the submisison = the Capital to Income ratio of an economy. Ifis roughly flat over the decades, it indicates that incomes from investments are growing in proportion to the investments. If, on the other hand,is rising, incomes are not rising with investment and the fruits of productivity are not being distributed justly. 2.2 The core issues The value of our current house would have been $15,000 in 1970. Some 47 years later it is now worth more than $600,000. Yet, even allowing for general inflation, this wealth increase is unearned and is unrelated to any productive activity. Irrespective of fairness, economies that allow capital gains to divert investment from productive to non-productive activities, such as housing fail, their citizens. This submission is focussing on the taxation of unearned wealth, which is defined as wealth that is not related to increased production. As in the housing and property market in New Zealand, unearned capital gains redistributes the fruits of production to the non-productive sector. This submission is based on evidence from the on-line data used in Thomas Piketty’s book “Capital in the 21st Century” \[1\] but Piketty’s figures have been redrawn to separate out productive and housing wealth for three European nations. Because Piketty’s analysis has not separated productive from unpro- ductive wealth, his narrative fails to diagnose the situation adequately. Piketty’s concern is about “Who owns the investment?” rather than the concern here, which is “Who gains the benefits from the investment?”. The critical issue is illustrated in in Figures 1, 2 and 3, . These figures use Piketty’s on-line data, but separate productive from housing investment. Where the Capital to Income rationis roughly constant over the decades, as is the case for productive investment, society as a whole gains with increasing investment. Here productive investments is taken to be investments where the Capital to Income ratiochanges little over the decades. Non-productive investments are characterised by a sharply risingover the same period. Whenis rising sharply, as it does for France’s housing (see figure 1), and to a lesser extent for the UK and Germany, benefits are not being distributed widely. Instead the benefits of unearned wealth are accumulating to property 2 owners. The problem is not the failure to tax unearned capital gains, the failure is to allow a section of the community to extract wealth from the productive sector. As Piketty failed to distinguish investment in existing housing from invest- ment that increases productivity, his conclusions are flawed. This oversight allows Piketty to wrongly attribute the sharp rise infor France the UK and Germany to both productive and non-productive investment as can be seen in the graphs from “Capital in the 21st Century” \[1\] reproduced in the Appendix. Because Piketty has not separated these two types of investment, the very in- vestments we need to create jobs and to increase productivity, share the blame with housing for poor economic performance. This submission analyses the data from Europe to show that unearned wealth is economically destructive, effectively taking income from the wealth creators, including employees, and distributing it to those who are just recycling existing wealth. If a Picasso costs $1000 in terms of time spent producing the art work, but later sells for $1 million, no more wealth has been created, rather wealth has just been redistributed. In contrast to housing, this increase in wealth is not critical as few need a Picasso, yet all need a home to live in. The long term issue is is to constrain investments for capital gains in favour of investments in productive enterprises. A failure to do so penalises the productive sector of the economy by not only reducing productive economic activity, but misappropriating the income from production. 3 Piketty's gures show only housing is the prob- lem Figures 1, 2, and 3, , are reproduced from Piketty’s on-line data. However, in contrast to Piketty’s own figures \[1\] reproduced in the appendix, the figures here, which separate the value offor productive activity and none-productive activity, show housing and only housing is the problem. This separation makes it clear that for France, the UK and Germany,, the Capital to Income ratio for productive investment (the blue curve), has been relatively stable since WWII, showing there is little, if any, economic distortion with productive investment. However as for these economiesfor housing (the red curve) has been sharply rising, housing is extracting wealth from the productive sector. France has the worst housing problem where the sharp rise inindicates a seriously unbalanced economy. This may be an important factor contributing to France’s unemploy- ment level of 10% despite. The level is concerning as France came out of the Global Financial Crash well compared with the UK. It is whenis rising sharply, not when the rate of return on capital is greater than GDP growth, as Piketty claims that unearned income accumulates. These 3 Figure 1: productive and non-productive capital for France Figure 2: productive and non-productive capital for Germany Figure 3: productive and non-productive capital for the UK 4 figures show the economic distortion occurring whenis allowed to rise sharply, as the as is the case for housing in these three economies, benefits of investment are accumulating to a few and are not distributed to the wider economy. On the other hand, the benefits of the investment in the productive sector are not accumulating, and there is no problem to be solved. Whereis roughly flat, investment in more factories and technologies, not only increases returns to the owner, but creates more jobs increasing national income. The next section shows how this understanding affects taxation policy. 3.1 Taxing housing capital gains The position here is that the taxation focus must be on removing the economic distortion of capital gains on housing, not on increasing the tax take. The aim is to reduce capital gains to zero, and in so doing stimulate the economy. The economic benefits in doing this far outweigh the benefits of an increased tax take, to redistribute. Furthermore, as a normal capital gains tax is collected in the future, it pro- vides little immediate incentive to change investment behaviour. Furthermore, those needing to sell and buy a similar house will find it financially difficult if in doing so they must pay a large tax on capital gains. As many home owners buy to achieve capital gains, a tax regime needs to discourage this practice. A variable tax rate or no tax at all can be applied to lower value houses. This leaves two taxation possibilities. The first is the Morgan Foundation’s “Capital Comprehensive Tax”; the second is a “Rolling Capital Gains Tax” that tracks debts and credits over the years as a provisional tax, to be offset against a later capital gains tax. Each has issues that need to be considered as outlined below. 3.1.1 The Capital Comprehensive Tax (CCT) Others will no doubt provide submissions on the CCT, but the basic idea is that certain assets, such as housing, pay an annual tax, similar to rates, based on the value of the asset. In this case the suggested tax is 6 % per annum. But the purpose should not be to collect more tax or redistribute income, its primary purpose should be stop the leakage of earned wealth to those who have not earned it. The difficulty is that many New Zealanders will not have available income to pay such a tax. Furthermore, if the tax works, there may be no increase in capital to borrow against a mortgage to pay the tax. Quite simply a 6% tax say on $ 1 million Auckland hme would be unsustainable, and no Government implementing such a tax is likely to stay in power. 5 Also, a CCT for productive assets is likely to be counter productive even if offset against other tax paid, because of the difficulty in assessing what actually needs to be taxed. What appears to be increased value today may be intended to generate taxable income tomorrow. A CCT on productive assets could well discourage company investment. The figures for France, Germany and the UK, and therefore probably for New Zealand, show that at the economy level there is not taxation problem to solve. The CCT might work if the level was low, similar to the level of rates, and could be adjusted depending on the rise of house prices. But the aim should not be to redistribute wealth, but to constrain investment in existing housing. It would be unwise to apply the CCT for other assets such as shares in the meantime, until there is certainty it will not do harm. 3.1.2 The preferred option, a Rolling Capital Gains Tax Rather than taxing capital gains in the future, which will have little effect on current behaviour, a rolling capital gains tax could be instituted based on a tax on the current housing inflation rate. The tax collected annually, should involve debits when prices rise. and credits when prices fall, and the accumulated debts and credits tracked until the house is sold. At that time, a final higher level of tax could be collected, taking into account tax already paid. If the rolling tax is not too high, house owners with reasonable equity could expect the bank top provide a loan to pay the rolling tax using the mortgage as collateral. For example, if a $1 million house inflates at 5% per year, the assumed income is $50,000 and the tax would be a percentage of this, say 5%. In the initial stages it should be similar to the level of rates, until the system beds in. If house prices continue to rise, the percent level should increase accordingly until the incentive to invest in housing decreases. In other words adjust the level to achieve the desired aim of low inflation for houses investment 3.1.3 Warning: The \\rst do no harm" principle An economy is a complex system and the rule for intervening in a complex system follows the rule of the physician encapsulated in the Hippocratic Oath; “ First do no harm”. The following are possible harmful effects that need to be taken into consideration, suggesting any change in the tax regime should be implemented gradually at lower levels. Current low interest rates incentivise property investment, as real returns after tax and inflation make saving for retirement difficult. As even a nest egg of $500,000 returns little, it is rational for the individual to invest in housing, even if it is disastrous from the societal view point. 6 Property developers are creating new wealth and should already be paying tax on profits. A new form of tax, if applied to property developers, could constraining building construction as it might become too risky. Retirement villages are based on the premise that homeowners can sell their home to buy assets in the retirement village at a reasonable price. But the profitability of retirement villages depends on the capital gains on the retirement units when ownership passes back to the village, at a price related to the initial purchase price. However, as retirement villages or homes are becoming a major part of our housing stock, the impact of a capital gains tax on these needs to be carefully considered. The rental charged by owners of good rental properties (rather than slums) are often low relative to costs, as investors expect the capital to gains to compensate for low rental returns. Rents will probably need to increase in the short term, once housing inflation stabilises. 4 Recommendation A rolling capital gains tax should be applied at a modest level to ensure that it is not removed by any subsequent government. Coupled with this is a final capital gains tax based on the increase in house value when sold. The debits and credits of the rolling tax can be treated as a provisional tax to be offset against the tax on gains at the time of sale. The levels can be adjusted to maintain low house inflation. 5 Appendix:Piketty's Graphs The data used in figures 1, 2 and 3 and have been extracted from data used in the following graphs from Piketty. See figure 4 below the bibliography. However the data of concern starts from 1950 rather than the earlier dates in Figure 4. The point to notice is that Piketty’s graphs do not separate productive from unproductive investment, and therefore the graphs fail to indicate that only housing is the source of rapidly increasing Capital to Income ratio. The values ofor Capital to Income ratio are given on theyaxes in the figures below. References \[1\] T. Piketty.Capital in the Twenty-First Century.

Submission on Tax to the Tax Working Group By Stephen Howard The Question of the Function of Taxation The first thing to consider when thinking about tax is “What is the function of taxation?” My thinking on this follows modern monetary theory and Richard Murphy in “The Joy of Tax” especially this quote; It’s important that we get away from this idea that tax is “taking my money”. Tax is what allows us to make a living in the first place, it’s our contribution to a complex society. Without tax most of the things in modern society that we rely on would not be present. We do need to learn to love tax. Tax has been framed as a burden but really without our society would be a lot worse and a lot more unequal. The most important lesson we learn from Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is that a government with a sovereign currency and without an overwhelming foreign debt has to ability to create whatever money supply is required by fiscal spending and control the heat in the economy with taxation. This means that the formation of money supply, fiscal spending and tax are closely linked in any democracy with a sovereign currency and should be considered together. This implies that a government is not required to allow commercial banks to create money by debt creation, as we do now, with the Reserve Bank attempting to control the amount of money with interest rates, or open market actions, and control commercial banking with “light handed regulation. Light handed regulation is no regulation. And control of money supply by Reserve Bank activities such as the interest rates of Overnight Cash Flow is not in the best interest of New Zealand. It also implies that it is the function of taxation in controlling money supply that should be given greater consideration in setting taxes than revenue collection. It also means tax is not restrained by the idea given by the Laffer Curve. We need to recognise that funding government spending is not the function of taxation. And so balancing the Government Budget and neoliberal austerity (or fiscal responsibility as some call it) should not be the only consideration when setting tax regimes. This also implies that there is no need for the Cullen fund or semi government bodies such as ACC fully forward funding. Functions of Taxation I consider taxation to have the following functions and I list some implications of each function \[1\] Supporting the value of money. It only by the Government only accepting money in payment of tax and the settling legal claims that money is given any credibility. Rather than legal tender laws it is the use of a sovereign currency to meet taxation requirements that creates the legitimacy of money. Encouraging change in the organization of the economy By charging those economic activities that are "bad" and spending on those that are "good" a government may be able to guide the organisation of the economy and economic activities. High royalties on scarce resources and charges for socially damaging activities of firms can nudge firm’s behaviour into more socially responsible directions. Care should be taken to retain other sanctions against antisocial or environmentally damaging activities as simple charges can have the unforeseen consequence of having firms seeing those charges as giving permission to act, the “we have paid for the right to act irresponsibly so we will” effect. The Working Group should consider; • A carbon tax (charge at source or border) with the dual aim of reducing global warming pressures and supporting those economic activities that mitigate again environmental damage and social disruption. • Pollution charges on Councils releasing sewerage, industrial, agriculture and forestry. Each and all these entities could be nudged towards a more responsible approach with costs that reflect the long term damage and inter-generational justice needs. • Increasing road user charges to fully reflect the costs of road building and maintenance. Such a tax (charge) would encourage firms moving goods to reconsider the mode of transport they use, and at the same time encourage the concept of local production for local consumption that is so necessary if the government is serious about addressing climate change. • The usual range of vice taxes. Redistributing income and wealth, to ensure equality and social cohesion. This is an obvious function of taxation and implies the use of • Capital taxes. • Capital gains taxes. • Estate duties. • High corporate taxes • Taxing of non-charitable trusts at the same levels as individual income tax rates. • And, most importantly, a highly progressive system of income taxes with a non-taxed income of at least equivalent to the aged pension with many brackets above it and a high rate for top brackets. Bracket creep is a wonderful thing, both an automatic stabiliser and a drive towards greater equality Repricing goods and services in a similar way to the above to nudge consumers. This could mean such actions like reducing or removing GST on local produced fresh food and keeping it high or increasing it on socially or damaging things like tobacco, petrol or alcohol Increasing and supporting the commitment people have to democracy. Evidence from the UK is that when local government started using PPPs to deliver public services, interest in local democracy dropped. Taxing brings to people's attention the need for representation, and makes them feel they have skin in the game. Recycling money the government has spent into the economy for re-use and to control the money supply. To repeat using bracket creep as an automatic stabiliser rather that interests rates being set by as supposedly independent central bank is a far better way to control money supply and to avoid runaway inflation as a result of government spending to create money. This would require a tax free income up to a reasonable amount, say the amount of the old age pension and then a high progress scale above that with many more brackets than presently used. Utilising this concept of money supply takes the control of the economy away from foreign banks and puts it into the hand of a government which is subject to democratic scrutiny It is time to replace the misleading concept of an “independent” Central Bank controlling the money supply in an objective way and realise that such bankers are rarely independent of the commercial banking sector but are independent of the democratically elected parliament. Recent failure of monetary policy in the face of the Global Financial Crisis shows that it is time to move on from Friedmanite monetary policy and accept tax and fiscal spending as the main economic levers that a nation has.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP By Susan Short Thank you for the opportunity to share my views about the current tax system. I have commented on other issues using your online facility, but in this submission I am confining my comments to the taxation of businesses which operate under registered charity status. I believe it is time the fiscal issue of favourable tax treatment of for-profit commercial charities is addressed. Incomes derived from activities of a commercial nature should be included in the tax base. Is the tax system fair, you ask? Regarding the matter of commercial arms of charities able to claim income tax exemptions, the answer is no, it is most definitely not fair at all. I offer the following reasons: • My own family of small business operators work very hard, year in year out, to keep their businesses afloat – all the while paying their taxes. Such tax payers are among those who are, in effect, subsidising tax-free commercial enterprises operating as charities. These organisations use the facilities and services the state provides, yet do not contribute to the tax take which funds these services. Instead they are getting a free ride on the backs of tax paying companies and citizens. • By not paying tax on their businesses ventures, commercial operators that have obtained charitable status gain a competitive advantage over other businesses that do contribute to the wider society by paying income tax. This is very unfair. Therefore, I am recommending amendments to the legislation relating to charities. There is an urgent need for fundamental reform relating to the trading activities of charitable operations - this to include the definition of ‘charities’. Several commercial charitable operations are experiencing phenomenal growth, in no small way assisted by their tax-free status. Other businesses are finding it very difficult to compete with such an economic advantage, and are in danger of either going out of business, or selling to these ‘charitable’ corporations. After all, what for-profit business could possibly compete against an entity with such a privileged fiscal status? I am asking you to look to the future - 10, 20, 30 years and more. Unless this anomalous situation is rectified, it is inevitable these ‘tax-free’ organisations will make up a bigger share of the country’s economy. This will have a negative effect on the government coffers, a situation which will become more pronounced over time. The question we will be forced to face as a country is, ‘who is going to make up the resultant short-fall in the tax take created by this situation’? Does the government expect other businesses and citizens to pay more tax? Or will the country be forced to borrow more, (most certainly not a long-term solution)? And/or will government spending need to be curbed? Recommendations I endorse Sir Michael Cullen’s recommendation to tax the trading operations of charities, as made in 2001 while the Minister of Finance. The most sensible way forward would be to enact the suggestion to tax for-profit businesses owned by charities in the same way that other businesses are taxed, while allowing deductions on distributions made to their relevant charities. This policy change would remove any unfair tax advantage that charity-owned businesses have over other commercial entities. A recommended course of action could be to require businesses to file their accounts independently of their related charitable purpose entities, with funds being supplied from the commercial entities in the form of donations that are treated as deductible items of expenditure by the commercial entities to the extent of their taxable income. In addition, Charities Services needs a stronger monitoring regime to reassure the public that distributed funds are being used in a genuine way. In making such changes, the Government would be doing the right thing by ensuring that anyone who is using charities for tax avoidance pay their ‘fair share’. 28 April 2018 Susan Short \[1\]

Submission to the tax Working Group In 1988 the Rt.Hon. David Langey suggested that the 4th Labour Government should take a pause from the hectic economic reforms of the time. 30 years is a long time to nurse that "cup of tea". Now it's time to put New Zealand back at the forefront of economic reform, by simplifying the tax system, and reducing the sources of tax. What do we Tax? We tax salt and iron pots, like they did in Babylon and ancient China, on the basis that everybody uses them, so everybody will pay their share of tax. Of course nowadays we tax many more things, but the thinking is still the same, extract revenue for the State from some market activity or product. But the complexity of the modern system allows devious individuals to manipulate their business dealings to avoid paying tax. There is one item that is universally used, that cannot yet be avoided, that is money: the New Zealand dollar. Technology has improved since Mr. Langey's time such that almost all payments and receipts pass through some electronic ledger system, and can be tracked in almost real time. This makes it easy to tax the use of money. Transaction Tax: Payable whenever money changes hands; Universal rate fixed from time to time by Government; Applicable to all transactions between all entities; No exemptions, no floor or ceiling value for transactions. This would capture financial services which are currently exempt from GST, it would apply to charities, and family trusts. It would capture capital gains from the sale of property, shares and other items. It would apply to all transactions made in New Zealand with offshore entities, including so-called internet shopping. Because of its wide reach it would replace and eliminate Personal Income Tax, Company Tax, GST, and sundry other taxes. Because of its wide reach and universality the rate should be low enough to discourage attempts at evasion, and low enough to not seriously impinge on charitable and trust activities. It should also produce the side effect of deflating the shell company structures and nested trusts used to disguise the source and origin of some funds transfers. If the rate is low enough it could attract funds to New Zealand as a "tax haven". This is not a bad thing, so long as all transactions pay the lawful tax at the time. Excise Duty is an anachronism which provoked Cornish fishermen to smuggle French brandy into England, and should be abolished. Alcoholic beverages, fermented or distilled, should be subject to a tax rate which is a logarithmic function of the alcohol content, since higher alcohol content causes multiply higher health harms. All taxes on Alcohol and Tobacco must be paid directly into Vote: Health. Petrol (gasoline) engines run on "distilled motor spirits" and are today also subject to Excise Duty. Diesel fuel is also distilled, but for whatever reason attracts no Excise Duty. Road User Charges might also be applied to electric vehicles, at what rate?. Eliminate this confusion by abolishing all these taxes and charges. Introduce a Tax on Tyres: all road users would pay their fair share, from bicycles to juggernauts, assuming tyre wear approximates road wear. This Tyre Tax must be paid directly to fund roading. These last two can be seen as "user pays" taxes. So too is a Transaction Tax, a tax on the use of money. I urge you to find space in your Terms of Reference to apply these simplifications to the New Zealand Tax system. Peter Kerr 29 April 2018

Submission to the Tax Working Group New Zealand is experiencing widespread hardship, homelessness and poverty, despite being a very wealthy country. There are (as examples) inadequate mental health services, midwifery services and education is expensive and saddles citizens with debt. These difficulties affect much of the population, including people in employment. I personally know many people affected by these problems. A root cause of this is extreme inequality, which I believe is one of New Zealand’s most serious problems. The wealthiest 10% of New Zealanders own around 60% of the nation’s wealth, while the poorest 50% own only 5% (or less) of the nation’s wealth. I do not suggest that people should all be equal – but there would be many benefits from inequality being considerably reduced. For example – we could have the poorest half of New Zealand owning 15% of the nation’s wealth, instead of the current less than 5%. By simple mathematics, transferring 10% of the wealth of the richest 10% of New Zealanders, would allow the poorest 50% to have more than double what they currently have. i.e. 10% x 60% (wealth of the richest 10%) = 6% This transfer would bring profound benefits to a large number of poorer New Zealanders and to the health of our whole society – while the very rich would remain very well-off (e.g. a person with $100m would still have $90m). The idea that reducing tax on the wealthy will stimulate economies has not worked anywhere in the world and can be discarded. There is plenty of evidence that the majority of the population having some wealth (a healthy middle class) and access to education and services, builds economies. Our current tax system allows wealthy people to pay much less tax than poorer people, relative to wealth or income. This is because of the use of regressive taxes such as GST, and also because of very light taxation on capital and capital gains, both of which are mostly accessed by the already- wealthy. The wealthy also have the ability to pay experts to structure their affairs to minimise tax obligations. In my opinion, allowing the wealthy to pay less tax than poorer people relative to their wealth and real income, is unfair, immoral and socially and economically destructive. Recommendations: 1. Taxation should be increased, but exclusively on the wealthiest 10% of citizens. This could be achieved by wealth taxes, capital-gain taxes and highly progressive income taxes. The wealthiest 10% hold the majority of the nation’s wealth and are in an excellent position to cope with an increased tax contribution. This money should be used to improve the situation of the poorest 50+% of New Zealanders. 2. All tax changes should be assessed against effects on inequality. 3. Research should be conducted on the actual tax contribution made by New Zealanders relative to their actual, real income (not IRD-declared income) and current wealth. At present it is not possible to know how much tax people pay relative to actual income and wealth, in part because the wealthy often have little IRD-declared income. I am happy to be contacted regarding my submission. Ben Wybourne, 29/4/18

It is broken in plain sight. New Zealand has gross and increasing inequality in incomes and wealth. The wealthiest are creaming it at the expense of the rest of us. Those on the lowest incomes pay higher proportions of their income in taxation. Tax for the wealthy and super-wealthy is essentially a voluntary activity. The disparity is presented in this image which summarises the ineffectual nature of income tax in meaningfully taxing the incomes of the super-wealthy and the harsh, regressive nature of GST. There are numerous things which must change to redress the gross imbalances in our broken tax system. I am suggesting three changes to make a strong start to bringing fairness and balance to our tax system. • Firstly institute a Financial Transactions Tax (set at around .01%) on all money going through our banking system. This won’t be noticed by people in their day to day living but will bring in significant sums of money from the corporate sector and speculators who move billions in \[1\] and out of New Zealand regularly. This tax would replace GST which is a particularly vicious tax on low incomes. The FTT I am proposing is a broad-based tax, set at a low rate. It would be particularly easy to collect through the banking system. It would have the added value of reducing speculation in the New Zealand dollar (the 10 th most traded currency in the world) which in turn would reduce our dollar’s value and increase income for the goods we sell overseas. • Secondly, a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax which would tax the unearned income of the wealthy and the super-wealthy. Wage and salary earners can’t avoid tax. Wage and salary earners are taxed on every dollar we earn and every dollar we spend. Why does the same not apply to the wealthy and super-wealthy? It is important the income from ALL sources (including capital gains such as property values, shares and dividends) is brought together as taxable income for the purpose of assessing income tax. • Thirdly, we need a much higher top tax rate – currently we have one of the lowest in the world. Why should corporate CEOs pay just 33% income tax on their vastly-inflated salaries when much more is demanded in other countries? (Eg Denmark 55.8%; Australia 49%; USA 46.3%; France 54%; UK 45%) I realise the government has refused to allow such a recommendation as this but the TWG should signal the need for this issue to be addressed urgently by the government. • Fourthly, an Empty Homes Tax be applied to vacant homes. This would be similar to Vancouver’s Empty Homes Tax where 1% of the property value is paid as tax in years when the home is unoccupied for four months or more. More details are here: http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/empty-homes- tax.aspx This tax would bring more vacant properties onto the market (33,000 homes in Auckland were empty in 2016) which would ease rental costs as well as new house prices. It would be a positive, appropriate response to the current housing crisis. I would like to appear before the Tax Working Group to discuss these proposals further and look forward to hearing from you. Na, John Minto \[1\] \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. As a colony and evolving into a welfare state, New Zealanders have never discovered and learned what it is to be a “Free Society.” By Free Society, I am referring to a community that has evolved through the human compunction to trade value for value, and rests on the premise of voluntary association through exercising one’s individual choice, according to the values and individual chooses that will lead to the betterment of his/her life. Freedom is unequivocally the basis for human flourishing. Taxation is the antithesis of freedom. Taxation is the extortion of property, the theft of property, that rightly belongs to the individual who has expended his intellect/labour to manifest the fruits of his endeavours. Property is the extension of an individual’s life. Property belongs to those who produce it. In a Just society, a Man/Woman would be free to trade the value of the fruits of their labour on a voluntary basis for the goods and services of their choosing, according to where they perceive they receive the equivalent or worthy value in return. In a Just society, a Man/Woman would be self-responsible in the investment of their knowledge in order to make choices appropriate for their well-being and thus achieve their full potential over their lifetime, which may include providing for family, contributing to community, and voluntarily trading between other traders who are also endeavoring to achieve their own highest purpose. The result of this free association is property, goods and services for trade, wealth-creation. This is the basis of a ‘Win/Win” society, the result of positive Human Action. Taxation - like all government intervention, is based on the legalized theft of property. Taxation represents a gun at a man’s head with the threat of punishment and damages should he refuse to hand over the property targeted for extortion. Coercion never created anything, it only destroys. The premise of government “right” to extortion and ownership of the property of the citizens under it’s jurisdiction, is entirely Anti-human and TA X W O R K I N G G R O U P - S U B M I S S I O N - 2 9 A P R I L 2 0 1 8 - J U D I T H H I L L will never succeed to promote or provide a society fit for human flourishing - and it never has. History demonstrates in unequivocally truthful visibility, outcomes that range from genocide, murder, wars, poverty on the scale that no individual could ever achieve when left to his own auspices providing for his life. However, governments, unleashing the power of extortion, destruction and theft, are responsible for the most grotesque consequences to mankind. Yet they continue to garner even more power to ravage down this same destructive path towards total annihilation - then have the audacity to blame the consequences on “not enough money to do what we need to do. . . Just let us get our hands on even more of the citizen’s money and we’ll fix everything. . . those bastard industrialists who create CO2 and are ruining the planet.” While the consequences of failed government policies of interference continue rampant and obvious in every society on the planet today, the individual is left more and more impoverished to eek out his bare survival while endeavoring to provide a semblance of comfort for his family. Yet governments double-down on the same failed bromides, vilify the very people who are able to produce products and services that satisfy human needs, and pull the ground out from under the industry and business activities that could generate future prosperity for all. So, the latest New Zealand government committee, working group, taxation evaluation process, is yet another (there have been others before this one, also paid for by extorted wealth wasted) pretense of soliciting citizen’s input to give them some say in how the government will find additional ways to further extort money from their pockets. This is simply a ruse to disguise the fact that the government has NO RIGHT to TAX in the first place. The question should not be: what new taxes shall we come up with, what areas of human activity have we not attached ourselves to, what hidden corners are people securing their money that we have not ferreted out, how much can we get away with this time around before they catch on and vote for a lesser squeeze party? The question should be asked: BY WHAT RIGHT DOES THE GOVERNMENT EXTORT MONEY FROM THE POCKETS OF INDIVIDUALS? When individuals flourish, which they do by the sheer nature of humans to act in support of their survival and well-being, they are also generous, community-minded, humanity-concerned. It is in their rational self-interest to be aware, concerned and act in the best possible interests of all whom they must trade and live with. Contributions to a governing body which individuals elect to represent their wider community interests should be another area where individuals choose voluntarily to associate, to trade value for value. In such a society, there would be excess overflowing into the community - this is a natural outcome of abundance. An elected, representative governing body is merely an organization operating under a strict Constitution that clearly defines the laws and constraints which enable it, as servant to the people, to provide services that extend the ability of individuals to act for their well- being, under the protection of stable: SECURITY SAFETY LAW These three services are the only legitimate functions of any representative government. Anything more than this is a blatant violation of the rights of the individual to provide for his own life. SECURITY - National Defense - the tools, means and resources to ensure that aggression from outside the nation is met with firm, unequivocal, sovereign response to protect the rights of the citizens within the national jurisdiction from interference that could jeopardize his ability to perform his own actions; SAFETY - an internal police force - the tools, means and resources whose right to act is derived from the legal delegation of citizens to allow a third party to act on their behalf in response to violation of any of the law- abiding citizen’s rights and ability to perform their own actions; LAW - a system of OBJECTIVE laws - the basic human protections that underly all human action: the rights of the individual to act in his own self- interest. A system of Laws prescribes the thresholds of incursion between individuals, and prescribes the forfeiture as appropriate for any violations, the forfeiture of property, freedom, plus the requisite compensation to be made to the victims and/or society. AND THAT”S IT. Such services do not cost anything like what it costs today to support the burden and liability of the government that purports to be the omnipotent, omniscient savior for all human weaknesses. Today, the government is based around the outmoded and unchallenged view that ALL HUMANS WILL ACT IN EVIL if the government is not there to stop them. The government has simply replaced GOD as the arbiter of all human activity. By this it treats all humans as SINFUL and INCAPABLE OF LIVING A DECENT LIFE. Just look around the world and one could believe this to be true. HOWEVER, all governments (with the exception of one) have taken this view and it is not a big stretch to see the progression of the debasement of societies as a result - it’s just a matter of degree - the fast or slow road to hell. Venezuela being a recent example from wealth to ruin in a mere decade. And all governments today prescribe the same fatal medicine that they’ve been prescribing for centuries - more enforcement of the initiation of force, more taxation, more interference, more controls, more regulations, more constraints, more restrictions, more trampling over rights, more enforcers, more policies, more redistribution of wealth, less private activity, MORE GOVERNMENT. If, truely, the goal is Human Flourishing on this Earth - GOVERNMENT IS NOT WORKING. One has to wonder then, what is the goal of government intervention - government against the people. We deserve a society based on voluntary association: a FREE SOCIETY. How does a representative government provide the three services outlined, if contributions are VOLUNTARY? By the same methodology that is applied to purchasing Insurance; By a fee on contract agreements around all credit transactions; By lottery; The rational self-interest of all citizens manifests to a willingness to support the representative government services that protect their interests: Security, Safety, Law. \[For a complete summary of how government could be financed in a Free Society, I refer you to: “Government Financing in a Free Society” by Author and Philosopher Ayn Rand.

There should be minimal opportunities for tax avoidance, compliance should be easy and low-cost, and it needs to raise enough money for government to provide services that the population of New Zealand needs. 2.Taxes also have a role to play in incentivising behaviour. That role might be to discourage smoking, encourage companies towards more environmentally-friendly practises, or provide an incentive for New Zealanders to save more. 3.We believe that New Zealand has a good tax system compared to many other OECD countries - in particular its relatively simple approach with few exemptions. However we also think the system could be improved to give a better balance between different taxes and their impacts, and to better meet the challenges of the Page 1 of 7 21st century. Through this submission we look to propose solutions that will edge us closer to a more ideal system. 4.We thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on this important matter. We are happy to be contacted on the matters raised in this submission. We support the use of environmental taxes to incentivise sustainable behaviours 5.We support the use of the tax system to incentivise more environmentally sustainable behaviours, as well as the use of Pigouvian taxes to address activities which produce environmental damage as a negative externality. 6.We note that the primary greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are already included within the emissions trading scheme (ETS). We hope that the ETS will become more effective at reducing the emission of these gases in the future (as the unit price increases and agriculture is included). 7.However, there are a number of other environmental taxes that may merit consideration, from both a revenue-gathering and environmental perspective. 8.Examples from other jurisdictions include: a.taxes intended to reduce emissions from motor vehicles (eg differential car registration costs based on emissions or vehicle age) b.a severance tax on extracted fossil fuels (coal would be particularly relevant in the New Zealand context). We support introducing a charge for water use 9.We support introducing a pricing system for water. This would acknowledge the importance of this resource critical to all life, as well as its increasing scarcity. 10.The current water allocation system does not adequately incentivise efficient and effective use of water. It also enables environmentally unsustainable behaviours, such as extensive use of irrigation to support dairying in areas where it would not otherwise be possible. While we acknowledge the importance of the dairy sector to the New Zealand economy, expansion of dairying to such marginal landscapes must be balanced against other impacts, such as the depletion of our natural capital. 11.We note that the Labour Party campaigned for a ‘water tax’, but that this was not progressed following the coalition agreement with New Zealand First. We therefore support the introduction of a water tax after the current term of parliament, once the coalition agreement has expired. We support a capital gains tax 12.We believe that income derived from capital should be subject to tax, to the same degree that income derived from labour is. The absence of a capital gains tax is the most obvious missing component of the New Zealand taxation system, in particular compared to other OECD countries. 13.The current approach to (not) taxing capital relative to other income sources distorts the playing field by incentivising investment in sectors that are not subject to taxation (eg capital gains from property) at the expensive of investment in sectors that are taxed. This results in adverse outcomes such as our overheated property market. Page 2 of 7 14.Introducing a capital gains tax could incentivise greater investment in productive sectors and direct more capital to the sharemarket and other private enterprise, thereby supporting the growth of New Zealand businesses. 15.We strongly support introducing a capital gains tax as a key step towards a more equitable tax system. We support progressive income tax and advocate for a tax-free bottom bracket 16.Personal income tax should remain progressive, as this means that those with a greater capacity to pay contribute more to the services funded by taxation. 17.Further, we recommend that the income tax system be made more progressive by introducing a tax-free bracket. We suggest that income up to $10,000 should be tax free. This would reduce the tax burden for those on low incomes. It would also partially offset the regressive impact of GST. 18.The reduction in revenue to government could be compensated for by a new top income tax bracket. 19.We believe that tax rates should be aligned between the top income bracket and the rate for trusts to prevent tax avoidance. Ideally, the rate for the the top income bracket and the company rate should be aligned for the same reason but we also believe that this should be only one consideration among many when deciding on the rate. We don’t advocate for alignment between the top income rate and company rate at this time. 20.Tax brackets should be indexed to the CPI or an equivalent wage index to prevent bracket creep and prevent a person’s income from falling into a higher tax bracket if their nominal income goes up but real income goes down. We favour retaining the status quo for GST 21.The current Goods and Services Tax appears to be working effectively in gathering revenue for government. 22.We support the current New Zealand approach of very few exemptions to the application of the GST. We note that New Zealand’s value-added tax is more effective than value-added taxes in most jurisdictions, which often apply exemptions that decrease the effectiveness of the tax in gathering revenue and can significantly increase its complexity and administration costs. 23.We acknowledge that GST is inherently a regressive tax, and on this basis would not support increasing the current rate any further. 24.On the other hand, some evidence suggests that a small decrease in the level of GST would not decrease prices for goods and services in proportion to the rate of the cut, as retailers and service providers are likely to retain a proportion of the gains for themselves. Page 3 of 7 We favour retaining the current company tax rate and do not support introducing differentiated tax rates for companies 25.We are aware that discussions around the company tax rate are complex and hotly contested. It is important to separate ideology from what is actually supported by evidence. 26.It is suggested that reducing the company tax rate would incentivise businesses to invest further in measures that would help them grow, as they will be able to keep a greater proportion of the profits. From our research, it appears that this assertion has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. If there are activities which would increase a business’s profitability, it is reasonable to assume that they would be likely to undertake these measures anyway (unless there is a very high level of company tax). 27.Another argument is that companies will be in a better position to pay their workers more if they generate more profits. This seems a dubious claim - it’s hard to see why a company would be likely to pay workers more rather than, for example, returning a greater dividend to its shareholders. 28.Reducing the rate of company tax would have a distributional impact, with the gains disproportionately realised by wealthier people, while ceteris paribus other groups would have to pay more tax to make up the government’s reduced revenue from this tax source. 29.It is argued that reducing the company tax rate could help attract companies to locate in New Zealand. We think this is unlikely. A range of factors influence company location decisions. The tax rate would have to be cut substantially before it had a material impact in attracting companies to New Zealand. 30.The most compelling argument in favour of reducing the company tax rate may be its potential impact on retaining companies in New Zealand. That is, if our company tax rate is significantly out of line with comparator countries, this may incentivise some types of companies to relocate their businesses in jurisdictions with a lower company tax rate. However, it should be noted that only a small proportion of businesses are mobile in this way - in particular, small and medium-sized businesses would be quite unlikely to relocate, as would large companies whose business is inherently tied to New Zealand for either geographic reasons (eg Fonterra) or because that is where the company provides its services (eg Spark). In addition, while New Zealand’s current company tax rate is now relatively high compared to the OECD average, it is hardly an outlier. 31.On balance, we can’t see any compelling reason to lower the rate of company tax. 32.On the other hand, we also do not favour increasing the rate. Increasing the rate would act as a negative signal to businesses, and in the longer term could mean that New Zealand does become an outlier - especially if other jurisdictions continue to reduce their company tax rates. 33.We do not support introducing differentiated company tax rates. We understand that the intention of such an approach would be to support small and medium-sized businesses. However such an approach could have unintended impacts, such as incentivising companies being structured to avoid this tax. It is also hard to say where Page 4 of 7 the incidence of a company tax will fall - meaning that the higher rate could have unexpected adverse impacts. Saving for your retirement should be further incentivised 34.According to Statistics New Zealand projections, the proportion of the population aged 65+ is expected to increase dramatically. In 2016, there were 4.4 people aged 15-64 for every person aged 65 and over. By 2068, that ratio is expected to drop to 2 people. 35.This illustrates the need to encourage people to pursue their own retirement savings, with Kiwisaver the ideal vehicle for that. 36.Gearing more incentives towards saving will introduce more capital into New Zealand markets while helping New Zealanders save for a more financially secure retirement. 37.To improve the effectiveness of Kiwisaver as a vehicle for retirement savings, we suggest that the annual PIE tax that a Kiwisaver fund incurs is deferred to when a saver withdraws their money rather than on an annual basis. 38.This will leave more funds in a Kiwisaver account and allow for greater compound growth. This will leave savers with a higher savings balance by the time they retire. While this will result in reduced revenue for the government, we deem this to be an acceptable trade-off. 39.We also suggest changes to the Kiwisaver scheme so it becomes closer to how it was originally designed. These suggested changes are all about encouraging people to save: a.The $1000 kickstart should be reintroduced, to provide an incentive for people to join, and to provide a good base to start with so that initial investment gains aren’t cancelled out by fixed fees. b.The member tax credit should also be bought back up to its $1042.86 level, though we should retain the rate we have now so that someone will need to contribute $2085.72 annually to get the full credit -- or about $40 a week. c.The mandatory employer match should be increased to 6%, though allow the option for someone to remain on 3% (with an employer match of 3%) if they wish. We support giving local governments greater flexibility to introduce new types of funding mechanisms 40.We note that the Tax Working Group is not considering changes to local government taxation in New Zealand, but still would like to express our views on this topic. 41.Many local governments across New Zealand are experiencing considerable funding pressures as they struggle to deal with rapid growth and the corresponding demand for infrastructure. The current rates system appears insufficient to deal with ongoing funding pressures, and ratepayers are understandably opposed to ongoing double-digit rates increases. 42.We support allowing local governments greater flexibility to introduce new funding mechanisms to support their activities. A good example is the proposed ‘bed tax’ in Queenstown, which would help the town to better address its considerable Page 5 of 7 infrastructure deficit and acknowledges the challenge of its low rate-payer base relative to the number of visitors. 43.On the other hand, this flexibility should be balanced against the potential negative impact of creating differentiation in systems between regions, thereby generating higher compliance costs for businesses and individuals working across different regions. On these grounds, we would oppose the introduction of local sales taxes, for example. 44.We recommend that the Working Group recommend to the Government that it grant local jurisdictions greater flexibility to introduce tailored funding measures appropriate to their challenges and needs. We would support a wealth tax if implementation challenges could be mitigated 45.Wealth in New Zealand is more unequally distributed than income. People with more assets and capital are able to use these to generate returns, thereby further increasing inequality over the longer term. 46.In principle, we agree that a wealth tax could address this cycle of growing inequality. In practice, we think there could be challenges to implementing such a tax effectively. For instance, people will be incentivised to structure their assets to avoid this tax. It will also be challenging to implement for people with less liquid assets, as they may not have the funds available to pay the tax on an annual basis. 47.If these challenges and others could be satisfactorily resolved, we would support the introduction of a wealth tax. A land tax could work, but we think other options are preferable 48.A land tax would provide a transparent system (as land ownership is already well recorded) with few opportunities for tax avoidance. Another benefit of a land tax could be reduced land-banking (thereby freeing up more land for development). 49.On the other hand, a land tax could impose hardship on people who are ‘land rich, capital poor’, who may ultimately have to sell their property in order to pay the tax. The exemption for the land under the family home from the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference would go some way to addressing this challenge. There is also a risk that landlords may pass the cost of a land tax directly on to tenants, thereby increasing rents for those who are less able to afford it. 50.While we are open to the idea of a well-implemented land tax, we think other options (such as environmental taxes and a comprehensive capital gains tax) would be preferable as revenue sources. An inheritance tax and gift duty could be effective but we don’t consider them priorities 51.An inheritance tax could be an effective mechanism for reducing inequality by decreasing the number of people who become wealthy simply by inheriting assets or money, rather than through their own work or investments. We do acknowledge that such a tax can be subject to avoidance, for example by securing assets in trusts. We note that inheritance tax is excluded from the scope of the Tax Working Group. Page 6 of 7 52.A gift duty could also be useful to reduce inequality, as it would help ensure that people become wealthy through their own endeavours, as opposed to perpetuating existing inequality by wealthier people gifting land (or other assets) to their children. A gift duty would be most effective in combination with an inheritance tax, as the two are a logical pair. 53.If introduced, a gift duty should have a suitably high threshold to ensure that it is targeted in a way that maximises its impact while not affecting the considerable majority of New Zealanders. 54.While a gift duty could be effective, we do not consider it a priority. A global approach is needed for the tax treatment of multinationals and for a financial transactions tax 55.We believe that these two different issues are linked by the need for a global approach rather than being addressed at a national level. Legislation at a national level may prove ineffective so we generally support that New Zealand participates in global agreements to provide a global framework for addressing these challenges. 56.With multinationals, we recognise that it can be complex to determine the local profitability of a company that operates globally (such as Facebook or Google). However the current system which permits the shifting of profits from a New Zealand entity to one overseas does not resemble fairness. It’s absurd that a company making large margins on a global level makes tiny margins on a local level (and therefore has a tiny tax bill) thanks to some accounting magic. This means that multinationals can avoid paying appropriate tax despite earning considerable profits in New Zealand. 57.If there are some policy instruments available to the New Zealand government then we’d support these, but think ultimately that approaching the issue with a global perspective will be the most effective. 58.We support a financial transaction tax to provide a more broad-based tax system. 59.The rate should be set a low enough level that the average person barely notices the impact of the tax but high enough to gather sufficient tax revenue on aggregate to make it a worthwhile endeavour. Due to the global nature of financial markets, we think this will be best achieved through a global agreement.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to tax working group on tax system There are problems the tax system could address There is rising wealth inequality which is helped along by the tax system. The tax system does favour investment in housing over putting money in the bank and other forms of investment – because of the fact real estate can be highly leveraged and the fact there is no adjustment for inflation in the tax system (which may well be a nightmare to implement). Higher income tax rates are counter-productive While it may equitable to tax higher income earners more, higher income tax rates over the current top rate of 33% tend to raise very little revenue because they encourage tax avoidance and there are relatively few of the so called high income earners, which nowadays might be people earning over $120,000 a year. Furthermore many of the wealthiest people earn income that is non-taxable in their hands such as capital gains, superannuation and trust distributions. Capital gains taxes don’t work Putting aside short term speculation which is already caught under the current tax system, taxing capital gains that might not happen until 20 years or more in the future would likely cause more problems than it solves. For a start, the gain due to inflation over a 20 year period will be considerable so a house rising only at the rate of inflation would have a considerable capital gain. For example if inflation was 2% a year after 20 years a house purchased for $100,000 would be worth $148, 595 if it appreciated only at the rate of inflation – giving a potential taxable gain of $48, 595! To tax this gain would be a huge impost and unfair. Secondly the prospect of the tax far away in the future is unlikely to impact human behaviour. Property investors currently are clearly investing for the capital gain in many instances because the investment otherwise does not stand up -it is often not earning sufficient cashflow to even cover costs and financing. I have had Auckland property investors telling me their rental properties are a cash drain but they are prepared to accept that because the good location means in the end they will get a great capital gain. Telling them the big gain might be taxed 20 years down the track is unlikely to discourage them. The tax system is always being changed so there is no certainty a tax imposed now will even be around in 20 years, and who knows what rate might apply then! This probably explains why capital gains taxes appear to have had virtually no effect on slowing down runaway housing markets. Financing arrangements should not affect tax liability How an investment is financed should not affect the taxes imposed on it. Why should a person borrowing a large amount to buy a business pay less tax than one who saved up and didn’t borrow anything? Allowing interest payments to be deductible is a distortion that also allows various tax rorts that can stop multi-nationals with related party loans from paying company tax in New Zealand. Stopping interest from being deductible would level the playing field between putting money in the bank and investing in real estate. Savers putting money in the bank would get taxed on their interest income and property investors would pay tax on their net rental income after taking into account normal property expenses but not the interest on any loan taken to buy the property because they didn’t have sufficient of their own money to buy it. Stopping interest deductibility for tax purposes is something that has been advocated by the Economist magazine: https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21651220-most-western-economies-sweeten-cost- borrowing-bad-idea-senseless-subsidy https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21716050-would-be-risky-time-fiddle- tax-code-what-if-interest-expenses Anthony Morris 28 April 2018

Barry Coates E-mail: Submission to the Tax Working Group Barry Coates – independent researcher Introduction I make this submission as an independent citizen. The views are mine alone. By way of introduction, I have an undergraduate degree in Economics and a Masters in Management from Yale. I have worked in government, private sector, academia and NGOs, including as Executive Director of Oxfam New Zealand 2003-14. I was a Green Party list MP 2016-17. I have read the background paper and appreciate the work and thought that has gone into this Inquiry. I apologise for the brief submission but would be pleased to add rationale or answer any questions. Purposes of a good tax system The Background paper cites the central purpose of taxation to “to provide sufficient revenue to the Government to fund the provision of public goods, services, and transfers.” However, the role of the State in building the four capitals and adding value to the economy is under-stated in this definition. Research has shown the important role played by the State in innovation and developing new technologies 1 . The central role of the State should also include ‘building capital and resilience for the future’. Design of the Tax System The current tax system should be reformed to play an explicit role in correcting failures of the financial system in the following ways: 1. To internalise externalities, such as environmental costs externalised onto others, in accordance with the Polluter Pays Principles. New measures should include: • A carbon tax that is predictable, stable and increases over time (a carbon tax is preferred to the ETS because of the lack of predictability for investors, and the lack of public credibility in the ETS) • Pollution taxes levied on older model cars and other vehicles (recognising the health costs from emissions as well as greenhouse gas emissions) • Congestion charges for heavily used roads, on the condition that transport alternatives (such as public transport) is available and affordable • Taxes on the pollution of freshwater (such as a tax on over-use of nitrogenous fertilisers) and the marine environment (such as a price for plastic bags and refundable charge on drink containers) 1 Mazzucato, Mariana. The Entrepreneurial State. 2013. Anthem Press \[1\] • Taxes on the use of scarce resources (such as high quality groundwater) • Tourism levies and charges on heavily use tourism attractions The OECD has commented on the low incidence of environmental taxes, and recommended their more extensive use in New Zealand 2 . 2. To modify behaviour that creates costs for society, such as taxation on: • soft drinks and other products that contribute to obesity and high public health costs • excessive use of packaging by manufacturers and retailers • gambling that creates social problems (eg. pokie machines) • use of alcohol and legal drugs • environmental externalities, such as those in 1 above 3. To provide the right signals that encourage productive investment and to discourage speculation and unproductive activity: • a comprehensive capital gains tax to provide a level playing field with income from other sources • a capital gains tax on the family home should be included, with a sliding scale that reduces to zero after 10 years of ownership (I realise this is not in the scope of the Working Group) • a small Financial Transactions Tax on capital movements (in lieu of the lack of GST levied on financial transactions) • taxes on land-banking and other forms of speculation 4. To improve equality through the introduction of wealth taxes and the introduction of a higher tax rate: • A tax-free threshold should be applied to wealth taxes, set at a level sufficient to exclude savings for the average retirement • The family home should be included (I realise this is not in the scope of the Working Group) • A higher tax rate should be introduced at a higher income tax band (eg. >$150,000), with regulation to prevent the transfer of income to trusts in order to reduce tax incidence 5. To support dignity and human rights through greater universality of support for citizens on low incomes: • Build on universal superannuation through the greater use of entitlements to provide support for others in need, including children, rather than the current onerous and intrusive systems of compliance • Introduce a tax free threshold above the living income to avoid the current situation of taxation being levied on citizens receiving benefits • Move towards a guaranteed level of income for all citizens through integrated tax and welfare approaches International Tax International action for tax cooperation that extends beyond BEPS to include consistent and fair systems of tax internationally, and to avoid a race to the bottom: 2 OECD. Environmental Performance in New Zealand. 2017 • An end to tax havens and the ability of wealthy individuals and corporations to evade fair tax • Stronger provisions on multinationals evading tax through transfer pricing • Stronger provisions on multinationals in defining the taxable value added in each country • New regulations on the digital economy to ensure fair tax is paid (including GST on all online imports of goods from abroad) • Full tax credit for NZ investors in Australia (for franking credits) Taxation of charities Charities play a crucial role in New Zealand society and the current exemption from tax is appropriate in most cases. In some cases, charities are supported through enterprises that compete in a commercial environment. Essentially, the tax treatment is similar whether the income is tax free to the charity, or when a profit-making enterprise donates all their profits to charity. So the current rules are appropriate. Those who may have concern over the current treatment of income by organisations such as Sanitarium should direct their concerns at whether the enterprise should be defined as a charity.

New Zealand’s Situation After 80 Years of Tax and Spend Welfare 1. Retirement Debt A. $850 billion dollars owed by government to New Zealanders of working age and the retired (3½ times GDP). B. This debt is growing by $12-13 billion a year. C. By 2060 this debt will exceed $1,350 billion (i.e., one trillion+). D. If the Private Sector kept their books like the government does, directors could end up in prison for fraud. E. New Zealand is well on the way to going broke. F. The $850 billion debt should be entered as a liability in the government balance sheet. 2. Fiscal Position – A deficit of 3-4% of GDP, not a surplus as claimed once the increase in retirement debt for year is included (13 billion dollars). 3. Government Budgets – Often by implication include provision for future welfare payments without the income to pay for them (future superannuation and health liabilities). 4. Dependency – A cycle which encourages some people to look to the state for support when they could be making it on their own. 5. Productivity – Low productivity compared to most OECD nations (→ low wages). 6. Inequality – Bottom 50%+ of NZ’ers own almost nothing (5% total wealth). 7. Institutions – Government institutions failing miserably: A. Education – limited choice, falling standards, poor discipline. 40% leave schools with insufficient skills. B. Retirement - 50% + of retirees have little or no capital/savings. - Number of workers to retirees is shrinking. C. Health – Limited choice, long waiting lists, staffing problems, bureaucratic, inefficiency, rapid cost increases. D. Welfare dependency hurts the poor most leading to inadequate housing, bad parenting, monopoly supply; low self-esteem. 8. Power – Has been taken away from individual NZ’ers in many cases. 9. Con Game – Politicians take your money (tax) as quietly as possible and then give it back with as much fanfare as possible on so-called free education, free healthcare etc. 10. Politicians – Create dependency in order to win votes (Labour on welfare and Education; National on business and farming). 11. Privilege – Governments provide hand-outs to favoured corporates and the middle-class (and then ask low-income earners to pay unnecessary taxes as a result) 12. Taxation – High taxation via bracket creep hoping people will not notice. 13. Incentives – Are often poor and getting worse. 14. Capture – Institutional capture where money often goes to the benefit of the institution or providers not pupils or patients (health 2004-2009). 15. Resource Distribution – Within the social services is often of a ridiculous nature (based on political decision-making not user demand.) 16. Housing & Infrastructure – Both disaster areas. New Zealand’s Situation Recommendations − Principles  Each generation should pay for itself.  Each person – each family should, as far as possible, pay/provide for themselves. Government should help them get in a position to do so.  Fairness – every New Zealander, as far as possible, should be provided with the same opportunities to save.  Security – provided by having the means to look after self and family.  Privilege – remove government privileges (hand-outs) that go to business and higher income earners (corporate welfare, tertiary education).  Power – return it to individual New Zealanders wherever possible.  Competition – wherever possible.  Fiscally sound – policy must be fiscally sound over the long term.  Resource use – social policy that encourages resources to move to areas of greatest need.  Goals – government required to outline goals (i.e., what they are trying to achieve).  Protection – of most vulnerable a top priority of all policy. 2 New Zealand’s Situation Recommendations − Policy  A tax-free income of $52,000 for single taxpayers or $65,000 for one-income families.  A tax of 24 cents in the dollar on income above $52,000.  A corporate tax rate of 20 cents in the dollar.  Yearly savings of $18,200 per year on incomes above $52,000, slightly less for those on incomes below $52,000 (Super $6,240, Health and Risk $11,960).  Savings paid for by tax reductions 50% (9,100), employer 35.7% (6,500), individual 14.3% (2,600).  Savings and contributions indexed to an appropriate index.  A guaranteed minimum income for low-income families (replacing working for families).  Healthcare – Savings - $8,660 each year (inflation adjusted to go into individual’s Health Fund). - $12,480 each year to go into one-income families’ Health Fund.  Healthcare – Expenditure - A chronically ill fund to be established with contributions from savers and government.  Healthcare – Expenditure - A catastrophic insurance policy to be taken out each year by every New Zealander for events costing $20,000 or more.  Healthcare – A government underwrite.  Healthcare during retirement - objective to retire with a fund of at least $80,000 (real) after 25 years, $150,000 after 40 years of contributions. Balance at death goes to surviving spouse / estate.  Superannuation - $6,240 savings per year (indexed to wages). - Savings (earning a real 4%) likely to have a fund size of $750,000 after tax on retirement given 40-50 years of employment.  Risk Cover (unemployment, sickness and accident compensation) - $3,300 savings a year. - A catastrophic insurance policy to be taken out each year. - A government underwrite. - No variance in rate of pay-out if out of work (e.g., ACC same as sickness). - Any balance in account on retirement goes into individual’s Health Account.  Education - an education tax credit for every child whose family wants it.  Housing and Infrastructure - Use 10% of net yearly savings two billion dollars for housing and infrastructure. - Policies to ensure sufficient land is zoned for section development.  Out of Work Beneficiaries - Special training for those who need it (compulsory). - Reformed management structure for out of work area. 3 Outcomes of Recommendations As Savings replace 80 years of Tax and Spend Welfare 1. Retirement Debt A. $30 billion (indexed) gross savings each year stops the rot and ultimately solves the problem. B. Net savings offsets growth in debt from year one and starts to offset existing debt within 10 years. C. By year 2060 savings for future welfare spending exceed $600 billion (offsetting debt owed to retired). D. Government financial accounts now mirror what the private sector has to do. 2. Fiscal Position A. A small surplus ½% of GDP in year one instead of a deficit of 3.4% of GDP today. B. A turnaround in year one of 3½% of GDP ($9 billion). C. Fiscal position improves year-on-year to be $20 billion better off in 20 years’ time, relative to where it will be under today’s policy. 3. Government – Government budgets are now fully funded for future welfare commitments. 4. Productivity – Lower taxes, savings, lower debt, competition & individual decision-making add to productivity improvements over time. 5. Inequality A. A turnaround in inequality starts day one. B. Individuals in work now save $6,240 for Super & $11,960 gross for health & risk (Twice this amount for 2 income families). C. A 20 year old who worked every year until retirement would likely retire with $1 million+ (Super), plus $100,000-$200,000 in their health a/c compared to savings of almost nothing today. 6. Institutions A. Educational choice and an education tax credit available for every child whose family would like one. B. In retirement, New Zealanders would receive not only the existing pension but a lump sum super & health savings a/c. C. Health – Choice & competition largely solve the waiting list & staffing problems while efficiency improves as it did with SOEs. D. Welfare improves as self-provision/decision-making largely remove dependency. 7. Power – Moves away from politicians and is transferred back to individual NZ’ers who now spend their own money. – Politicians’ role is to act as regulator & insurer of last resort. 8. Con Game – Politicians no longer take your money from you – you save your own money ($18,200 a year + interest earned) & buy your own insurance cover or pay directly for services you wish to buy. 9. Politicians – No longer able to create dependency in order to win votes. – They no longer spend your money, you do. 10. Privilege – Government hand-outs amounting to $6-7 billion have been removed which is a large part of the reason why a 20-year old will retire with a million dollars in their pocket, a 40-year old $400,000+ in their super and health fund accounts. 11. Taxation – Low – no tax on first $52,000 of income ($65,000 single income families) and 24c on income above $52,000. No bracket creep. 4 12. Incentives – Improved low marginal tax rates. – Rewards in the system to stay healthy & in a job. 13. Capture – No longer possible when New Zealanders have choice and there is competition in the social service marketplace (instead of compulsory government delivery). 14. Resource Distribution – Distribution of social services will be determined by individual New Zealander’s purchasing decisions, not politicians’ decision-making or provider capture. 15. Housing and Infrastructure – $3 billion of government investment (via savings accounts) along with regulatory changes will, over a 5-10 year period, help solve today’s housing & infrastructure disaster. 5

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Taxation Review Submission By Christina Humphreys/ Email: In troduction; The Taxation review in NZ should be across the board to consider the huge inequality between the average income of middle NZ and the very high cost of living in this country and widening. So please do not look to increasing the tax take from Middle class working people in NZ. This is where the largest tax take comes from now \[PAYE\] , to fund the Social system in our country. Surprisingly the GST does not contribute a huge amount to the system. You have many other avenues to collect from and I will note some of them below! Recently I produced a paper for Grey Power ‘Thirty years on from Rogernomics’ and how we ‘Baby Boomers’ recovered to enable some of us to buy a home again and set ourselves up for retirement. This has just got very much harder as time has gone on, because the gap has widened between the low and average wage income and the cost of living. On the Numbeo CPI index NZ rates as the 11th highest in the world for our cost of living \[Two above Australia\]. After 1986 when the ‘Rogernomics’ Labour policies devastated this country a vast number were made unemployed, so many went overseas to get jobs. Many are coming home now to retire and are faced with the Section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964, which tells many they are not eligible for the NZ pension unless they are back in the country at least 5 years prior to 65 years of age, that’s if they are a NZ citizen. NZ does insist on making life difficult for our own people! Yet we seem very happy to give the pension to foreigners who have never paid a dollar into our tax system! How about the Working committee look at blocking the ‘Family unification’? This Law that enables old parents of foreigners living here to come in and receive the pension immediately, never having paid a dollar into our system. That would achieve a few million a year to pay toward our infrastructure. \[1\] \[1\] 1.a. The review committee needs to look elsewhere to increasing more tax, but not to developing a lot more tax systems and making life more complex. NZ is tripping over ourselves with PC rules and regulations and compliance costs, the average Kiwi cannot handle anymore. b. There needs to be a more effective way of measuring and controlling our inflation rate? We supposedly have a low inflation rate yet everything day to day we purchase seems to go up in price, food and fuel would be the worst offender. c. Many of us Pensioners thought we had saved enough money to retire on, but a recent article stated in ‘ten years we will have spent our money’ and they are not wrong there with the cost of living in NZ, we cannot afford to live here! d. For pensioners and low-income earners the Committee needs to seriously consider removing taxation from the bottom $17,000 income. To allow this low-level income earners to survive in NZ high cost of living environment. 2. I will note some avenues for the Committee to consider taking more tax from instead of middle NZ; a. Charitable Trusts; The two main ones that spring to mind are Maori Charitable Trusts and Sanatarium Charitable Trust. These entities pay no tax at all, this is obscene particularly on the business side of these Trust, where they make huge profits and pay no tax, this is so wrong. Its very easy for organisations like this who have been given large sums of money to turn a profit, but they should pay tax on that profit equal to what the rest of us pay. The Committee needs to consider a way these entities pay tax. b. Maori Authorities, only pay 17% tax rate this is also wrong, and it should be the same rate as the rest of NZ pays. c. ACC is another big entity that the NZ people have paid into/funded and receive very little benefit from any more, many people are turned away on legitimate claims now. This large entity has the largest investment portfolio in NZ. Investment portfolio value $36.6 million and ACC payments for accidents etc. is $55 million, but Company investments are making millions https://www.acc.co.nz/assets/corporate-documents/acc7811-annual-report- 2017.pdf It is saying here its behaviour is ethical, but many of us believe ACC is in the business of financial investing and has lost its way, neglecting their core business and not looking after kiwis who have had accidents etc. Kiwis should not be paying such high ACC charges, if ACC has this sort of money to invest then the government should be taxing this company more! Once again this is middle NZ that has funded this huge financial entity with few benefits. The only good thing you can say is that it has invested most of the money in NZ. Is all this ethical? ACC Ethical Investment; \[quote\] ACC works closely with the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation, the Government Superannuation Fund Authority and the National Provident Fund on all aspects of ethical investment and is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (see www.unpri.org). In addition to carrying out its own investment activities in an ethical manner, ACC avoids directly investing in entities that are engaged in activities that would be regarded as unethical by a substantial majority of the New Zealand public. ACC takes the laws of New Zealand to be a reflection of those principles that are widely held by the New Zealand public. Hence ACC seeks to avoid investing in entities that engage in activities that would be illegal if they occurred in New Zealand. ACC also avoids investing in companies involved in the production of tobacco, recognising that while tobacco is still legal in New Zealand, it is greatly discouraged by New Zealand public policy. Note that in the table below \[on website\], the largest holding is now an unlisted investment, in Kiwi Group Holdings, the parent company of Kiwibank. ACC and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund jointly made an investment in Kiwi Group Holdings in October 2016 and contributed further capital to Kiwi Group Holdings in April 2017. ACC views Kiwi Group Holdings as a long-term investment. Aside from the investment in Kiwi Group Holdings, and ACC’s equity investments in Wellington Gateway Partnership (which is building the Transmission Gully expressway north of Wellington) and NX2 (which is building the Puhoi to Warkworth motorway), all of ACC’s top-50 equity investments are held in companies or trusts that are listed on public stock exchanges, which provides us with current market values of these investments. The only individual credit exposures representing more than 1% of the reserves portfolio (ie $366 million) are to the New Zealand Government, the Local Government Funding Agency, four banking groups with strong credit ratings and New Zealand banking licences, the Auckland Council and a AAA-rated development bank guaranteed by the German government. None of ACC’s direct property investments represents more than 0.5% of the reserves portfolio. ACC’s largest property investment is a Wiri property leased to The Warehouse for its North Island distribution centre. This property is valued at $160 million D. It's Time to Get Tough with Tax Dodging Transnationals This is another group the Working Committee needs to seriously look at getting tax from! This Is Not Just About One Bad Apple! For several years now, the New Zealand media have drawn attention to the scandalously low amount of tax paid in this country by some of the biggest transnational corporations (TNCs) in the world, particularly the digital economy giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon. Tax dodging on a truly epic scale is common across all transnational corporations around the world, including in this country. The previous National government was loath to do anything about it. In its final few months in power, it did introduce some tweaks around the edges but shied away from a diverted profits tax, which has been implemented in both Australia and Britain to penalise transnationals caught manipulating the tax system. For instance, in 2016, it was reported that Facebook had paid $43,000 in tax the previous financial year - about the same as "a mid-range doctor or lawyer", as the media pointed out. Tax dodging by transnationals is not confined to New Zealand. Basically, it has all been put in the too hard basket. This promptly led to some major countries deciding to take unilateral action. India has already imposed a 6% “equalisation tax” on digital advertising sold by Google and Facebook. The European Commission (EC) announced it will impose a 3% tax on the revenues of transnationals such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Uber and Airbnb. The EC announced that this 3% tax is an interim step, pending a longer-term measure. So, what is this country \[NZ\] doing about it??? E. Regional Councils and its huge waste of money, restructure required. Working committee needs to suggest restructure here, would save millions. Something National was going to do, but never achieved, just a big Corporation that wastes massive amounts of NZ people’s money, because it employs so many people they have to be continually dreaming up more compliance systems and costs for the people to justify their existence. Tauranga RC alone has three very large buildings here full of people that we middle NZ pay for. Working Committee need to target this money wasting Entity! F. Immigrants. Why is our Tax Dept not policing more of these people with their cash businesses? Many of these people only deal in cash and certainly do not furnish a full set of accounts to pay their full dues of tax. This is another very large avenue, for tax that is not being collected. Conclusion; The above entity’s I have mentioned if they were taxed in the way they should be, this would afford the country a huge amount of money to help correct the situation of paying for such necessities as Health and Education, which are badly underfunded. When NZ has massive waste elsewhere! I do not believe we should go down the track of Capital gains tax, wealth tax and other such taxes, another stream of setting up and costs. We already have a partial Capital gains tax in NZ anyway, if a person sells too many properties, NZ can tax people on the profit made on these sales. The other argument here is if kiwis were allowed a reasonable living wage they wouldn’t be so quick to be looking for other avenues like selling property for capital gain. The Average Kiwi is not given a decent wage to be able to afford to pay off a house before retirement, so they must look for other income streams other than leaving the country to work elsewhere for better money. Immigrants, NZ needs to cut the immigration numbers coming here, they are totally overloading our infrastructure and some how do not seem to be helping pay for the update of our infrastructure. NZ does have options other than more additional complex tax systems!

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group set up by the Government Sir Michael Cullen and your Fellow Members, A general comment: New Zealanders already pay a substantial amount in tax. Governments need to become more disciplined in their spending, honest in admitting any increase in what is taken from an individual is a tax and stop under estimating the power of a good education coupled with the power of Public opinion. The summary of my submissions are: 1. Stop the tax creep that insidiously erodes the take home pay of wage earners. 2. Reduce company tax rates and make them the same for large or small companies 3. Close the loop hole that allows Charitable Businesses tax exemptions even when the funds are not directly used to benefit the charity. 4. I am opposed to a capital Gains tax 5. Maori Authorities should be taxed at the same rate as all companies. 6. Any environmental tax proposals should be sector neutral 7. GST should remain structured as it is. Expanding on the summary: 1. Our society used to function well on a good days work for a good days pay, this needs to be encouraged. An increasing trend world wide is more people voting for Governments that distribute more in the way of benefits. This is mistaken ideology and leads to dependency and dissatisfaction. All of which erodes the ethos of the individual entrepreneur or work ethic so important to a balanced life. The benefit from a good take home pay is immeasurable, it allows the growth in Self esteem, allows choice and a chance to adopt a healthy life style. We will live longer and this will become extremely important. It is dishonest of any Government to continue what is known as “Bracket Creep” eroding what is rightfully an individuals take home pay without asking the tax payers of New Zealanders if they agree. Other Nations have done this very successfully. By being honest it will stop any future Government making false “play” from tax cuts. 2. We need to encourage industry, new investment that is determined by the market place not Government directed or influenced, to identify and expand new opportunities and provide work for any age group that is fit and able. Not having work available at a good rate of pay, balanced with encouragement to work, will eventually destroy the fabric on which our society is built. Increasing productivity is essential. 3. Some of these organisations are huge businesses competing on an unlevelled playing field with full tax paying companies. They are able to accumulate huge assets with only a small proportion going back to the people they claim to represent. I thought “Political Lobbying” would see their status abolished. 4. Keep the tax system simple. Even exempting the home from Capital Gains tax has not been proved overseas to benefit anyone; it certainly has not reduced house prices long term. People need to be encouraged to invest in productive assets that will benefit New Zealand. 5. NZ has made enormous settlements to Maori and indeed many Tribes now own some of our biggest companies. I believe New Zealanders have been very fair in their acceptance of this directional payment but from now on we need to all pull our weight equally. 6. Politicians should not be given the chance to ideologically favour certain entities within a sector. Farmers are making huge personal investments on their land to improve the environment, let the marketing company make this call as to days consumer is very discerning. Individuals with their choice of vehicles, recycling and reduction of wastage are starting to make an impact. Individuals are collecting like minded people to gather and clear the ocean of plastic, funded philanthropically. The advent of electric vehicles is exciting. People understand the advantages over fossil fuelled motors. It took five years in America to change from horse drawn vehicles to the motor car as new opportunities were appreciated. This will not be so dramatic but as technology improves, volumes will increase and the price will drop Do not underestimate education and the power of public opinion. We are seeing this with health and the willingness to reduce sugar, increase exercise and take control of ones destiny. How many cars do you see on the road today with a bike carrier on the back? 10 years ago you would count them on one hand. Taxes are expensive to operate and implement and there is a reluctance to remove any imposed tax take. 7. A simple tax on the consumer that has proved effective over time. As much as I hate paying a tax on a tax, for example GST on rates, the system we have is easy to administer and should not be tinkered with. Thank you for your time. David Maling

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. April 30, 2018 Dear Tax Working Group. Below is a submission regarding the invitaton here: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.n//oour-ssubmissions 1. Housing prices are a problem. While there are mano factors, certainlo an inflatonaro monetaro sostem and high GST rates contribute to this. 2. Recommend reducing GST to 7.5%. This benefts low income people and also reduces the cost of homes. 3. Phase out of the Reserve Bank sostem and being fullo supportve of private based monetaro exchange sostems based on precious metals. This will bring pricing stabilito. 4. Residents with incomes under the $14,000 level should be exempt from income tax. 5. GST raises house prices, deters uptake of electric cars, and taxes lower income people more. These are reasons the GST rate needs to be reduced. In other countries like the UK and the United States, there are sales tax rebates for purchase of electric cars. Electric cars are vero important for clean air and water and reducing the dependenco on oil imports and therefore drastcallo lowering the flow of moneo out of the countro for oil. GST needs to be completelo exempt on electric cars. Longer-sterm there is the potental that greatlo reduced purchases of foreign oil will reduce house prices because this will mean that there is less selling of the New Zealand dollar versus the currencies used to purchase the oil causing the New Zealand dollar to be stronger. With a stronger New Zealand dollar this then makes house prices less afordable to foreigners therebo reducing the efect of higher prices due to foreign purchases of homes. 6. New Zealand should have a compettve compano tax. It should be reduced signifcantlo. The desire should be to cause companies that have no environmental or other detrimental impact to relocate to New Zealand and immigraton polico needs to accommodate this to be fullo supportve of allowing easo migraton of these businesses. 7. Immigraton polico goes hand-sin-shand with tax polico because the more productve immigrants that are in this countro, the more economic actvito, and therefore more revenue not onlo for government, but for the public in general. Productve immigrants, especiallo in the IT sector, should have vero easo means of entro into this countro without restrictons. 8. One proposal would be a new categoro of compano that would be enttled to a 12% rate. oor example, if a compano has 80% of its income from foreign sources (in other words, it is primarilo exportng its goods or services) and emploos New Zealanders whether existng residents or new immigrants, and has no environmental impact, then it should be enttled to this low rate. This will bring a great influx of non-simpactng business actvito into this countro which is onlo going to be a positve. It is not going to take awao from other businesses in this countro, and it is not going to have ano detrimental impact. It is onlo going to be a positve. oor example, informaton technologo companies can relocate to New Zealand even if their primaro customer base is elsewhere. This can make New Zealand a major informaton technologo hub for the world. Think of all of the opportunito there is to bring new IT businesses into this countro from elsewhere. Think of all the highlo qualifed people that will come. You need to consider what a compano would be getng relocatng to New Zealand if it is facing a 28% rate. Does it reallo makes sense that the NZ government is a one third shareholder in evero NZ compano especiallo when the compano mao be primarilo doing foreign business. You should have the mindset of what New Zealand can do for the world and how New Zealand can be a hub of /ero impact (meaning not competng with existng NZ companies and having no environmental impact ) world beneftng businesses, not troing to fgure out how to raise more revenue. The more economic actvito in the countro, then naturallo the additonal income will come into this countro and ano essental services that have to be paid for, can be funded through this increased economic actvito. 9. There needs to be more reliance on user fees (like vehicle registraton fees) targetng the use of infrastructure rather than general tax. oor example, the cost of roads and other infrastructure needs to be paid for through user fees to the extent this is not alreado the case. With technologo, there is the means to track infrastructure use more easilo. 10. While it is not the tax working groups role to be setng government spending polico, it needs to be pointed out to the government that spending is a vero important consideraton. It is the spending which is creatng the need for tax. The government should not underestmate the abilito of people in the free market to innovate and provide for themselves and greatlo reduce the need on government. Communicatons technologo and the goodwill of people can help with this. With modern communicatons and concepts like crowdfunding, an increasing populaton, and the rato of the resident populaton to elected representatves at at an increasing rato, it is important, that the concept of decentrali/aton be followed. 11. Opposed introducing a capital gains tax. 12. The world is changing and there is globali/aton and this is reallo an opportunito for letng the free market and private sector grow and be more self-ssufcient, and allow the people to create healthier, happier and more helpful relatons between each other. We see peace between North and South Korea now. This is a path that needs to be followed bo all peoples and this lessens the need for tax revenue because there will be less need for defense. 13. It should not be the role of government to decide what categories of food items are taxable or not. This is going to be administratvelo a burden for all involved. Simplo reduce the GST. And exempt lower income people altogether from income tax. 14. oinallo, while most people mao not recogni/e this, tax is compulsoro. Therefore, oou have to think carefullo before changing tax polico, or increasing taxes. Ano changes should ultmatelo should result in neutralito or lower taxes overall, and more freedom for the people to innovate. With modern advanced communicatons, freedom of travel, lower taxes, the people themselves can innovate more and create solutons for themselves to be more self-ssufcient and reduce the need raise to revenue through tax since there will be less need for government services and greater efciencies. I would be happo to be contacted to discuss these ideas. Respectullo submitted, Anthono Sarafa

Submission to the Tax Working Group Introduction In their ground-breaking book. The Spirit Level, Richard Wilkinson & Kate Pickett, provide hard evidence to show how almost everything from life expectancy to mental illness, violence and illiteracy, is affected not by how wealthy a society is, but by how equal it is. It shows societies, with a bigger gap between the rich and poor, are bad for everyone in them - including the well-off. The Spirit Level: Richard G. Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, published in 2009 by Allen Lane – also in the US (Bloomsbury Press) and later in the UK (Penguin Books) What does the Future of Tax Look Like? Tax needs to be fair and sufficient and comprehensive. For tax to be fair and credible and thus merit compliance tax must be progressively applied to all income. As income rises, so does tax. The system tax wealth created in NZ, products brought to NZ, leaving NZ and those who reside or work here no matter the source of the income local or global. Tax-on income should be free or very low (say 3.5%) up to the level for instance of the current single National Super (e.g. $0 to $16,000) then progressive much as the current bands to $150,00 at 39%, but the next band should cut in sooner and we should be prepared to tax up to 95% of really high incomes(Top Tax rates Denmark 55.8%, Aust. 49%,USA 46.3%,Fr. 54%,UK 45%), but when I was growing up higher rates were not uncommon for the very wealthy. This system should apply to all who choose to reside, or own property or enterprises in NZ. Where individuals or entities claim to be paying tax in another jurisdiction, an assessment should be made based on explicit criteria, such as the income necessary for that lifestyle or ownership in NZ. Transnationals should pay a tax based on the NZ element of their activities. The tax system needs to be sufficient to fund the activities required to maintain and develop our infrastructure, people and environment with a view to transitioning to a carbon neutral economy and eliminating wastes such as plastic that are seriously polluting our ecosystems A Flat Tax of say 0.01% on all financial transactions, including cryptocurrency transactions, exempting transactions less than $1000 needs to be introduced, and an annually assessed wealth tax – starting at say $2million of assets, including family trusts, but this should be examined to avoid it being regressive. An Empty Homes Tax on residential properties in NZ cities unoccupied longer than 4 months annually, taxed at 1% of the property’s assessed taxable value. What is the Purpose of Tax? To fully fund the government, protect the natural and social environments upon which people and the economy are reliant, insure that wealth is fairly allocated and to shape behaviour. While pollution and, resource degradation or depletion has harmed the natural environment, the extreme inequality that is developing in recent decades is degrading the social environment. The existing taxation system has facilitated this environmental and social decline through exploitation of many commons. Tax can and should play an explicit role in encouraging preservation by taxing that which harms and encouraging that which helps. This is particularly relevant to our green-house gas emissions. Taxing rather than subsidizing the activities which emit carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide and fluorinated gases and the like and providing tax relief for changing land use and transport modes away from fossil fuels. Are We Taxing the Right Things? Along with a financial transactions tax, a capital gains tax is required. While I consider charities should retain their tax-free status, entities trading for profit it should not be considered to be a charity. Sanitarium, is a huge corporate, that I feel is routing the system GST could be removed from essentials such as food, medicine and sanitary products. And morph into a luxury tax to discourage unproductive consumption. GST could be extended to include items NZ consumers buy from overseas international websites. Frequent speculative financial trading needs a ‘Robin Hood’ tax small enough to not burden legitimate activity, large enough to discourage if not stop it. A carbon tax priced to account for the full impacts and a premium is required. Returning the premium portion of the tax collected evenly to all consumers will help to offset the impacts. This might include raising the lower threshold even higher than I’ve suggested above. Estate and Gift tax to encourage meritocracy, not dynasties. A Revenue Tax on Foreign Multi Nationals diverting profits to avoid tax, say a NZ company tax on portion of total revenue earned in New Zealand (e.g. 10%) times their total international company profit This would include companies whose businesses depend on digital advertising, online marketplaces, including google, facebook, amazon, twitter, uber & airbnb, Departure Tax on non-value-added goods. Too many of NZ’s resources, logs, water are sent overseas. A departure tax could increase employment and income to NZ. The government should not fund losses from investing or asset sales. The current tax system is highly regressive with the poor paying tax on nearly all of their income twice due to GST and tax rates which tax even the minimal income required to sustain life. Can Tax Make Housing More Affordable? The lack of a capital gains tax unfairly subsidises unearned income. This has resulted in a speculative unaffordable housing market. Capital is poorly allocated to non-productive investing in housing. Capital demand and costs are increased as the housing bubble builds creating the need for more capital from overseas lenders and cash outflow from the country. What Tax Issues Matter Most to You? Fairness both in contribution and in sharing the gains from the tax system through infrastructure and a safe sustainable community and environment. Tax loopholes which primarily benefit business, corporations, investors and high net worth individuals should be closed and emphasis given to our common heritage and wellbeing. A progressive tax structure where tax rates increase with the ability to pay should be seen as the quid pro quo of the private advantage of the better off. Evading and minimizing tax, especially by those with high tax liability should be recognized for the antisocial behaviour that it is and subject to serious loss of privileges. Instruments such as asset protection trusts set up basically to avoid tax should be voidable for the collection of legitimate debts including assessment of an appropriate tax. Parliament should be able to work in conjunction with the IRD to speedily close loopholes and adjust laws and regulations to thwart evasion and avoidance.

Edward Challies 30 April 2018 To Whom It May Concern, RE: Tax Working Group: Future of Tax Consultation Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. To me, a future tax system must do more to mitigate environmental degradation caused by our key productive sectors. Taxation should be designed to reflect and mitigate environmental and social costs of private economic activity, and to incentivise environmentally and socially responsible behaviour. A water tax may be one example, but there is a need to think more broadly about the appropriation and use (an in many cases misuse) of our collective natural capital by private businesses – I am referring to commons such as water, soil, air, landscapes and other natural resources. In particular I am concerned at the ability of individual and collective private enterprises to appropriate natural capital, and secure this for an apparently indefinite time, with no tax on the proceeds. What is more, this appropriation is often subsidised by taxpayers and ratepayers on the (invariably unproven) argument that it will drive regional economic growth that will spill over to benefit everyone. This is usually based on privately commissioned (e.g. NZIER) economic modelling, but rarely substantiated empirically after the fact – and such cases would benefit from a requirement for formal evaluation and per review (by e.g. Treasury, the Productivity Commission, or the Office of the Auditor General). For example: A group of private businesses (mostly irrigators) want to see a large irrigation dam and augmentation scheme built in their District. The scheme is prohibitively expensive for many land owners on a per hectare basis, but some of the largest and most intensive businesses can easily afford to buy shares in the scheme. The District Council announces that ratepayers will contribute a large share due to the supposed common-good benefits that they will all enjoy as a result of improved flows in the river. Furthermore, taxpayers nationwide will pay, as the scheme is allocated funds from the Freshwater Improvement Fund (on the basis that it will address the environmental problem of low flows arising from over-allocation). The Council will use the Public Works Act to help the irrigators acquire the necessary land for the dam. We end up with a situation where a relatively small group of business owners, who happen to be able to afford it, are allowed to dam a public river, tap into public money (in the form of rates and tax dollars), and appropriate natural capital (in this case water) and perhaps secure quasi-private property rights over water, and benefit from future appreciation in the value of that resource. In many parts of the world this has been referred to as ‘water grabbing’ . All is premised on the dubious assertion that these benefits will trickle down to benefit everyone. \[1\] I suggest there is a need to look at the feasibility of a tax on the speculative appropriation of natural resources, and limitations on ‘natural capital grabbing’ in order to ensure a socially just and environmentally sustainable use of our common pool natural resources such as, but not limited to water, air, soil, minerals, biodiversity etc. There must be a way to achieve this while not unduly stifling entrepreneurialism, innovation and development. Ultimately, though, the equity and sustainability outcomes should be prioritised through the tax system, and our productive sectors must be profitable without massive social and environmental externalities going unaddressed. Thank you, Ed Challies

Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand To whom it may concern, I am a Public Health Doctor and would like to see taxation used to optimally improve public health, as a method to raise revenue to fund government programmes and infrastructure improving social determinants of health; to address negative externalities of products that cause harm; and also as a tool to achieve societal (such as phasing out smoking). I agree with Nick Wilson’s recent blog, which contains references for the following points- A public health perspective on taxing harmful products (https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/pubhealthexpert/2018/04/16/a-public-health-perspective-on-taxing- harmful-products/) Many products and activities warrant consideration for tax over and above any blanket GST type tax, including those already with special excise taxes in NZ (alcohol, tobacco) and those not yet taxed (eg, sugary drinks that harm health). A health impact evaluation needs to be included on all aspects of tax reform (including equity impact evaluation). Carbon tax to protect planetary health-Climate change is a major threat to the planet and to health in NZ and the Pacific. Major reform is needed to the Emissions Trading Scheme and the consideration of a Carbon Tax, without loopholes. Tobacco Tax-Tobacco tax increases are the most effective and inexpensive way of reducing tobacco smoking prevalence, consumption, initiation and inequalities in smoking. Taxation can be used to address smoking in terms of negative externalities from smoking and for the “tax as tool” principle to achieve a smokefree 2025. Recent regular tax increases on tobacco have resulted in decreased sales and prevalence of smoking. Further increases in tobacco tax are also very likely to produce further health gain, reduce health inequalities and generate cost-savings for the NZ health system by encouraging people to use alternatives that are less hazardous to health than tobacco smoking. Alcohol and Taxation- hazardous patterns of drinking are having a major impact on the health of the drinker but also on others-injury, crime, child and family violence/neglect, accidents, chronic diseases (especially cancer) and mental health and addiction issues. Alcohol use is a major contributor to health costs and lost productivity. Increasing alcohol taxation will provide a price incentive to reduce consumption reducing harm and associated health and societal costs and can be done in a way to reduce hazardous drinking for those most deprived resulting in more equitable health outcomes. There needs to be an increase in tax revenue earmarked to address substantive knowledge deficits among NZ citizens around the harms associated with alcohol. Taxation on other unhealthy products- the evidence around taxation of high calorie products such as sugary drink and high calorie foods (junk foods) is mounting, and taxes that encourage reformulation (such as the UK’s soft drink industry levy) need to be encouraged. Taxation on advertising harmful products should also be considered. Thank you for considering some of these key issues that are extremely important to public health and I’m happy to speak to this submission. \[1\] Dr Felicity Williamson \[1\]

It should not be used for social engineering purposes, since any attempts to do so inevitably have unintended adverse consequences on efficiency and equity. With these core principles in mind, I have some brief comments on a few worrying ideas that have been floated. My comments can be summarised as follows: I. A capital gains tax would increase compliance costs, tax evasion and bureaucracy, and would fail to pass any conceivable cost-benefit test. II. A broad-based land tax could well be a good idea, but exempting the family home makes it, at best, pointless. III. Allowing for varying rates of GST would be the economic equivalent of an own goal. IV. “Public health” taxes (e.g., sugar tax) typically do not work, have unintended consequences, and open up ethical cans of worms. I am happy to discuss these points further should the TWG consider it necessary to do so. 1. Capital Gains Tax Proponents of a capital gains tax (in addition to the one that already exists) frequently justify their position on the basis that many other countries already have such a tax. Yet, as the socialist economist Joan Robinson famously remarked in another context: “Just because other countries are stupid enough to put rocks in their harbours doesn’t mean we should put rocks in ours.” The three certain consequences of a capital gains tax are: • a massive increase in compliance costs for honest taxpayers; • a significant increase in tax evasion activity by dishonest taxpayers; • the creation of a major new bureaucracy for helping honest taxpayers and fighting dishonest taxpayers. In return, the government will receive a relatively small, pro-cyclical, amount of additional revenue, while any possible (but doubtful) impact on the tangential goal of improved housing affordability will be eliminated by the requirement that the family home is exempt. In short, a capital gains tax could not pass any conceivable cost-benefit test. 2. Land Tax A broad-based land tax would not suffer from the disadvantages of a capital gains tax noted above: additional compliance costs would be low and evasion would be difficult. So, if introduced in conjunction with a reduction in income tax rates, a land tax could well be a sensible initiative. However, the benefits of doing so are completely eliminated by the requirement that the family home be exempt. With such an exemption in place, all that will happen is a large increase in the number of “families” and, consequently, “family homes”. Worse still, exempting the family home beds in a system that taxes land used for relatively high- productivity purposes (business and enterprise) while not taxing land used for lower- productivity activities (owner-occupied housing). This makes no sense at all. 2 In short, a land tax could be a good idea, but exempting the family home makes it a pointless exercise. 3. Variable GST rates There are two certain consequences of offering lower GST rates on so-called “merit” goods: • endless arguments about what should be on the list of merit goods; • endless disputes about whether a particular good meets the definition of an already-agreed merit good. Messing around with NZ’s beautifully simple GST system would be the economic equivalent of an own goal. 4. “Public Health” taxes A prominent example of this sort of thing is a sugar tax. Yes, too much sugar is bad for us, and undoubtedly contributes to the so-called obesity crisis. But economics and tax experts have repeatedly concluded that sugar taxes do not result in lower incidences of obesity (that would require a tax on obesity). So introducing a sugar tax would penalise responsible sugar users while having no effect on public health outcomes (it would also, incidentally, almost certainly be regressive). Taxes of this kind are also a slippery slope. If sugar, then why not, say, meat? Excessive consumption of the latter is just as bad as sugar for public health, and it has significantly more adverse environmental consequences (not to mention its animal welfare implications). So the case for a meat tax would seem to be considerably stronger than for a sugar tax. But the political fallout would be such that it would be an extraordinarily brave TWG that recommended a meat tax. At the same time, it would be an extraordinarily hypocritical TWG that recommended a sugar tax and not a meat tax. To avoid getting bogged down in such moral quagmires, I suggest the TWG avoid these kinds of taxes altogether. Conclusion No tax system is perfect, but the current NZ system is simple, easy to navigate, and relatively efficient. As they say in Texas, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. While there may be improvements that could be made at the margin, major reform is simply unnecessary. Glenn Boyle \[1\]

SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP Background I am a retired District Court Judge who held a Family Court warrant and heard many care and protection cases under The Children Young Persons and their Families Act and applications for protection orders under The Domestic Violence Act. Since retirement I have done my best to advocate, as a national goal, a positive start for every child. Although there will be short term costs in achieving this, I consider it will have significant financial and other societal benefits in the longer term. I have addressed these issues in a number of presentations I have given. Excerpts follow: On position of children Let me give you one example of how our present system disadvantages one particular minority - the children of the poor. The least we can give them should be a positive start in life. Not necessarily an equal start. That is impossible; but a positive start. They do not choose to whom they are born or the circumstances of their birth family. But they are our future adults: children of the community, as well as of their birth parents. Way too many are starting life in deprived circumstances, to the ultimate financial and societal cost of us all. According to the annual New Zealand Child Poverty Monitor report in 2016 (a partnership project between the Office of the Children's Commissioner, the J. R. McKenzie Trust and Otago University) 295,000 New Zealand children were living in income poverty, using the latest statistics then available. That is 28% of our children. This particular measure has regard to the overall wealth of our society as a whole. In other words, our wealth gap. 295,000 is six full stadiums at Eden Park - full just of children. 85,000 children were living in seriously deprived circumstances. That is still nearly two full stadiums. One of the reasons of course is that these children have no vote. The haves are mostly concerned about the effect of policy on their own immediate financial position, so we just forget these children and their struggling parents and cast them aside on a trash heap. In the parents' case it is generally perceived as their own fault, regardless of their own upbringing or other circumstances; and regardless of any wish they may have to provide for their children as well as they possibly can. This continuing disregard for the welfare of the poor, and in particular that of disadvantaged children, already underlies a whole range of immensely costly outcomes, reflected in a series of adverse comparative statistics, internationally. And the actual cost takes no account of wasted potential and lost productivity. All this neglect in an economy that is supposedly doing well. This is not only short-sighted. It is just plain crazy. On financial aspects The costs of a poor start in life include poor health outcomes, learning difficulties at school requiring extra resources and assistance, disruption in class, ultimately the development of poor peer relationships, early use of alcohol and other drugs, prostitution, minor offending, then serious criminal offending. Some of our worst criminals had appallingly abused and neglected childhoods which we simply didn't know or care about. They still had choices but their respective childhoods never equipped them with anything in the nature of empathy or any other facility to make good considered choices. The health, educational and justice cost outcomes of a poor start in life are all individually huge. This is without the social and emotional costs to others and without bringing into account lost and wasted potential. There have been several attempts to estimate the overall cost of allowing a large number of children to have a poor start in life. The problem is that such costs are difficult to compute with precision, depending on how much you attribute to lost and wasted potential and lower productivity - in addition to the more obvious health, educational and criminal justice costs. One study, prepared by Infometrics in 2011, "1,000 days to Get it Right for Every Child" endeavoured to do so. It put the annual cost to the New Zealand economy of poor child outcomes at 3% of GDP annually (approximately $6 billion). Another study bringing into account wages, crime, health and welfare costs put the total at 4.5% of GDP (John Pearce, "Estimate of the Costs of Child Poverty in New Zealand", paper prepared for Analytica, 10 August 2011). As business journalist Rod Oram has noted this negates the economic gains from 6 million cows in the dairy industry! So it is a huge negative cost factor. And however dismissive one might be about such assessments I don't believe anyone can rightly deny that both these studies constituted sincere and genuine attempts to assess the overall costs to our economy of a poor start in life for way too many of our children. To my knowledge Treasury itself has not made any attempt to make its own assessment of these negative cost factors. Halve or even quarter the above cost estimates and the figures are still such that we simply cannot allow the situation to continue substantially unaddressed. In November 2011 the Analytica group advised: "The economic cost of child poverty is large. When considered in relation to its social consequences, it may be more important to New Zealand's future than global warming". In December 2012 the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on Solutions to Child Poverty, convened by the Children's Commissioner, simply observed, in its conclusion: "Unless a concerted effort is made now to reduce child poverty, the costs that it imposes today, both social and economic, are likely to be magnified in generations to come". That warning is now more than two years old. In the meantime the increasing wealth gap, even more than any income gap, is leading to a distinctly unhealthy sense of divisiveness. With hindsight one has to query how prudent it was to cut most child-related benefits by about 21% in the 1991 budget, resulting in a doubling of childhood poverty. The comparative worth of child benefits, particularly for those not qualifying for Family Support has since continued to decline in relative terms. Child-related benefits have also become totally inequitable as between children. The original child safety net has gone. It is now extremely difficult to provide for, let alone give children any extra developmental opportunities they may need, on either the current minimum wage or a domestic purposes benefit. While the 2015 budget acknowledged childhood poverty issues and adjusted some benefits, albeit without effect until 1 April 2016, these long overdue adjustments are not the total answer. We cannot say: "Problem solved and fixed". A total review of all child related benefits is required to achieve both an overall simplification and equity between children - for the ultimate benefit of us all. Such review needs to have as its starting point the basic costs of housing, feeding, providing health and dental care, access to pre-school education and support services for a child, with an allowance for the transport costs of doing so. Any resultant increases in the level of child support will have the supplementary effect of stimulating local businesses. I should add that from a purely economic perspective - and most things these days seem to be viewed from this perspective - we spend much more on the last three years of life, for little if any productive gain, and comparatively little on the first three years, from which there can be a hugely productive outcome. I am not, however, suggesting we spend less on needed care of the elderly; rather that there is much to be gained from investing more in our children, particularly - but far from exclusively - in their early most formative years. On the wealth gap Jesus has been described in many ways to reflect his life and teaching - prophet, priest, king, shepherd, Son of Man, Son of God. I recently heard him described anew as a 'peaceful anarchist'; and it is this description of his life and work that I would like to leave with you this morning. He challenged the authorities, condemned the injustices of his day, denounced hypocrisy wherever he perceived it, together with the hidebound rules that stood in the way of a compassionate response. His life and teaching were infused with a deep caring concern for all, but particularly for the poor, the outcast and the marginalised. The poor and the marginalised are still very much with us. We still have a huge and increasingly divisive gap, in my view an obscene gap, between the excessively rich and powerful and the impoverished and powerless, world-wide. On a capital tax For those aghast at any suggestion of either a capital tax or a capital gains tax, spare a thought for future generations, including your own children and grandchildren, if blessed with those. "The Spirit Level" (Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, Allen Lane, Penguin Group, 2009) clearly indicates that more equal societies almost always do better in most respects and Colin James in "Unquiet Times" (Fraser Books, 2017) refers at p. 89 to an OECD finding that too great income inequality has a negative and statistically significant impact on subsequent growth. He also observes that on a single day in September 2016 the president of the European Central Bank, the president of the European Council and the head of the International Monetary Fund all warned of a back-lash that could undermine market- capitalism. Additionally he notes that an International Monetary Fund report in 2014 found that "the combined direct and indirect effects of redistribution \[of wealth\] are on average pro- growth". James wryly observes: "Neither the OECD nor the IMF are wistful socialists of a bygone age. They have been one of the strongest advocates for a market economy." But how do you get findings such as these accepted by a sufficient number of the voting public? I frankly don't know; but when recent data released by Oxfam NZ, in association with its 2018 report "Reward Work, Not Wealth" reports that 1 per cent of the population has received 28 per cent of the country's wealth in a single year while 1.4 million people (30 percent of the population) got barely 1 per cent of all the wealth created in 2017, then it is surely more than time for something to be done. As reported by The New Zealand Herald, 22 January 2018, "The research also showed a mere 10 per cent of New Zealanders own more than half the nation's wealth and the inequality gap has widened significantly in the past year." Wealth is linked to power; and power preserves and multiplies wealth. The balance needs to be redressed. Overall considerations I appreciate that there are many other areas than childhood poverty (not only income poverty, but poverty of opportunity and poverty of spirit) for which funding is required: health, education, infrastructure, justice issues and climate change issues to name a few. Quite simply we need more tax revenue to accomplish these things; and we need to reduce the wealth gap for a fairer and better future for all our tamariki and mokopuna, our children and grandchildren. I consider this can be best achieved by a relatively low level capital tax of 1 or 2%. If somebody with significant assets cannot cover a return on their capital of at least 1or 2% then they are probably not using their assets well: yet maybe land-banking for future capital gain. A capital tax could encourage better use of assets. Depending on calculations of likely yield it might possibly also enable some reduction in GST. Concluding Submissions For all the reasons traversed above, more particularly in the excerpts, I consider the Working Group should give consideration to a low level capital tax on net assets. While it is probably not within the Group's purview I consider the family home exemption for each taxpayer should be the average value of a home in that region for the previous year. Simple. No valuation of house needed. We should not encourage the building of mansions. Alternatively there could be an exemption for net assets of less than say one or two million dollars to obviate the need for returns below a specified net asset worth. I do not consider any exemption should apply to trusts. They usually represent surplus assets, or assets people wish to protect from creditors. Companies would not be liable for the tax but the value of each taxpayer's shareholdings in companies would need to be included. For those with net assets falling into the taxable category the value of their shareholdings would need to be certified as a correct valuation estimate by either a chartered accountant or registered sharebroker. This would be the only onerous requirement, less in subsequent years than the first. There is not much else onerous in the proposal. There can be little harm in everybody calculating and knowing their net asset worth. Simple, compared with a capital gains tax. Another advantage of a capital tax is a relatively quick revenue return. It will produce additional revenue, for the perceived needs outlined above, within a year or so of its introduction. Issues that would need to be considered by the working group are whether or not net assets are net New Zealand assets or, for New Zealand citizens, net total assets. Ramifications of people possibly removing assets overseas or renouncing New Zealand citizenship are well beyond my competency to address.

Changing Demographics We can redefine "working age". Older people can and want to, continue to be active in the community. On the other hand there are probably many younger people who could use their time better spending more of it with their families. Age should not be the criterion but rather health and choice. Taxing wages and salaries distorts peoples choices. I see a future where wage and salary levels are much more varied reflecting the different value of the work to the community and encouraging people to work in high value areas. A universal income would make this possible without throwing low value workers into poverty. On the other hand it would also affect the distribution of money and thus affect relative prices. Work that is currently low paid might be revealed as the truly high value work. I have reservations about taxing "investment" income. We do not want to discourage genuine investment any more than we want to discourage valuable work. We should tax those things that exist in nature before anyone makes choices and which will be neither increased no decreased by the taxation disincentive. We should tax natural resources such as land, minerals, the carbon sink etc. We should tax those who own or have exclusive licences to use such things whether they make an income from them or not. This will discourage "land-banking' and similar attempts to profit by withholding from use. We should all equally be considered the owners of all natural resources and as such can collectively set restrictions on in what way and in what quantity natural resources can be used. Te Ao Maori A universal income paid to all maori equally with non-maori will give the people the power to encourage businesses that act in accordance with their values through their purchasing decisions. The natural owners of natural resources (everyone equally) can regulate to protect natural resources. The changing nature of work. The automation of work is part of the changing nature of work. If the changing nature of work encourages a change from taxation of wages and salaries to taxation of natural resources this is a good thing. We need to move away from a work based community and economy to a resource based community and economy. The living of the people should be defined by the natural resources available per capita not by the availabilty of employment. Government income should be determined by the services the people have indicated that they are willing to pay for not by the number of people employed and the amount they are paid or by the amount of stuff that people can make and sell to people who have money to buy. Environmental Challenges Those emitting pollutants should be paying tax now. As far as it is possible to determine this should include insurance against future clean- up costs. They will, of course, pass this cost on to the consumers of their products thus raising awareness of the true cost of those products. In many cases this may mean a large reduction in the amount that can be produced. We are collectively responsible. We must inform ourselves well, vote well, regulate well and tax well. Only polluters who break regulations or fail to pay taxes or bonds should be held acccountable for future losses unless it can be shown that, like the tobacco industry, they knew very well the damage they were doing and deliberately encouraged misinformation. Technology Yes, we need to move away from a work based tax system. We can continue to tax natural resources to pay for the universal income but if we allow global population to continue to grow we cannot expect this to be enough to support continued growth in our "standard of living". Technology may help to make scarce resources go further but we are reaching limits. Improving Productivity Are the current settings working for New Zealand? NO. We need to consider what we are producing not consider that any production is good. We need to consider who we are producing for - those with money. So we need to consider ways to distribute money to the people we want the economy to work for - everyone equally? Inequality Inequality stems from property rights that were set in place before we had democratic states. The market delivers in proportion to ones initial endowment. This includes property rights. I work for the people with property. I happen to have a talent or skill valued by the people who have property. They pay me well. I have more than I need to exist so I can save. In the next round the market delivers more to me. Eventually I can buy some "property" myself. I think I invested the fruits of my labour to buy this property. No amount of labour can be equally to perpetual property rights in any natural resource. I bought stolen property from some one who grossly undervalued it because they had plenty through no virtue of their own. Most of these property rights that have been carelessly sold off originally came from the might is right era before the state. Either directly taken by force or gifted by a grateful monarch for using force to protect his property. Tax property, tax the whole asset value of the property. Pay the revenue out to everyone equally. watch relative prices change. Globalisation Sure it is unfair if we have GST that local producers and retailers have to pay but it is very hard to ensure that importers do. GST falls more heavily on the poor as they spend a higher percentage of their income. It is a regressive tax. Abolish it. Do not tax voluntary exchanges of goods. Should New Zealand use the tax system to encourage better choices and discourage harmful ones? Generally only if their is a measurable social cost. Yes tax polluters they are using a scarce collective resource. Such taxes should not be seen as incentivising good behaviour but as paying for something you have chosen to use. Tobacco and sugar taxes can be seen as paying for the extra health care services that such consuming behaviours make necessary. They should be related to accepted actual related costs. Perhaps we should tax rugby playing? Do rugby clubs pay ACC levies? Are we taxing the right things Absolutely not. We should move away from taxing wages and salaries and business incomes as soon as possible. We do not want to disincentivise productivity. We should abolish GST: it is regressive. We should not tax capital gains we should tax the unearned income value of all natural resources. The location value should go to the local authority whose ratepayers have contributed to the surrounding infrastructure. The natural resource value should go to pay for the universal income. Can tax make housing more affordable?

Page 1 of 3 Submission to the Tax Working Group James Adams, student of Law & Politics at the University of Auckland Former intern at The Treasury, summer 2017-2018 General Remarks New Zealand’s tax system exists to raise revenue, which is used to fund the government’s activities. We all rely on the state to legislate in the public interest, to support those who are unable to support themselves, and to provide a variety of goods and services. In this way, tax is the price we pay for a civilised society, as Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr famously said. The tax system also exists to promote desirable outcomes directly. For instance, the excise tax on alcohol reflects the fact that the price that consumers pay for liquor does not reflect the cost that society bears as a result of its consumption. Taxes of this sort can discourage harmful behaviour and raise revenue, which can be used to mitigate the worst effects of the activity. Desirable outcomes can also be promoted through the design of the tax system: the progressivity of the income tax rates ensures that those who have higher incomes pay more in tax. In this way, the two objectives of a good tax system can be complementary. In my view, politicians and tax officials in the last thirty years have predominantly focused on raising revenue in such a way that minimises distortions and promotes coherence. These were appropriate priorities at a time when New Zealand was rapidly liberalising its economy, but today, the context is different. While we know that the level of taxation and government intervention under Muldoon was costly and ineffective, we also know that successive governments have failed to remedy the negative social effects of the subsequent economic transition. Further, New Zealand faces a number of challenges in the years ahead, including water management, climate change, an aging population and the changing nature of work. Tax can and should be part of our response to these challenges. I do not call for the Tax Working Group to abandon the principles that have guided tax policy developments in the past: efficiency, revenue integrity and practical concerns are just as important today as they were in the 1980s. I merely call for a richer understanding of two principles that are sometimes sidelined in tax policy thinking: fairness and responsiveness. Fairness I have heard it said that when the ‘established criteria’ for assessing tax policy proposals are applied, fairness tends not to get the same attention as the other principles. I do not necessarily agree, because the emphasis on minimising distortions is simply one way of speaking about a particular type of fairness. This is frequently captured by the idea that ‘taxation should not affect people’s investment choices; different investments should be taxed as similarly as possible.’ However, this conception of fairness is deficient in a number of respects. For a start, its very language obscures that fact that there are a large number of New Zealanders who simply do not have the means to ‘make investment choices.’ In his 2017 paper for the Ministry of Social Development, Brian Perry found that –after housing costs and inflation had been taken into account– the poorest 10% of New Zealanders have seen no improvement in their incomes since 1982, while the incomes of the wealthiest 10% of New Zealanders have doubled in that \[ Page 2 of 3 period. A growing body of scholarship clearly shows the harm caused, to economies and societies, by such wide differences between rich and poor. Taxation is not divorced from politics; it was a substantial contributor to the disparities we see today, and I believe that that tax could be used more effectively to promote equality of opportunity. Secondly, for all the talk about BBLR, successive governments have failed to eliminate the largest distortion in our tax system: our lack of a comprehensive capital gains tax (CGT). Multiple tax reviews have considered CGT and none have come out in favour, which suggests the evidence for such a tax might not be as strong as its proponents claim. However, I urge this Tax Working Group to seriously consider the idea once again; not from the perspective of whether it will take the heat out of the housing market, but simply as a base- broadening measure that is desirable in the interests of fairness. It is important to get the details right, but I urge the Group not to lose sight of the bigger picture. New Zealand’s income tax, in particular, has developed over the course of many years. It was not perfect when it was introduced, and neither should we expect a CGT to perform to an unrealistically high standard. On the subject of details, it seems to me that: • Taxing capital gains on realisation, rather than accrual, is more practical. • There should be as few exceptions to the tax as possible, in keeping with the BBLR philosophy; it is for this reason that I prefer a CGT to a land tax. • There should be no exceptions for ‘like kind’ transfers, such as where a cryptocurrency trader sells one digital currency and invests in another. • The tax rates should be the same as those on personal income. Of course, if you find that a CGT is not worth pursuing, then I encourage the Group to recommend other options for taxing wealth, although I acknowledge that the Group is unable to recommend any form of inheritance tax. Responsiveness I also urge the Tax Working Group not to be unnecessarily constrained by the BBLR principle. Having a large, stable tax base is a wonderful thing for revenue integrity, but restricting ourselves to taxing broad bases can result in missed opportunities. For example, there is significant public concern about water bottling plants, and there have been calls to impose a specific tax on businesses that engage in this activity. Tax purists would be aghast at the idea of singling out a particular industry, and would argue that the coherence of the tax system would be undermined if such a tax were to be pursued. Respectfully, I disagree: the tax system should be responsive to communities and their concerns. There is a value in demonstrating that people’s opinions matter, and in more cases than at present, this should outweigh the loss of coherence, equality or certainty. Similarly, the BBLR principle should not prevent us from using tax as a policy lever where there is strong evidence suggesting that quantifiable negative outcomes could be avoided by imposing a tax. Other submitters will speak to the effectiveness (or otherwise) of increasing the tax on alcohol, taxing sugar-sweetened beverages, or using tax to promote environmental sustainability. If some of these proposals stack up and are implemented (as I hope they will), the rest of the tax system will not be substantially affected. Page 3 of 3 Conclusion New Zealand has one of the better tax systems in the world, and I do not see any need to make radical changes to it. However, I urge the Tax Working Group to investigate proposals that could promote fairness, understood in a richer and more consistent sense than at present. I ask the Group to be responsive to public concerns, even if this means that the overall coherence of the tax system is undermined to some extent. In this way, I believe that tax can be more than simply plucking the goose for its feathers, but can be a force for good in our nation.

Submission to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Future of Tax. I am submitting as a taxpayer with a comfortable income, and as someone with many years’ experience in public health and social research. 1. I want to see greater income and wealth equity in New Zealand. This is important for the wellbeing of our country as a whole (not just about ‘helping the poor’). I see this as the most important challenge for the tax system in coming years. The system is currently unfair: wealth generates more wealth while many people are on the breadline with little prospect of improving their circumstances since the minimum wage does not even cover basic costs of living, let alone allow savings. I would be happy to pay higher personal income tax, to allow redistribution to those with lower incomes. 2. I support the use of tikanga Māori to underpin the principles and practices of taxation in Aotearoa New Zealand. Tikanga Māori provides wisdom and principles that all New Zealanders can understand and live by. 3. Lack of affordable (dry, warm) housing in NZ is a major health and humanitarian problem. I support a capital gains tax, because it will reduce speculation, encourage people to invest in more productive areas of the economy, and make the family home more affordable. Long term, it will help to reduce wealth inequality by allowing a greater proportion of NZers to own their own home. 4. I support the use of taxes to modify behaviour, provided this is done in a ‘smart’ way (e.g. with accompanying mass media campaigns and other policy measures that also encourage behaviour change) and accompanied by tax-breaks or other measures to put more money in the pockets of low income households, and ensure the material needs of children are met. Done well, they can encourage all New Zealanders (including disadvantaged communities and individuals) to live healthier, happier lives, while still allowing freedom of choice. Done poorly, they further ‘punish’ the poor and exacerbate child poverty. They need to be framed as health policies (not revenue-generation policies) and implemented as such, using an evidence-based approach to maximise their effectiveness. 5. I support continued increases in tobacco tax, provided that the additional revenue generated is earmarked for a) community-based and workplace/industry-based initiatives to denormalise smoking in low-income, Māori and Pacific communities and certain industries where smoking is still the norm, b) mass media campaigns to prevent smoking uptake and support quitting. Quit rates could be much increased if mass media campaigns were tied in to price rises. There is also evidence that a big tax increase every two years could be more effective than smaller increases every year, because of the ‘shock’ value. Along with continued tax increases is also important to introduce minimum pricing, as the tobacco industry has, to date, managed to keep budget brands cheap by cross-subsidising, thereby reducing the effectiveness of tax increases. It is also important to ensure that children of smokers do not suffer as a result of tobacco tax increases, e.g. via the continuation and expansion of fruit in schools, milk in schools and other initiatives to ensure children’s material needs are met. 6. I support the introduction of a sugar tax because evidence from other countries suggests such taxes can a) lead to product re-formulation and lower sugar content, and b) reduce sugar consumption, resulting in lower obesity rates and a healthier population. Attention needs to be given to discouraging substitution with equally unhealthy products. I support using the revenue to remove GST from fresh fruit and vegetables. 7. I support the increase of tax on alcohol, and argue that the revenue gained should be used to greatly expand the provision of alcohol and drug services. 8. I support the use of tax to discourage private car use and protect the environment from pollution/degradation. 9. As noted above I would like to see GST excluded from fresh and frozen (i.e. unprocessed) fruit and vegetables. Sugar should be taxed to make up for lost revenue. Yours sincerely, Jude Ball Wellington \[ \[1\]

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax Professor Jennie Connor Chair in Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin Main points I support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively supports the well-being of all New Zealanders. Changes to the current alcohol excise tax regime in New Zealand has the potential to improve the health and welfare of New Zealanders, and reduce inequities in health and social outcomes between Māori and non-Māori. To not adopt a healthier approach to alcohol taxation is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. Alcohol is a substantial contributor to poor physical and mental health, difficult family environments, ethnic and social disparities, crime and punishment. It overloads our hospitals, the NZ Police, our courts, the penal system, and special education services. In many NZ families it is the source of grief and despair from violence, traffic deaths and suicides, and it contributes to our high incarceration rates which particularly affect Māori. Improvements can be made at little cost to the country through changes to taxation. Hazardous drinking prevalence has been going up every year since the brief dip that accompanied the economic downturn, and is now sitting at about 20% of all New Zealanders over 14 years of age. There is also irrefutable evidence that regular consumption of alcohol at levels that are generally considered harmless in New Zealand causes cancers, including two of the most common causes of cancer death here, bowel and breast cancer. About 30% of the 800 deaths a year attributable to alcohol are from cancer. Harm from alcohol is higher in Māori than non-Māori on all measures. There has been no effective policy adopted to curb harm from alcohol in decades apart from reducing the drink-driving limit, despite evidence-based interventions being available and an extensive review by the Law Commission recommending them. Reducing the affordability of alcohol will reduce consumption and harm across the population. Excise tax is the most tested, and most effective, single measure available to do this, and it is non-stigmatising. It will also achieve other objectives that will be good for the country: 1.Increasing tax will increase the proportion of alcohol externalities that are paid for by industries that produce, distribute and sell this product at a great profit. It will also reduce the costs to society as the level of drinking will go down. Together this will enable revenue from taxes currently levied in the general population to be used for the public good, rather than wasted on dealing with the damage. 2. Reducing the affordability of alcohol will have the biggest benefits for the heaviest drinking groups in society, particularly those on low incomes, thus reducing inequities. Alcohol deserves particular attention because of the magnitude and scope of the harm that it causes and because the intervention is simple to implement and proven effective. The benefits will affect all New Zealanders, even non-drinkers, as much of alcohol’s harm is to people other than the drinker. Recommendations • Excise tax on alcohol be increased by at least 50% to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%, as was recommended by the Law Commission in 2010. The expected drop in \[1\] consumption would be 5% across the whole population. The arguments for this are detailed in the Law Commission report “Alcohol in our Lives: Curbing the Harm” • Regular excise tax rate adjustments, ahead of inflation, to avoid increasing affordability over time driving consumption up again. • Adoption of a consistent rate of tax across all types of alcoholic beverages, based on alcohol content, as it is the alcohol that causes the harm and costs the country so dearly. Currently wine is undertaxed. While all alcohol has become much more affordable over the last 10 years, wine has outstripped all other types. • Introduction of a Minimum Unit Price for alcohol (a floor price for a standard 10g drink). There are two advantages of this, when used alongside increased excise. The primary purpose is to eliminate sources of very cheap alcohol that facilitate consumption of large volumes, and are a particular risk to young people. Secondly, having a MUP in place will avoid the expansion of the cheap end of the market when excise tax increases come into play. MUP should not be considered a substitute for increases in excise tax, as it does not have the same potential to reduce overall consumption. I would be happy for the Tax Working Group or Secretariat to contact me about anything relevant to their work.

JWx\_TaxReviewSubmission\_Housing\_v1.docx 1 / 2 Tax review submission paper - Housing. To : submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz From : Jan Wijninckx (pronounced Yan Vaynings), private citizen, small business owner. Date : 29-Apr-2018 Purpose : Suggestions to address imbalances turning NZ into a class society. 1. What I would like to see the tax working group address 1 the large and still growing imbalances between rich and poor resulting from 40 years of property speculation (which New Zealanders insist to call “investment”). 2 Change what you tax, to be ready for significant changes in employment due to rapidly increasing automation and robotics by businesses (Baxter the robot does not pay income tax). 2. Summary of suggestions To address the imbalances in housing ownership, ability for young people to buy, and disproportional wealth accumulation (“horizontal”): 1 Create an asset tax on all income generating property (houses, buildings, land etc, everything), collected every month, based on the GV and corrected by the monthly property in-/deflation. 2 Ensure property developers can write-off losses on one property development against other developments. 3 Taxing on shares and on bonds should be abolished, to promote investment in business, and level the playing field for all investment classes. At all cost, please avoid: 4 a capital gains tax on houses / a capital gains tax exempting the first home (point 1 above caters for it); if you do propose capital gains, it should not be linked to duration of ownership. 3. Rationale We have to do something about the tax system to promote building many more new houses, and stop the speculation on existing stock. With people earning something like 50k a year on average, a median house price of 800-900K is obscene. House prices are driven up by those that have some or many properties already (against which they can borrow more). There is no need for the tax payer to have to subsidize this wealth accumulation. Instead government and taxation rules should make sure that the supply side is lucrative, the circular investment in the same stock is penalised, in an attempt to rebalance house price affordability. In the past, negative gearing fuelled this boom in “investment” / speculation, where the “investor could write of “losses” against their personal income, using an LAQC, often reducing their tax bill to not paying any tax at all. This is how you accumulated 10 or more houses and a tax rort / subsidy. To close this loop-hole, the National government stopped the LAQC. I can totally understand that. However, property development is risky business and it would help if losses on one development JWx\_TaxReviewSubmission\_Housing\_v1.docx 2 / 2 can be offset against gains on other developments. Any other business can do exactly this, loses in the one, can be offset versus profits in the other. There is no need to single out developers, on the contrary, property development should be encouraged to increase supply, and that encouragement is enhanced by allowing losses to be offset. 3.1 Why an asset tax rather than a capital gains tax Capital gains tax will yield very little and only starts to work in the future. The housing market has a very high price elasticity: a one percent increase in demand causes bidding wars of desperate buyers and dramatic increases property costs as we have seen. We need to adjust the behaviour now, to ensure middle income / the next generation New Zealand can buy a house too, so we can’t wait for capital gains tax to kick-in in 5 to 10 years. Instead, I’d like to propose an asset tax, a tax which is regularly collected, i.e. monthly, and which is calculated on GV plus the in-/deflation since the most recent GV evaluation. It should apply to income generating assets and thereby exclude the home one lives in. By having an asset tax, we also start to prepare the tax collection for the significant changes in employment which are coming over the next five to ten years as a result of business automation and robotics. Baxter the robot does not pay income tax. Businesses which heavily automate remove tax payers. This trend is happening in law, in accounting, etc, as well as for blue collar workers such as those in forestry and shortly in fruit picking. As the state sees income from wages dwindle due to changes in employment, the tax revenue will need to shift from income to those that have the capital assets i.e. those that own Baxter, or any other income generating assets, like property. Having an asset tax without any exclusions will make this taxation very simple to administer. It would lead to the asset-rich having to fork out some money, rather than accumulate it, thus rebalancing inequality. It doesn’t need to be high, just high enough so that investing in people- activity based businesses becomes advantageous. Regarding property, the additional tax on assets can be compensated for by giving a similar reduction in tax on wage earnings. Having an asset tax as proposed here, will shift the behaviour of investors, and reduce the pressure on house speculation. A property speculator with 12 houses would pay a sizeable amount in tax, far more than would be offset by the reduced tax on his/her wages. If the asset tax level is just right, the property investor /speculator is encouraged to divest and re-invest in activity generating business for relative better performance. In addition, if tax on shares and on bonds is abolished (after six trades a year one is deemed a trader, which works against risk mitigation in share portfolios), investors would have other options to invest in (other than property) and thereby capitalize activity generating business. By having an asset tax which is collected monthly, government can take advantage of property inflation with immediate effect. This in itself would temper the inflation from property. It may even be an idea to let the reserve bank administer the tax rate to enable them to better manage inflation. 4.

JWx\_TaxReviewSubmission\_TaxIssues\_v1.docx 1 / 2 Tax review submission paper – Tax Issues. To : submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz From : Jan Wijninckx (pronounced Yan Vaynings), private citizen, small business owner. Date : 29-Apr-2018 Purpose : Suggestions to address imbalances and readying the tax system for the near future. 1. What I would like to see the tax working group address 1 For businesses under 20 people, waive “use of money interest” as it stalls business growth; 2 To redress “vertical” imbalances of double income earners versus single income earners, determine the tax bracket based on combined income of both partners. 3 Remove the irregularities of withholding income tax on contractor earnings, as this irregularity causes too much of an accounting headache and cost of accounting. 4 Force ACC to give an invoice with the full GST listed, to ease accounting and cost of accounting. 2. Rationale 2.1 Use of money interest In the third year of my business I was lucky and saw a significant increase in consulting sales over the year. The growth was luck and I could not forecast that. As a result, I got hammered with a large bill for use of money interest and had to pay additional provisional tax for the next year, despite having no guarantee that I would have a bumper year again. Instead of being happily in the plus, all of a sudden I was in negative cashflow territory. Every small business owner I know bitterly complains about this unfair tax. Many (myself included) will stop work / selling when we hit our forecast for the year, as the 2% per annum compounded (14% pa) is just not worth it. In some industries they do as much as possible in cash come January if they have hit their target to avoid this taxation. Revenue collection would significantly benefit from not having this penalty tax. No small business can forecast its growth, or accurately forecast the next year if one is small. As one grows one can be lucky and get awarded all the tenders, or none, or anything in-between. To grow fast is almost impossible due to this unfair tax, as resulting cashflow issues would be killing. For small business, tax should be settled at the end of the year without use of money penalties, on good faith. If you wish, settle twice a year, but no more than that. 2.2 Tax bracket based on combined income If in a household the two partners each earn 80k, their tax payment is substantially lower than for the household where one person works 12 hour days to earn the same 160k. To enable 12 hour days it is the partner who has to pick up the slack in the home and who then can’t earn money. This applies to most small business owners, including farmers; ours are man and wife businesses, yet IRD won’t let us pay each a salary of 80k. There is no “vertical” justness in this and this should be urgently addressed. It is also “vertically unjust” towards single income parents. High time for a change. JWx\_TaxReviewSubmission\_TaxIssues\_v1.docx 2 / 2 2.3 Remove the irregularities of withholding income tax on contractor earnings Now and then I get work through contracting agencies. The IRD has a new rule to deduct the tax at source by these agencies. However, this creates an accounting nightmare, until you get dispensation from this by filling in an IR 330. However, in the intermediate weeks that this takes, one has to have specials in the tax calculation for GST as the 15% rule does not apply to the net income received (to get the right GST it’s 40.243902...%). The result is additional time to compensate for broken rules, and additional cost for the accountant to fix it up, as well as overpaying tax as it is a flat 33% rate on all income without brackets. Please remove this rule as soon as you can. 2.4 ACC invoices are costly to account for as they don’t clearly state the GST Every year it is the same: ACC does not provide an invoice with transactional records showing cost records and for each the GST / or GST exempt status. Because they don’t do this, I have to pay the accountant additional time to sort this mess out. The IRD should tackle ACC over this, ACC should have to calculate and invoice GST properly like everyone else has to. 3.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Submission to Tax Working Group 2018 Company tax I support review the company/corporate tax rate and consideration for introducing variable tax rates based on annual turnover. For example slightly reduce the rate for smaller companies and slightly increase the rates for companies with higher turnover. This could assist in increasing the start-up of small businesses and provide increased employment. It would also decrease the tax burden on those owning smaller farms – young farmers and family farms. Review the ‘charity’ status of companies that are clearly profit making businesses rather than charities. For example ‘Sanitarium’ and the Gloriavale farms. They should be paying normal company and income tax rates. They use infrastructure paid for out of our taxes. Also review the tax status of large church groups as while they might make considerable profits from investments it is unclear whether those profits are used fro general community benefit. However I feel it is totally appropriate that charity organisations that run small businesses, such as selling second hand goods, to make money to use to support their charity work are not taxed. Urgently address the failure of some overseas companies to pay tax on the profits they make in New Zealand. Other I support the introduction of a capital gains tax or an equivalent tax. Income gained from speculation should be taxed just as personal income from employment is taxed, especially as those involved in such speculative activity are usually in upper income brackets. Exactly how this might be done I leave to those with greater expertise. I strongly support the introduction of an entry tax on tourist visitors – e.g. in the order of $50. I don’t believe it will stop many tourists coming here especially if they are notified in advance and given a brochure on entry explaining the reason for the tax and how it will be used. It is a small cost compared to air fares and other travel costs. It can then be used to support infrastructure used by tourists e.g. public facilities (toilets/local parks/rubbish collection), maintenance of national parks, walkways and accommodation, and maintenance of roads and public transport. 2 I also strongly support removing GST from fresh fruit and vegetables. I believe this is entirely doable and that these products are easily defined. I also support a tax on sugary drinks. There is clear evidence that, as one of a range of measures, this is effective in improving dental health and in reducing obesity over time. Besides which sugary drinks are a very poor form of nutrition and could be considered to be similar to alcohol and tobacco where increased tax leads to reduction in harmful use. Removal of GST from sanitary products should also be considered. I support the use of tax incentives to encourage tree planting especially in rural areas. Having grown up on a farm I am dismayed at the bare pastures and roadsides I see where there used to be many more trees providing shade and shelter for stock. I would also like to see tax incentives for smaller companies and for individuals to invest in electric vehicles, solar panels and storage batteries. I am aware that Dr Jan Wright was not in favour of household solar panel use but I believe that with the advent of reliable battery storage individual household use of solar power could be maximised. In contrast smaller businesses and light industry use most power in daylight hours so are good targets for incentivising solar power use. (I understand that Sylvia Park Shopping Centre in Auckland uses solar power and also provides free charging stations for electric vehicles.) One problem with this could be the reaction of the private power companies. Our experience was that about a year after installing solar panels on our new house the power company reduced the rate at which they paid us for the power we fed into the grid without consultation. Personal income tax While it is outside the scope of the Working Group’s review to increase any income tax rate I have included the following views as some of the reductions could be put in place if fiscally possible. These reductions could make a considerable difference to the rates of child poverty and family hardship. I believe it is unjust to tax those on benefits or very low incomes. Other countries such as Australia have an income threshold below which no tax is paid. This would also be fairer, simpler and more easily applied that ‘Working for Families’ having see the paperwork this involves. I also think that the tax income brackets and rates need adjusting. It is unfair that a family raising children and just getting by on a little over $48,000 gross income per year currently is paying only 3 cents in the dollar less in tax than those earning in the 100s of thousands of dollars per year. This is driving increasing inequality. Earnings from running such activities an Uber taxi or renting homes through Air BNB should also be taxed either through adding to personal tax income or to personal business income. 3 I would support changes something in the order of the following: No tax on earnings under $15,000. 12.5% on earnings above $15,000 and up to $50,000. 25% on earnings above $50,000 and up to $100,000. 35% on earnings over $100,000 and up to $250,000. 50% on earnings over $250,000. Possible even consider a higher rate for those earning over $500,000. Tax incentives to save for retirement are a useful idea but maybe most equitably applied only to those in lower income brackets. This is a more complex topic. Means testing for superannuation is a ‘can of worms’ and may be better approached through taxation on superannuation. Dr Karla Rix-Trott \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Kia ora, This is a big opportunity to both correct some very serious anomalies in our tax system and to create a tax system for the challenges of the 21 st century. NZ was quite an innovator back in the '80s, both in monetary and fiscal policy. Some of that was good, some not. I truly hope that you folks are courageous and seize this opportunity and offer truly innovative (even radical) proposals. Executive summary I feel that NZ's tax system is too weighted towards taxing labour and not enough to taxing wealth and 'bads' such as sugar and pollution. It also seems that some of the richest individuals and corporations (particularly multinationals) are able to avoid paying a legitimate tax rate here. I'm proposing a lot of changes, but I think the level of tax is about right (but it could also be a little higher since the previous Government neglected so many things)—so I would aim for tax-neutrality overall. Increase the tax take by adding new taxes, but reduce the income tax, particularly on those with lower incomes, and lower GST taxes. -First, I would like to suggest an Automatic Payment Tax (APT) and a reduction in the GST. -To reduce Wealth Inequality, I would suggest a Wealth Tax and an Empty Homes Tax. -To bring down the high cost of land in NZ, I would propose a Land Tax, a high stamp duty on land purchased by foreigners (as other jurisdictions have done) and limits on the tax deductibility of interest payments which has led to over-gearing both in business and property investment. -To capture more of the revenue earned in NZ but shifted to low-tax jurisdictions, I would like to see a Revenue Tax on Digital Multinational Corporations and a punitive tax on all multinationals that divert profits to lower-tax jurisdictions. -I would like to see sugar taxes or a 'junk food' tax and a zero GST on healthy/low-processed foods. -I would like to see much more use of pollution/environmental taxes to encourage the efficient use of resources and reduce the production of waste and pollution. -I would also like to propose that the revenue from some of these taxes go to local government instead of the national government. Local government needs more revenues sources than they have at present and our national government is disproportionately powerful by international standards. As a Cantabrian, I feel that my tax money goes to Wellington and then gets handed on to Auckland and as Auckland grows in population and therefore political power, this will only increase. Auckland certainly needs more revenue sources for their infrastructure problems, but the rest of the country shouldn't be forced to subsidise Auckland. Specifically, I prefer the revenue from the Empty Home Tax and the Land Tax (or Stamp Duty) to go to the city council or regional council where the land is located. The Wealth Tax revenue could be directed to the local government where the individual lives. Just to give some background on myself. I pay about $4000 a year in rates and about $60,000 a year in income taxes, so my income is well above the national average and I would be subject to a wealth tax with a $1million threshold, lest you think that I want someone else to be taxed for what I'm proposing. I am happy to pay taxes; it is how we pay for a good society. There are many things that private business and free markets will not produce because there isn't a sufficient return on capital and so government must provide these things or our society suffers. I do, however, expect efficient government and effective use of all our tax dollars. More Detailed Discussion Automatic Payment Tax (APT): I would like to see something like the APT. This is more broad than the Financial Transaction Tax as an APT would apply to all transfers, not just financial ones. It is not about curbing speculation (though it would probably have some effect) but more about a very small tax applied to the broadest base possible. This would raise a lot of revenue allowing a reduction in the GST or raising the current income tax brackets, (or perhaps a zero tax bracket for the first few thousand earned) or both. Wealth Tax (vs Capital Gains Tax): I'm not a big fan of a CGT as it is really a transaction tax. If there is no transaction, there is no tax due. Assets can grow and grow in value and remain tax free if there is no sale. Also, the middle class is quite right to be concerned about this tax as they are more likely to be forced to liquidate an investment due to a change of circumstances. The rich typically can borrow against equity or just have the cash flow to meet unexpected bills. Also because the CGT is infrequent, (sometimes delayed for years or decades), when the tax falls due it is for a large amount (sometimes millions). So, the taxpayer is very motivated to put in place tax avoidance systems. The same is true for an estate tax. So I prefer a Wealth Tax with a generous threshold that exempts roughly 80% of Kiwis, then an annual small charge, probably 1%. (it could be progressive, increasing the % at higher levels of wealth). This would exempt those with a small or moderate amount of assets and is more likely to actually be collected from the rich. NZ already has something similar in the FIF, with a $50,000 threshold is likely to only be paid by wealthy individuals and if you're in the 33% bracket, that works out to a 1.6% tax rate (33% x 5% implied dividend rate). So arguably NZ already has a wealth tax, it only applies to one type of asset. Gareth Morgan's proposed CCIT operates similarly to the FIF, applying an implied income rate to all assets coupled with a reduction of taxes on earned income to achieve a tax reduction for about 80% of people and a 20% increase on the wealthy. I like his proposal, but most people don't seem interested or are frightened of the family home being included in the calculation. Finally, I know the TWG are required to exempt the family home from a CGT, but I don't agree with that. The richer you are and the more lavish your home, the bigger the tax benefit. This exclusion applies equally to John Key's $20million Parnell home and a $200,000 home in Invercargill. The US CGT allows you to defer the tax if you buy a home of equal or greater value within 2 years of sale and then when you finally down-size to a smaller home (typically at retirement), each person has a very generous, once-in-a-lifetime exclusion from the tax; a couple has two. So most Americans don't pay CGT on their home. This system would completely shelter most Kiwis from paying the CGT on their home, but would offer little protection to John and Bronie Key. We also need to close the loopholes in the income tax system that allow income shifting (for example the high proportion of the rich list that aren't in the top bracket). Empty Homes Tax: This tax is both aimed at reducing wealth inequality and improving home affordability. A 1% tax on residential properties, in cities, is due on homes unoccupied longer than 4 months. In Vancouver, owners must submit an annual property status declaration. We'll need stiff penalties for dishonesty and even stiffer penalties for faking the appearance of occupancy (lights or water on timers) and rewards for reporting law-breakers. Land Tax, Stamp Duty on foreign land purchasers, Limits on Interest Deduction: I know this is an issue for farmers as they feel they will effectively be taxed twice, but my concern is that the price of land (urban-particularly Auckland) and agricultural has become so distorted and over-valued that the next generation has no possibility of owning their own home or farm. This has happened due to the current tax anomalies, namely tax-free capital gains, tax incentives to over- gear, corporate ownership tax benefits, tax-free land-banking and unfettered foreign purchase. I would prefer a total ban on foreigners buying land in NZ (leasing would be permitted), but that may prove difficult to implement. Apparently a hefty stamp duty can have a similar effect. Many other countries have similar rules. Currently, Kiwis must compete against the wealthy of the world and it's just not fair. We must takes steps to correct these distortions so the next generation can afford the opportunities that are their birthright. This should also include stiff penalties (I like confiscation of the property) for law-breakers and stiff penalties for real estate agent, lawyers and Kiwi front-men who enable the evasion. Lord Adair Turner (in Between Debt and the Devil) describes excessive debt as a form of pollution that creates systemic financial risk. Debt as part of capital structure is being overdone due to the tax incentives. Gearing already enhances the returns to equity; tax deductibility just throws petrol on the fire. This encourages over-gearing to avoid tax on earned income in favour of chasing capital gains and puts business and households at risk in an economic downturn. He proposes reforms to reduce the bias toward leveraged real estate investment in personal tax regimes and limits on the tax deductibility if corporate leverage exceeds certain limits. He also proposes more favourable treatment of dividends, however as NZ has integration, that is probably enough. We need to limit corporate interest deductibility to a reasonable amount and ring-fence deductions vis-a-vis earned income. Multinational Tax Avoidance Multinationals are competing against domestic business and yet often paying little or no tax here. Tax revenue is lost and it is not a level-playing field. Apparently India has recently adopted a 6% tax on turnover. That sounds like a good idea. We need taxes based on turnover and revenue rather than net profit as they are gaming the current system. We also need something like the Diverted Profits Tax in Australia and the UK that assesses a penalty rate if companies under-report income vis-a-vis revenue. Taxing 'Bads' First, I think the taxes on tobacco need to be reduced. I have never smoked so I don't pay this tax, but it is obvious that the tax is leading to violent dairy robberies and a black market trade. Those who still smoke are not deterred by the tax and need other treatments or incentives. Or they may just be hard-core addicts who cannot stop and the tax simply diverts more of their income to smokes, rather than other uses. The increasing rate of tax is ineffective at deterring smoking and has become counter-productive. Sugar, salt and low-grade fats are cheap ingredients for processed food manufacturers. It is good for their profits and bad for our health and is driving up the costs of NZ's health system. As we've seen from Mexico and now the UK, these taxes are effective at driving manufacturers to re- formulate their products and reduce general consumption of damaging, empty calories. Denmark had a tax on saturated fat (which they repealed due to corporate pressure). It raised a lot of revenue and blood tests from the health system were starting to show a reduction in blood cholesterol levels. There is the perennial debate about removing GST from healthy foods. Supposedly this is too difficult or will spoil the elegant simplicity of the GST tax. I don't buy that. We've got bar codes and computers that can easily keep track of differential tax rates. Then there's the claim that there will be endless debates about what should qualify for the exemption. This is a more valid argument, but there are whole aisles in the supermarket that are unquestionably junk. There will be areas of debate (real fruit juice springs to mind-it has a terrible GI, but lots of people think it's healthy). I would suggest using the UK's traffic light system, green is exempt from GST, yellow has the regular rate, red foods are double. I don't see why that would be so difficult to implement. Alcohol is currently taxed adequately in my opinion. The problem is the alco-pops and RTDs, not a $20 bottle of wine or a bottle of cognac. We should tax the sugar (and packaging), rather than increasing the tax on the alcohol. Environmental Taxes...we need a whole rafts of these. A Climate Change Levy such as the UK has and/or a Carbon Tax (which I prefer to an ETS) with tax credits for investments that reduce greenhouse gas emission. A levy on nitrate fertiliser ($2/kg) again with rebates for off-setting behaviour. A levy on all single-use plastics (not just shopping bags), glass bottles and aluminium cans. Most of these things have a barcode on them so the charge is applied at purchase (levied on the manufacturer to encourage package redesign) and refunded when returned to a recycling program, much like Germany has had for quite a while. We also need an up-front 'end of use/disposal' levy on things like tyres and electronics. A 1cent/1000L levy on commercial water use (including agriculture) is for fair use of a national asset, owned in common by all the people of Aotearoa. It should not be given away for free. That was acceptable in the past, but the resources is now at risk and the rules need to change. There is the issue of iwi rights, but I think a reasonable division of the revenue should be possible. That becomes another source of money for them and for the Crown. To continue to do nothing, is frankly stupid. The idea that such a levy will significantly raise the cost of food or drinks is absurd. It doesn't take 1000L of water to grow a lettuce or a bottle of wine. If such a miniscule levy has any perceptible effect, it's because there's something seriously wrong with your systems or you're using a ridiculous amount of water for whatever you're producing. Finally, we need a Tourist Eco tax to help pay for the damage tourism is causing and to provide the infrastructure needed to support this part of our economy. The burden shouldn't fall on local rate- payers. Campervans rentals should have an additional levy to discourage freedom camping (which i s t o t a l l y o u t o f h a n d

THE SUBMSISSIONS TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP (TWG) FROM LOWELL MANNING 30 APRIL 2018 ABOUT THE WRITER: Lowell Manning has tertiary qualifications in Civil Engineering, Sociology and Psychology and has run a small construction business for about forty years. From 1986-late 1992 he was on the executive of the Electoral Reform Coalition, chairing it from 1990 until August 1992 when the then National government formally pledged to hold referenda on proportional representation in 1992 and 1993. For most of the period 1986-2005 he was on the executive of the New Zealand Democratic Party and for most of that time chaired its policy committee. He was on the Alliance executive and policy committee for most of the period from its formation in late 1990 until early 2005. He has had no political party affiliation since early 2005. He is presently president of Basic Income New Zealand Incorporated, a non- partisan organisation established in 2015 to promote the introduction of basic income in New Zealand. DISCLAIMER: These submissions are made as a private submitter and do not purport to reflect the views of Basic Income New Zealand Incorporated, its committee or its members. CO-SIGNATARIES: Sue Hammill (Whakatane), Te Rangikaheke Kiripatea (Rotorua), Michael Kane (Wellington) 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Transformation begins with a change in thinking. The world is facing major changes. Alongside the rapidly worsening disconnects between work, jobs, incomes and taxes that are rapidly increasing the vulnerability and marginalisation of many if not most workers, there are the growing impacts of climate change, pollution and automation. Business as usual, in the form of existing monetary and economic policy and tax settings are unlikely to be sufficient to deal with the major changes that are upon us. The 5-10 year time frame the TWG is asked to consider “in particular” will need to embody transformative approaches to government funding, income security and the relationships among the four capitals if there are to be meaningful responses to the issues while keeping total tax at “around its historical level”. Otherwise there will be no money to deal with them. Transformation does not happen by itself. It involves thinking that extends outside the existing ideology and economic dogma that some see as an underlying cause of income and wealth inequality and the social, human and environmental deficits we see around us. \[1\] Some of the integrated submissions in this document may at first sight appear unorthodox. We need perhaps to try something different because the current orthodox approach has led us to where we are now. We can do better. The submissions are not meant to be definitive. They can be adapted, mixed and matched any way TWG thinks fit. They show how full income support replacement + $60/week + across the board indexation at 5%/year can be introduced without any net tax increases whatever. After 10 years the income security (basic income) for a family of two adults and two children could be about $1330/week, achieved without any substantive increase in taxation. That is an astoundingly different outcome from the current objections to basic income on the basis of cost. The submissions also provide for transformational redistribution of income that will be needed for the economy to adjust to the impacts of automation on the one hand and the restoration of the public commons, especially the physical, social and human environments on the other hand and the vast resources that will be needed to progress that restoration. This can all be done within a high growth economy where the growth is directed toward the “goods” of the four capitals rather than the “bads” as has been the case in recent decades. By “goods” I mean improvements that enhance our collective wellbeing. By “bads” I mean the impacts that detract from our collective wellbeing like crime, violence, ill health, pollution and much more. Only 3 of the submissions below involve additional tax spending. The first is submission 3 that seeks to restore tax to its historical level of around 33% of GDP that is still below the level of most countries we compare ourselves with. Of the 32 countries listed in the submissions background paper (Figure 2 data) only 9 have tax levels below 32%, the main one being Australia (28.2%). (The others are Ireland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Turkey, US and Chile). New Zealand is listed at 33% for 2015. The second is at Submission 16 where the amount needed for indexation could exceed the savings from across-the board implementation of the basic income at least in the early years. The indexation might require a temporary increase in tax from 33% towards 34% but there are other options such as reducing the indexation below 5% for a year or two. The third is the cost to government of increasing the minimum wage (submission 18). Indexation of the minimum wage is assumed to be funded from the natural tax increase from growth.

TERMS OF REFERENCE The Terms of Reference (ToR) released by Hon Grant Robertson Minister of Finance on Thursday 23 November 2017 as updated 8 March 2018 place increasing the rate of GST, inheritance tax, taxing the family home/land and adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system outside the scope of the TWG review. At the same time, the ToR specify that total tax should remain “around its historical level of 30% of GDP”. That means that under the ToR the TWG is focused on the “structure, fairness and balance” of the tax system in a way that promotes economic sustainability and productivity, and that is balanced, efficient and fair with “special regard to housing affordability”. The tax and transfer system is to be “progressive”. In assessing fairness, “income, assets and wealth”, the balance between the “productive economy and the speculative economy” and the “integrity of the income tax system” in relation to the” taxing \[of\] companies, trusts and individuals” are to be considered. The TWG is to consider “in particular” a 5-10 year time frame, taxing capital gains/land “or other housing tax measures” (other than the family home), progressive company tax and the role tax can play in delivering “positive environmental and ecological outcomes”. 3. THE BACKGROUND PAPER AND DATA I found the Submissions Background Paper (SBP) to be thorough, informative and well presented. it does, however, have one major drawback in that the submitter is being invited to consider the ToR issues on the basis of the current economic ideology as it has been adopted around the world. The comparative data is impressive and it is natural to compare New Zealand’s tax system with other systems as they are today. Showing how New Zealand is faring against other countries in current market, social and environmental outcomes may not be of much help if those outcomes reflect a common ideological status quo. The SBP background data show hints of longitudinal profiles in Figures 1, 3, 12 and 13 that go back to the period before the election of the Labour Government in 1984 when the economy had a rather different “shape” than it has today; that the current policy settings are not the only ones possible. In Figure 13, for example, inequality has increased sharply since the neoliberal reforms were implemented. It is possible that the longitudinal comparative data for New Zealand may be as important as the contemporary international comparative data when considering the issues raised by the ToR. SUBMISSION 1. That TWG gives at least equal weight to comparative consideration of the historical tax system and social outcomes in New Zealand as it does to comparative consideration of the current tax systems and social outcomes elsewhere. 4. AN INCONSISTENCY IN THE TERMS OF REFERENCE The statement in the ToR that tax should be “around its historical level of 30% of GDP” is inaccurate. According to the data for SBP Figure 3 the average tax to GDP ratio from 1986-2014 (29 years) was 33.42%. I haven’t found any evidence of a historical level of “around 30%” over the past 30 years. In 2016 the figure was 32.1%. The only years when tax was “around 30%” were 2009-2011 when the recent national-led government introduced tax cuts beginning 1 April 2009. Those percentages increased in the following years despite efforts to constrain spending. The tax cuts proposed by the National-led government for the 2018-19 fiscal year would have again brought the current figure somewhat closer to 30% but they have been cancelled by the new Labour-led government. The term “around 30%” condemns New Zealand to the ongoing austerity and relatively “small” government that are hallmarks of neoliberal ideology. The current GDP is in excess of $270 billion. 3.4% (33.42%-30%) of that is more than $9 billion. That is enough to keep New Zealand’s health and education systems running smoothly, enable the new Government’s Best Start for young people to be progressively extended to age 18 and much more. I appreciate that the TWG remit is about the structure of the tax system rather than the amount of tax but it is reasonable for TWG to promote compliance with the government’s own ToR. I’m concerned that by stating what appears to be an arbitrary tax “goal” the ToR might be unnecessarily hindering the TWG considerations. SUBMISSION 2. That TWG seeks clarification from the government on the ToR wording that limits tax to the historically inaccurate figure of “around 30% of GDP”. SUBMISSION 3 That depending on the clarification in Submission 2, TWG recommends to the government to restores taxation to the historical level (say, 33%) by way of introducing capital gains and/or asset taxes on all other assets (including equities) other than the family home. Explanation: One form of capital gains tax was proposed by Labour in 2014 but it was not well articulated and later withdrawn. The absence of capital gains tax does provide free riding for investors who tend to also be in the upper income groups. It is not unreasonable to apply capital gains tax on assets, including equities not being traded by entities subject to business taxation. Many countries New Zealand compares itself to, do. The tax income generated, say, up to 3% of GDP or about $8 billion/year once the policy is fully implemented. That is enough to restore New Zealand’s health, education and social services to the level the country enjoyed prior to the on-going austerity measures of past governments. 5. THE FOUR CAPITALS I understand and support the use by Treasury of the Living Standards Framework (LSF) and the four capital stocks: Social Capital, Natural capital, Human capital, and Financial and Physical Capital and I understand that its implementation is a work in progress. Adopting the LSF means the “established criteria that have been used in past tax reviews” (SBP p19) may no longer be sufficient for purpose. There is a risk that the historical criteria might somehow take priority over consideration of the capital stocks unless the foci of the criteria are amended. “\[T\]o “maximise national welfare” no longer means considering only financial and physical capital as has been the case in the past. The terms “efficiency”, “equity and fairness”, “integrity” “fiscal adequacy” and “coherence” urgently need to be reassessed when maximising national welfare within the far broader context the LSF requires. The Living Standards Framework suggests a profound shift in the way tax is considered and the way the “established criteria” have been interpreted. I give just one example to illustrate the point. In New Zealand “fairness” appears to have been interpreted to mean “as near equal tax rates as possible” whereas in most of the developed world (especially Europe) the criterion is interpreted to mean “tax rates according to ability to pay”. The income and other tax structures in many comparable countries are quite different from ours. Many have much higher effective marginal tax rates on higher incomes (generally 45% or more) and much lower effective marginal tax rates on lower incomes than we do. Some, like France also have a variety of other taxes on capital gains and wealth. Referring to overall tax levels as in SBP Figure 5, is insufficient. I submit that the New Zealand interpretation of the “established criteria” needs to diverted away from the current economic agenda that, due to its emphasis on economic austerity, is fundamentally antithetical to the LSF. SUBMISSION 4. That to maximise national welfare the “established criteria” for tax (SBP p19), particularly what is referred to as “vertical equity”, be reassessed to more appropriately redistribute the tax burden from low income earners to high income earners and the investment sector. 6. REVERSING THE ONGOING ENCLOSURE (PRIVATISATION) OF THE COLLECTIVE COMMONS The dominant, albeit usually unspoken, rationale underpinning most modern tax systems, and especially the New Zealand tax system, is the enclosure of our collective commons for private profit. While the process of enclosure has been ongoing for thousands of years it has accelerated exponentially over the past several decades. By enclosure I refer to the privatisation for economic rent of the primary elements that together comprise the four capitals. The process is driven by the “dominant revenue” of French economist Francois Perroux. By “dominant revenue” Perroux means the asymmetrical power, wealth and income wielded by the small elite, (the 1% of the Occupy movement) that, for the time being, most strongly influences government, business and finance. The main difference between the dominant revenue of the past and that of the present is that today’s dominant revenue pervades every aspect of our daily lives. Most of our collective commons that can be monetised for profit have been or are being monetised for profit. As our commons are consumed for private gain, the waste and degradation that private use generates is left behind in the form of human, social, natural and financial and physical public losses. The losses are treated as “externalities”. Introduction of the Living Standards Framework means that what are presently uncounted externalities will have to be valued. The public at large who collectively own the commons can reasonably expect appropriate rent for their ongoing use and restoration of past damage based on their true value. One form of payment might be in the form of a basic income for all. By basic income I mean an unconditional, universal and regular payment made as of right to every legal resident. Payments for ongoing use could be levelled against the productive economy. Payments for past damage and restitution for past use could be levied against the investment sector as a whole that has accumulated wealth, income and power from the ongoing process of enclosure. The level of uncounted externalities is stupendous. Applying the LSF suggests that quite different thinking is needed and that the existing economic and social modelling is well and truly outdated and needs to be abandoned without delay. To illustrate my point, I list some of the public commons that have been enclosed or are being progressively enclosed. It is far from complete and is offered to disclose the global reach of privatisation within the capitalist system. - Human Capital: Enforced work in a low wage low productivity economy resulting in structural unemployment and poverty. The annual current externality in New Zealand is more than 4.6% (structural unemployment) x $270 billion (GDP) or $12 billion. There are also immense losses from the enclosure of knowledge represented by patents, copyrights and the like that restrict competition and, in many cases, seriously inflate prices. There is also widespread use of unpaid work and further large externalities created through reduced mental and physical health and insufficient education and training. - Financial Capital (money): nearly all money is bank money in the form of electronic cash LENT into circulation for profit. Public or sovereign money is/would be the same electronic cash SPENT into circulation without net cost. Private bank money is radical, an historic anomaly (dating from 1694); public money is the historical norm and has been around for thousands of years. The annual current externality is more than 1.75% (the OCR) x $500 billion (domestic credit) or $9 billion. The 1956 “Report of the Royal Commission on the Monetary, Banking and Credit Systems” was explicit at Paragraph 438: “There is, of course the possibility of bringing about the necessary expansion of the money supply entirely by financing government expenditure from Reserve Bank credit, and by at the same time preventing trading banks from expanding their lending through a rigid application of the reserve ratio”. I emphasis that trillions of dollars of quantitative easing as public money is sometimes called these days has been issued by central banks around the world in recent years. I also emphasise that public money does not need to be issued at zero coupon rate (zero interest). In the past, (in 1956 for example) when public money was still used to exchange goods and services, much of the economy was still cash based, bank debt levels were numerically low, most investment was done on a Savings and Loan basis and the publicly owned Bank of New Zealand was by far the largest trading bank. The Royal Commission declined to recommend the use of the Reserve Bank public money on grounds of maintaining competition in the financial sector. These days the situation in 1956 has been reversed. The economy is entirely dependent on bank debt, the use of non-bank cash has been almost eliminated and there is very little competition from within the public sector. To provide and maintain competition in the financial sector we submit public money should be used. - Physical Capital (Infrastructure): The rent paid on privatised strategic public assets (ports, airports, energy, resources, roads, rail, Air NZ, BNZ, NZ Steel, Telecom and many more) is substantial. I acknowledge differing views about such sales and the use, for example, of “Public Private Partnerships” but there is little doubt they have been ideologically motivated. The loss to the public is (in round terms) their annual return on investment plus at least some of their capital gains. I have not attempted to assess the annual value of the externality but it is likely to be $billions. - Natural capital: The literal enclosure, seizure, colonisation and use of land, resources, water, air, biodiversity and their permanent loss or degradation. Militarism and war are also an enclosure of natural capital though they do not (fortunately) currently apply to New Zealand. The natural externalities are becoming the subject of wider public debate as the vast costs of remediation become better understood. Efforts are underway to begin remediation, much of that on the basis of voluntary effort which, itself, can be considered a form of enclosure. The annual costs of just a small part of the externalities, namely pollution and waste, far exceed any current taxpayer funded budgets for them. Their annual value can safely also be counted in many billions of dollars. The total externalities under natural capital clearly add up to a substantial share of national output. - Social Capital: The externalities from the enclosure of social capital arise from the breakdown of family and community and the resulting violence and alienation, crime and substance abuse throughout society. The common human values of caring, community and creativity (Max Harris, “The New Zealand Project”) have been progressively eroded by the emphasis on selfishness, competition and individual gain embodied in the neoliberal economic and social models promoted by the Mont Pelerin Society and Ayn Rand. The social externality costs are also very large and represent a substantial part of the health, prison, social development and courts budgets. In addition, the annual externality cost of family violence alone has been estimated to be between $4 billion and $7 billion https://nzfvc.org.nz/news/report-identifies-economic-cost-family-violence-new- zealand - Trade: The enclosure of trade and traditional business itself through corporatisation, mergers, takeovers and multinational trade agreements traverses the boundaries of the four capitals. We submit that trade is fine but the use of trade to externalise costs both at home and abroad is not. Privatisation of trade is particularly egregious when corporations are given rights, such as those in Investor-State Disputes Settlement clauses that can overrule national and international law. Such trade agreements are not about trade: they are about the exercise of the “dominant revenue” on a world scale. Cumulatively, the annual public loss from privatisation and enclosure is likely to exceed 10% of GDP. We submit there are ways for the TWG to respond to such a monumental task within the ToR. SUBMISSION 5. That GST be replaced with a 5% Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) automatically deducted whenever money leaves a bank account (unless it is a transfer between accounts in the same name(s)). Explanation: It may be that FTT has been avoided in the past because it proportionately taxes the investment sector. In terms of tax fairness and equity a powerful case is being made throughout the developed world that the investment sector should be taxed as well as incomes. One basis for establishing the TWG appears to be to bring some degree of balance between the “productive economy and the speculative economy”. Historically the tax system has developed incrementally layer by layer guided principally by the ability to collect the various taxes and by the power of the “dominant revenue” to directly tax toward those least able to pay them, or at least away from the dominant revenue. If TWG accepts the time has come to step away from current neoliberal thinking, FTT is one great opportunity to do so. The FTT would broaden the tax base to about 1.6 x GDP when all investment transactions are included. I assume short term speculative transactions would disappear. 5% FTT would raise about 1.6 x 5% x $270 b GDP or $21.6 billion in revenue. The net revenue will be 21.6- 20.6 (GST 2017) = $1 billion which would offer a minor but not substantive increase in tax revenue that could potentially be offset by reductions in other taxes. Since the FTT is a layered tax rather than a “pass the parcel” tax like GST, there may be some one-off inflation as the FTT is initially worked through intermediate production stages. The inflation will be less than the 10% price reduction for most consumers (15% GST-5% FTT) by the proportion of FTT paid by the investment sector. FTT favours local production over complex goods and services with multiple stages and high transport costs so it has positive regional development outcomes. FTT is transformative as it shifts the tax burden away from ordinary consumption toward investment. It reduces the tax burden on low income earners and those with little or no wealth (as shown on SBP Figure 17). For others it conceptually replaces GST in substantial part with a combined capital gains/wealth tax with 100% progressivity because FTT is collected only when money is spent. Since it is collected automatically there is considerable saving to business and government alike from reduced compliance and administration costs. FTT is a powerful disincentive to speculation, particularly housing speculation. With respect to the family home, FTT can perhaps be viewed as a one-off stamp duty applied on a generally similar scale to that used in Australia except that in some places there the first home is exempt and the stamp duty is applied on a sliding scale. The only way to avoid FTT is to revert to cash transactions. Few will do that with the FTT set at around 5% but if they did, one response would be to be to remove $50 and $100 notes from circulation. That would suit the banks well and potentially also reduce crime and black-market activity by encouraging those holding notes for criminal use to “wash” them through the banks. I submit that the 5% FTT proposed above could be the start of a wider process whereby in future all tax other than social. pollution and resource taxes (collected at source) could be replaced by FTT. There need be no company tax, no personal tax and no GST. In 2017 (from SBP Figure 4), the FTT would become a flat tax of about 17.5% on all transactions based on total transactions of 1.6 x GDP. The saving in this to individuals, business and government is truly immense as large parts of the services sector (IRD, accountancy, legal, administration) would become redundant. The savings are theoretically quantifiable and would surely run to tens of billions of dollars annually. SUBMISSION 6. That human capital be respected and improved by the introduction of a basic income to replace all income support such that household incomes remain the same as they do now whether or not those in the household have paid work. Explanation: Basic income in this proposal refers to “an individual regular and unconditional payment made as of right to all legal residents that is sufficient to meet their basic needs and participate in their communities”. Fully respecting the ToR, the basic income I propose here is both income and tax neutral as shown as a first approximation in Table 1. Table 1 does not include the government’s Best Start programme that is a “add-on” universal payment for young children over and above the neutral basic income in Table 1 TABLE 1.

In New Zealand, income support includes Superannuation, family tax credits, in-work tax credits, and the main benefits including jobseeker, sole parent, young parent/youth \[treated as adults if living independently\], supported living payment (93000 at cost $1.536 billion 2017) . orphans/unsupported child, student allowances, veterans. These are included in Table 1. Some extra individual specific temporary benefits like childcare assistance, disability assistance, hardship assistance, (total $1.20 billion 2017) and Accommodation Assistance ($1.11 billion 2017) are excluded. Child support payments are not included. There will be minor additional funding needed for (mostly small) groups that do not fall readily into the household framework shown in Table 1. For example, youths 16/17 years old living independently might be classed as adults. The single adult basic income is higher than existing student and young adult allowances and that difference paid to students and young adults may need to be funded or a separate basic income created for them. The orphan’s/unsupported child benefit is quite a bit higher than the child basic income so a separate provision might need to be made for them. Multiple families living in a single dwelling might be treated as separate households or a separate provision could be created for them too. The SLadd-on BI in Table 1 is not a perfect match but it is a reasonable first approximation. The separate basic income applying universally to the different categories in Table 1 result from the complexity of the current income support system. Some consolidation may be possible. I have not done that as it would compromise the strict neutrality of the proposal. Because of the proposal’s universality, budget neutrality, and net-income neutrality the tax rates on earned income would be increased to offset the basic income paid to income earners. The process is set out in the following expressions: Existing income support + Existing earned income – Existing tax = Basic income + Existing earned income – New tax (A) By definition, no additional funding beyond existing income support is needed in expression (A). There is no change to net household income when the basic income is introduced. If there is no earned income, as in existing beneficiary households, (and so no earned income tax) expression (A) becomes: Existing income support = Basic income (B) From expression (A), the tax in households that get some of their income from income support such as tax credits and some of their income from earned income will increase by an amount equal to their basic income less their current income support. Extra tax on existing earned income = Basic income – Existing income support 2 (C) Such a “bottom line” (budget neutral) basic income would apply to all households whatever their earned incomes are now or may become at any time in the future. It provides all the benefits of basic income except that it does not directly reduce poverty or inequality because there is no income redistribution. There is no risk in this to either the government or those participating in the trial. 2 A policy decision will be needed to apportion existing income support where there is more than one income earner in the household. One solution would to apportion the income support pro rata with earned income. The tax “claw back” in expressions (A) and (C) is simply the mechanism used to maintain existing incomes. It does not change the household financial outcome. An indicative first approximation of individualised tax on earned income is shown in Figure 1. The tax on total income including the basic income does not change. The peaks shown in Figure 1 (which is indicative only) for those on low earned income ($600/week) relate to the ability to earn some income before benefit abatement starts and the current effective marginal tax rates on that income and relevant income support payments. The peaks may be inaccurate and need further work. In practice there could be some smoothing of the curves. To maintain neutrality and keep the proposal strictly within the ToR, this has not been done in Figure 1. The income and tax neutral basic income could be initiated by a permanent trial in one or more electorates, such as, for example, East Coast, before being progressively expanded across the country. To achieve fairness and equity the basic income would be indexed at a rate equal to the indexation of current income support. Preferably both existing income support and the basic income should, we submit, be indexed by least the rate of nominal GDP growth.

Individualisation of tax on paid work is simple to manage by way of a tax calculator or equivalent. Technology to do this is already available. The primary data needed is the household structure for each address. The evidence supporting the implementation of basic income may be well-known to the TWG members. On an income neutral level, basic income is about the emancipatory effects of the proposal. As Professor Guy Standing who is perhaps the leading world authority on basic income said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 2016: “We have done pilots, covering thousands of people and most fundamentally we found that the emancipatory value of a basic income is greater than the money value. It gives people a sense of control of their time, so that the values of work grow relative to the demands of labour. The values of learning and public participation grow, the values of citizenship are strengthened ....” . Basic income can be a major factor in improving human capital. Aside from the manifold measurable emancipatory effects from its introduction there are substantial measurable monetary savings too. ADMINISTRATION Once the trial starts, most of the administration can be done by the staff no longer needed for existing WINZ functions. With the basic income in place only the accommodation supplement, special benefits and child youth and family issues will need to be administered through the existing WINZ offices. That way many staff can be retained for when the proposed trial ends (if it does). ESTABLISHMENT EXPENSES FOR INITIAL ELECTORATE TRIAL Estimating the research and establishment expenses for an electorate level trial is beyond the scope of this work. They can be broadly divided into the operational elements. They appear to be in the millions or low tens of millions of dollars. (East Coast: 95000 people, 35000 households, 27000 children) i) Electoral roll: Provide to enrol those not enrolled and check accuracy of current enrolment. Create online and written forms for change of address and make them readily available. ii) Create household register: This can be done together with i) but it is a bigger job. The starting data is electoral roll + previous census. A check for the number of children is available from the population age distributions and school rolls. The Ministry for Social Development and Revenue Department already have a range of data for those currently receiving income support but that information may need to be upgraded and collated. Create online and written forms for changes to household structure, distribute them to households and develop procedures for processing the changes. iii) Births and deaths: Create cross-linkage between existing registry and household register. iv) Opt-out: Create online and written “opt-out” form (if desired) and internal process for applying it. v) Bank accounts: Co-ordinate with Kiwibank. Create bank accounts and distribute cards and develop the process for paying basic income into the bank accounts. This basically involves adapting what is already in place. Provide advice and assistance to those who do not presently use debit cards. Ensure ATM machines are available and accessible throughout the trial area. vi) Migration to and from the trial area: This would be done as part of ii). vii) There are existing processes for travel abroad and other temporary absences that can be adapted to the trial. viii) Fraud: A separate audit unit might be established to check for abuse of the household structure when claiming the basic income. Otherwise the existing provisions for investigation and compliance could be adapted to fit. ix) Legislative expenses: The trial will need enabling legislation to authorise the systemic changes and taxation provisions. x) Research and evaluation: There will be some additional research and evaluation expenses because the trial will be running in parallel with the existing nationwide income support system. xi) Adjust the tax provisions. Create online tax calculator and tax booklet for distribution to businesses and households. xii) There will be modest staff retraining costs MEASURING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF AN ELECTORATE LEVEL BASIC INCOME TRIAL This submission cannot offer a detailed benefit/cost analysis for basic income implementation since that is one of the purposes of a trial. Nor does it presume to present targets. Some of the benefits are intangible but many can be quantified over time. A few examples of potential benefits that are quantifiable may put these costs into perspective. The figures below are conjectural only but give some idea of possible direct benefits. The NZ Treasury VOSL (Value of Statistical Life) is $3.85 million. While the VOSL is mainly an accounting device, avoiding a handful of unnecessary deaths in the trial area annually would cover a considerable part of the trial costs even at $1 million/life. That is a realistic expectation. Nationally, assume 3/electorate x 71 electorates = 213 deaths (saved from suicide, drugs, traffic, accidents, and other causes), say $200 million. The Ministry of Health average hospital inpatient DRG (Diagnosis Related Group) provision is about $5000/inpatient stay. Reduced hospital admissions can save a lot of money in the health sector. Reducing inpatient admissions by a handful each week could save more than a million dollars each year. Nationally $1m x 71 electorates is $70 million Savings in the on-going out-patient costs of childhood disease, obesity and mental health can save millions more. With poverty reduced through the elimination of the poverty trap the savings will be very large. Nationally, the savings might be 5 x the hospital savings, say $350 million Past basic income trials show a large reduction in crime. It costs about $100,000/year to keep someone in prison in New Zealand and the average cost of convictions for minor offences is around $20,000. Keeping 10 people out of prison annually and reducing the number of minor convictions by 50 saves around $2 million each year. Nationally $2 million x 71 electorates, say $140 million The cost of accidents in New Zealand is prohibitive. The average cost per claim is more than $2000 and there are nearly 2 million new claims each year. There are 71 general electorates. That’s 28000 accidents in each electorate on average. It is reasonable to assume that better health and well-being and higher self-esteem will help reduce the accident rate, especially vehicle accidents. 1000 (4%) fewer accidents saves $2 million. Nationally $2 million x 71 electorates, say $140 million. Past trials have shown large improvements in labour productivity (up to 25%). Even a 0.1% annual increase in productivity would amount to about $3.6 million in the trial area. Little, if anything is known about ongoing effects of basic income on productivity but there will be some, if only because people will become better skilled as time passes. Nationally $3.6 million x 71 electorates = $250m There are substantial administrative savings, though not at the trial level. Once the income neutral basic income is introduced nationwide a substantial part of the Ministry of Social Development can be dismantled. There would still be an audit unit to monitor household composition and residual functions such as accommodation supplements and special needs as well as its residual child, youth and family functions. Nationally an annual saving of at least one third of the current Social development Budget or around $300 million might not be unreasonable. It may also be possible to directly measure the value of new business start-ups and employment gains. The total direct savings and benefits are likely to be in excess of $1.5 billion/year before taking the vast array of social economic, and environmental benefits into account that add to Human Capital. The main benefit from the trial is likely to be an improvement in the level of caring, community participation and creativity of the people in the trial area. Such psychological and social responses may be qualitative as much as quantitative but they are very real and can also be measured 4 . SUBMISSION 7. That to enhance New Zealand’s financial capital, public money be spent into circulation to repay Crown debt as it falls due and to fund new government capital expenditure. SUBMISSION 8. That the tax saving ($3.4 billion/year) from the retirement of Crown debt be used to fund an “add-on” Best Start programme of $60/week for all those from conception to age 18 not already receiving it . (see also submission 6) Explanation: The use of public money in lieu of existing Crown debt eliminates the cost of interest on existing borrowed bank money. According to the 2017 Budget the funding cost of Crown debt is $3.4 billion. Retiring Crown debt over time will reduce government expenditure annually by up to $3.4 billion. While I appreciate that the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system falls outside the scope of the TWG, the use of existing tax saved does not. The additional cost of extending Best Start (over and above the existing $290 million Best Start commitment) from conception to age 18 at $60/week (before future indexation) is 1100000 (children under 18, 2017) x $60 (weekly payment) x 52(weeks) or $3.4 billion/year. Not only is there an impressive benefit to the financial capital, the payment of Best Start from conception through to age 18 will ensure the Government rapidly exceeds its child poverty reduction target which is a major benefit to New Zealand’s human capital. There is no impact on private bank lending capacity and no cost to government though there is evidently a corresponding reduction in bank profit. Most Crown debt is offshore debt which is cancelled out of existence as the debt is progressively repaid. 4 See, for example, https://psychagainstausterity.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/paa-briefing-paper.pdf I appreciate that the domestic banks need to make reasonable profits if they are to expand lending to the private sector for its purchase of the use of private bank money. The banks might seek to compensate for the loss in domestic profit in part by increasing their bank spread by a small amount (subject to regulatory supervision). Domestic crown debt is relatively small so the change in the banks’ spread (the difference between what they pay depositors and the gross interest they charge could increase by a proportionately small amount. Moreover, the margin could be offset by reducing the OCR by a similar percentage. SUBMISSION 9. That, to improve New Zealand’s physical capital and provide effective competition to the private banking sector, new Government capital expenditure will be funded through RBNZ (subject to available human and material resource limitations) SUBMISSION 10. That the public money made available under Submissions 7 and 9 will be backed by low interest or zero-interest perpetual bonds issued by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). Explanation: A strong case can be made to improve physical capital by funding ongoing government capital expenditure using public money. Budget 2017 estimates capital expenditure at $10.08 billion. Funding through RBNZ at net zero interest saves taxpayers (to the extent capital expenditure is presently funded from taxation) an amount up to $10.08 billion/year that can either be redirected to fund a basic income for adults as set out in Submissions 14 to 17. 3.7% of GDP is typically within the range of nominal GDP growth so it is fiscally and economically responsible to use public money to this extent as long as the lending capacity of the private banking system is monitored and, where necessary, restricted by the application of supplementary capital adequacy ratios. The ability of the Government and RBNZ to do this was recognised at least as far back as the 1956 Royal Commission report. What, if any, compensation is made available to the banking system for its reduced rate of bank money creation (and consequential loss of profit) is a matter of policy. I propose only that the use of public money in this fashion will go some way toward correcting the vast imbalance in the money power that has developed between the private and public sectors through the enclosure (privatisation) of money. SUBMISSION 11. That to restore and improve New Zealand’s natural capital, producers will progressively pay the full cost of the externalities they create through the introduction of pollution taxes (which may include a carbon tax in lieu of the existing ETS or incorporated alongside the ETS). SUBMISSION 12. That pollution taxes may be negative (as in the cases of forest planting and other carbon sinks) and could be based on the NZ Unit (1 metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent) SUBMISSION 13. That the pollution taxes will be offset by an across the board reduction in personal taxation. Explanation: If New Zealand’s natural resources are not to be further degraded through “externalities” the quantum of those externalities will need to be established and their cost fairly distributed among those that create them. As a general concept I propose applying the “polluter pays” principle in its broadest sense. I understand this is an extremely complex area for TWG to consider but I submit it does lie at the heart of tax fairness and equity issues. Producers will tend to pass on the pollution taxes to consumers so that there is an incentive both for producers to reduce pollution (and hence their product prices) and for consumers to consider reducing consumption of those products in response to the price signals. There will be debate about the equivalence among different pollutants but it is one that must be faced to give coherence to the concept of natural capital. It may be that the equivalence is initially a multiple of the NZU price (spot price currently around $21) for the time being (2023 futures at around $25), but the pollutant price schedule would need to be stable over a long enough term to provide market certainty. There have been some reports that repairing dairy pollution alone could be cost$15billion(https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/agribusinessadd/68124994 /nzs-dairy-pollution-cost-may-be-15b-report while air annual air pollution costs may exceed $4 billion http://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-media/media/updated-report- about-impacts-air-pollution-released. They are but 2 of many forms of pollution. Remediating existing pollution and waste issues and maintaining the environment into the future creates a whole new sector of the economy that can provide jobs for those displaced by automation. Applying polluter pays (greenhouse gasses only) to agricultural export products has represented a challenge due to concerns that pollution taxes would substantially increase prices. In respect of diary, assuming 2kg of CO2 emission/kg of product (purely for illustration) the price impact on a tonne of diary product would be about 2 tonne x$21(NZU price) or $42/tonne. At current average market prices around NZ$5000/tonne the potential price increase would be 42/5000 which is less than 1%, well below the variations in fortnightly global diary auction prices so that the actual impact of the ETS on dairy may be somewhat exaggerated. On the other hand, meat production has a larger emissions footprint and consideration may need to be given to how the cost of meat emissions is to be shared if meat exports are to continue into the future. SUBMISSION 14. That social capital be enhanced by progressively implementing a basic income for adults between 18 and 65 years of age. SUBMISSION 15. That the basic income will start at $60/week. SUBMISSION 16. That the basic income be indexed to nominal GDP growth or higher, say 5%. SUBMISSION 17. That the basic income be funded from the savings ($10.08 billion/year) resulting from Submissions 9 and 10. Explanation: There are presently about 3,050,000 adults between 18 and 65. A basic income of $60/week requires funding of 3.05 million people x $60/week x 52 weeks or $9.5 billion/year. This is currently 3.5% of GDP and less than nominal GDP growth. There is $10 billion/year tax revenue made available by using public credit for Government capital investment as set out in Submissions 9 and 10. Assuming an average of 2% inflation and 2% GDP growth, average nominal GDP growth over time would be 4%. Suppose the basic income is indexed at 5%. Indexation at the end of the first year is 5% x $9.5 billion or $480 million, which is less than the amount available ($10 billion less $9.5 billion). After 10 years the basic income will have grown from $60/week to $98/week and the annual indexation will be $784 million. By then the government capital expenditure will also have increased (perhaps by a similar proportion to, say $10billion x 1.05^10(1.63) or $16.3 billion allowing the basic income to be increased beyond $98/week before taking account of population growth if that is what the public desires. Indexation also needs to be applied to the income neutral basic income, to the basic income for children and for the basic income for superannuatants, so, in effect, the whole population. The total value of the basic income is around $60 billion in year 1, (to be confirmed by further analysis) so 5% indexation is $3 billion/year. Much of that can be funded from the savings from the introduction of the basic income (submissions 6,14,15,17) but there may be a shortfall for indexation, especially in the early years. The additional national tax increase from 4% growth is 4% x $270 billion GDP x 33% tax, or $3.6 billion some of which may need to be applied to the basic income indexation. There are many options depending on public opinion. The options range from reducing the indexation for a year or two to temporarily raising taxes from 33% to about 34%. The adult basic income can be funded without tax increases of any kind. Any concerns about inflation can be addressed by staging the introduction to ensure productive capacity matches consumption capacity. Aside from the obvious Keynesian economic expansion the basic income will generate there are all the emancipatory benefits from basic income referred to by Guy Standing. I can supply a wide range of evidence from basic income trials already completed around the world in support of those and other direct benefits such as those referred to in Submission 6. SUBMISSION 18. That the minimum wage be progressively increased up to and beyond the Living Wage to ensure the integrity of the basic income is not undermined by regressive wage and employment conditions. Explanation: The minimum wage needs to keep ahead of the basic income to ensure there is a positive incentive to work. There are about 350,000 state sector employees. For the sake of this submission increases in the minimum wage are assumed to promulgate through the whole sector. If the minimum wage is indexed at 5% the increase is 5% x $16.5 x 350,000 x 40 hours/week x 52 weeks/year or $600 million/year. This is assumed to be funded from natural tax growth so that it does not require changes to tax rates. 7. HOUSING SUBMISSION 19. That Kiwisaver Cash and Default funds be government guaranteed and used to help fund social housing (subject to human and material resource constraints). Explanation: These funds are predominantly concentrated in low risk low return deposits. I submit that (in the absence of using further public credit) the government matches the returns on these funds and uses them to fund social housing. According to the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) annual report for the year ended 31 March 2017 there were $5.1 billion invested in such accounts. If 75% ($3.8 billion) of that passive money were invested into social housing it would make a worthwhile contribution to New Zealand’s social housing needs. The return on those funds (at, say, around 4% net of tax, or $150 million) would need to be taxpayer funded from existing revenue. SUBMISSION 20. That first home buyers be granted a deposit on their first home if they move to a provincial or rural area within accommodation supplement areas 3 and 4 and take up a permanent job there. Explanation: House prices in New Zealand are not strictly determined by supply and demand. That is why they have responded rather poorly to changes in government and RBNZ policy settings. House prices are dependent on what the banks will lend to their customers. That’s why aggregate house price increases have very closely followed the increase in the broad money supply in recent decades. Relative prices between one area and another are reflected by supply and demand but not the aggregate. Those who bought houses just a few years ago for $400000 who now see their homes worth $600000 automatically have a $200000 equity. They are able to trade up to a million-dollar home because they have (under current policy) the 20% deposit needed to purchase the more expensive property. That means the LVR ratio has had the perverse outcome of preventing new prospective home owners from gaining home ownership. That is one major reason why the rate of increase in domestic credit has fallen over the past several years compared with previous years. As banks have funded ever higher house prices (because they consider their lending safe with the 20% deposit requirement together with their assessment of their customers’ ability to fund the property at market interest rates) housing affordability has declined. There are no longer as many creditworthy buyers in major price centres like Auckland where prices have approached saturation point. Overall, however, aggregate prices nationwide are still rising albeit at a somewhat slower rate as reflected in domestic credit growth. Slowing immigration may be accentuating the effect too. RBNZ has recently floated the prospect of using of mandated LIR (Loan to income ratios). That would potentially have a larger effect on home ownership than the LVR but would again disproportionately affect those attempting to buy their first home. On 7 November 2016, the previous government announced it would spend $300m on 1,400 “emergency housing” beds over four years of which only 600 were earmarked for Auckland. This was, I submit, an inefficient and ineffective short-term response to the housing crisis when a better alternative might be available that could help reduce the need for “emergency housing” beds. Submission 19 would grant eligible families a lump sum deposit, identical for all applicants and sufficient to purchase a home priced up to, say, $350,000 in accommodation supplement (AS) areas 3 and 4. Those areas can be found listed at https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/newsroom/2017/budget- 2017.html Low income families renting in Areas 1 and 2, who receive the maximum accommodation supplement, will be keen as the goal of home ownership is still very strong. Recent Government proposals to tighten visa rules for immigrant labour mean that permanent jobs may be available in rural areas for those who choose to relocate and (re)train under this proposal. A fixed grant would encourage such families to buy homes that cost less than $350,000 because it gives them more equity in their home. If the government also offers a loan guarantee for a specified term, the banks could perhaps be persuaded (or permitted) to lend on a ten per cent deposit. The grant to each family would then be $35000. Affordable new housing can still be built in AS area 4 (and probably in some parts of AS area 3) for under $350,000 making the proposal sustainable in the long-term. New housing construction would be limited by resource constraints so the proposal would need to be progressively implemented over several years. There are thousands of homes for sale in AS areas 3 and 4 some of which could be suitable for relocated households. By way of example, rehousing 10,000 families requiring a 10 per cent deposit for a home ($35,000 for each family), would result in a notional one-off cost of $350 million. This compares very favourably to the estimated $300 million needed to provide just 1400 “emergency housing” beds over four years as announced by the previous Government in late 2016. Ten thousand families means up to 30,000 people can be relocated, making the proposal nearly 20 times more economically efficient than the provision of 1400 beds in Auckland. To ensure that families who agree to move can meet interest payments over the short term, the proposal could also provide for existing AS payments be continued for several years. This incurs no additional fiscal cost as the government is already paying such families the maximum accommodation supplement. The cost of the proposal is mitigated by savings in future infrastructure and building costs as well as social costs in Auckland and elsewhere. Resettling just 10,000 families will lessen the demand for rental accommodation in Auckland and likely have a substantial impact on rental costs there. It will also have a profound, positive effect on the lives of the families who relocate as well as simplifying the implementation of basic income in the future. I have not attempted to quantify the benefits but they will be very large indeed, exceeding the relocation costs many times over. 8. THE FIVE KEY QUESTIONS What does the future of tax look like to you? The tax system will need to evolve to meet the future. Ways will need to be found to give value and coherence to the Living Standards Framework. Our submissions 5-20 go some considerable way to achieving that but they do mean letting go preconceived tax and economic dogma to enable TWG members to consider them on their merits. Except for Submission 3 and possibly Submissions 16 and 18 the submissions keep strictly to the Terms of Reference in that there is little no change to the total tax. In the longer run, the tax system as it is now could, in its current form, become redundant. With a full public money system (where the banks act as Savings and Loan intermediaries and do not create bank money for profit) all government expenditure would be funded by public money provided through the reserve bank. The excess would be continuously taxed back and cancelled by applying a single Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) on all payments from bank accounts as proposed in a limited form in Submission 5. The beauty of the FTT is that it is extremely easy to administer, costs very little, and is 100% progressive across the whole of the productive and investment sectors of the economy. On 2017 budget figures and taking into account these submissions the FTT (including that in Submission 5) would be in the vicinity of 17.5%, not all that much more than GST is now. What is the purpose of tax? The purpose of tax is to fund government. Our submissions fit very well with the detailed questions set out in the TWG video clip. They seek to improve simplicity, create transformational changes by applying the Living Standards Framework and will dramatically and positively influence behaviour. Are we taxing the right things? I have not specifically addressed issues relating to charities and companies located in overseas jurisdictions in the submissions. Nor have I considered the issue of Trusts or the myriad tax avoidance schemes that do weigh heavily on New Zealand’s tax revenue and do need to be addressed. I submit that in an ideal world of the future there would be no tax exemptions and no need for Trusts. I did consider including in our submissions a Financial Transactions Surcharge (FTS) on all offshore payments, possibly in addition to the Financial Transactions Tax I have considered. All transactions initiated in New Zealand would have to be completed in New Zealand to avoid “bundling” and netting out of transactions offshore. An FTS would have as a main objective the correction of New Zealand’s persistent current account deficit and the corresponding stabilisation of New Zealand’s exchange rate. Another great advantage would be that for the first time those spending money offshore (for air travel and the importation of luxury goods, for example) would pay the true cost of that expenditure. At the moment those businesses and individuals are being subsidised in various ways by those who spend all their money locally. The revenue raised by the FTS would be used to offset domestic taxes to ensure it remains tax neutral. Can tax make housing more affordable? I have addressed this matter at some length in our submissions 18 and 19 under Section 7 Housing. I submit there is no such thing as affordable housing. We can make houses smaller, we can make them of lesser quality, we can perhaps reduce compliance costs though that last may be difficult given recent issues in the construction industry. We can encourage new technology such as 3-D printing of houses, though that is not as simple as in other parts of the world either given our earthquake codes. We can use modular designs and prefabrication but they have been available for decades and made little commercial progress in New Zealand. Nor can land prices be reduced without causing serious issues in New Zealand’s investment sector. The best we can do is, by managing the banking system, providing social housing, and ethically reducing population growth (in part through lower immigration) to reduce future increases in land prices. We can, however, reduce rental pressures, both by proposals like Submission 19 and especially by switching from electronic bank cash to electronic public cash as discussed in the submissions. Public money properly administered in the public interest will enable investment interest rates to fall to as little as 2-3% while at the same time stabilising inflation below 1%. With the money supply and inflation properly managed, the rate of return on rental housing would fall to 3% or below, reversing over time the serious imbalance between incomes and rental expectations What tax issues matter most to you? The most important single tax related issue is the implementation over time of a basic income that is sufficient to meet basic needs and participate in society. It can be built to a level higher than the current living wage (for various households) eliminating poverty for everyone. (We would also expect the Living Wage itself to increase beyond its current level in real terms). Capital gains tax is covered under the Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) submissions. Issues surrounding fair taxation of automation are also dealt with in part by the FTT. Under the proposals embodied in these submissions, automation should be welcomed with open arms. Not only does it provide the possibility of enhanced free time, it will free up the human capital we will need to build a society based on the core values incorporated in care, community and creativity. 30 April 2018 Commented \[M1\]:

Tax Working Group Submission Name: Moki Raroa Address: Email: Phone: Group: CAYAD Coordinator, Te Aroha Kanarahi Trust, Hicks Bay I do not wish to come and speak to my submission Background I am a CAYAD (Community Action Youth and Drugs) working with the youth and their whanau in Hicks Bay and the wider Matakaoaa area. I see the impact of alcohol and the behaviours that come with alcohol misuse on a daily basis and work towards minimising the impact and support the pathways for whanau to achieve wellbeing Hicks Bay is a very isolated community consisting of a general store, Kura Kaupapa Maori and a Motel. It is also part of the Matakaoa community which consists of 3 villages, Potaka(School and Motel) te Araroa(Motor Camp, School, General Store, Cafe, RSA and licenced cafe) and Hicks Bay There are 8 liquor outlets in this area with the 2 Rugby Cubs getting licences for the season bringing the total to 10 for the area which is over 80% Maori being a Decile 10 on the Deprivation Scale(most deprived socio-economically) There is only a population of 1600 in this area. Submission We support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. We believe that the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand is not fair for the majority of New Zealanders. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol- related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to addressed • Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been • New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. • Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). • People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, we recommend the following: • Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% • Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) • Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. • It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, we recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the fairest as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups.

Future of Tax – submission 29 April 2018 Orlando Robbins – MBA, BSc, CEng, MIE Prioritisation of government spending relative to tax income For years politicians have used the tax system for left or right wing political gain purposes. The left wing usually increasing benefits and the number that qualify for free (state) money and the right for reducing taxes and in some equal measure reducing some services and the amount of free money available. Fundamentally though any government needs a vibrant and growing economy to be able to generate incomes that can be taxed and provide excellent services to its citizens Maintaining current tax levels and economic growth with increasing GDP actually increases government tax income. Increasing taxes reduces motives for work and for inward investment thus reducing the GDP and essentially maintaining a same level of income while making people poorer and eating up more of the pot in additional unemployment costs In order to improve the effects of the wealth gap that exists in any economy one should look at effect on quality of life and look at bringing a better balance to that Comment on spending • In New Zealand despite having one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world we spend fully 33% of the government’s budget on social welfare. A good part of the spending goes on working for families and similar financial aid packages for working families whose income is deemed too low. This has effectively been subsidising employers for more than 15 years since its inception – but comes from the left wing of political thinking of creating dependant voters. Instead the right thing to do would have been at the time, and since is to force employers to actually pay a sensible wage or an additional employment cost similar to ACC or other compulsory charges, rather than \[1\] substituting taxpayer money. The simplest new tax you can introduce is one on employers that is a compulsory cost before profits based on their employee payment profile – the lower the average hourly rate the higher the employer’s employee contribution is which would fund the working for families. This is already workable from the existing PAYE documentation and is simple data analysis and invoicing – and can be monthly. This alone would be a fairly targeted tax aimed at reducing the wealth gap and improving quality of life for all. • Student loans and funding. The tertiary education system has a poor and inefficient funding model – many institutions work on bums on seats mentality and the quality aspect of teaching goes out the window. Many institutions take a full fee even after the student has dropped out having a negative effect on the person and creating inefficiencies in the system. Throwing money at education does not work this has been demonstrated time and again and shows in New Zealand self-deluded methods of calculating successful outcomes with devalued qualifications. Looking at ways of improving the outcomes for students into meaningful employment is the key – in other countries educational institutions have to follow through on their teaching by ensuring graduates are employed within three months of graduating – they have to have a job finding and placing facility – a target of 90% success is a normal target. Change the way these institutions are funded Change the way student loans are allocated – reduce the amount of the loan available – in other words lower fees to tie in with changing the institution funding model - but allow a real level of accommodation and living expense allowance for free, based on student performance at the institution – measurable and merit based but effective. This will have the effect of having a much higher graduation ration but students leaving institutions with much lower debt levels – immediately allowing the to achieve better quality of life outcomes rather than paying off massive debts for the most productive time of their lives. • Taxation levels – this is always a thorny issue – what is fair? After all hard work at becoming a specialist on one’s field and working hard should not be penalised with higher taxes than for people who do not do that – but there are medians that need to apply for systems to function Taxable income Tax on this income Effective tax rate $0 - $10,000 Nil 0% $10,001 - $35,000 19c for each dollar over $10,000 0% to 13.57% $35,001 – $60,000 $4750 + 25c for each dollar over $35,000 13.57% to 18.33% $60,001 - $90,000 $11000 + 31c for each dollar over $60,000 18.33% to 22.56% $90,001 - $180,000 $20300 + 36c for each dollar over $90,000 22.56% to 29.28% Above $180,000 $52700 + 39c for each dollar over $180,000 29.28% to 39% The above would result in an overall higher tax income for the government but still be relatively fair to most ordinary Kiwis. The real benefit comes from the people below an income of $35,000 benefitting much more with dramatically lowered taxes, whilst the middle-income earners largely standing still with curve stretching out to $90,000 from $70,000 but being more than made up for by the 36c and 39c rates above these. The fundamental benefit is a lower level of government subsidy for the lowest earners but with a slightly higher tax income overall – whilst still maintaining New Zealand as a competitive labour market. Essentially the above steps would fundamentally reduce the need for safety net type of spending whilst maintaining the same levels of tax income – freeing up the excess several billion to be spent on more healthcare, public defence, fighting the drug war threatening to break society and on genuine environmental improvement options. Some fundamental truths about the effects of taxation: • Raising tax on a product or service has never in the history of taxation reduced its price – it has always increased its price • Raising the price of a product or service has a tendency to reduce the demand for it – e.g cigarettes • Reducing the demand for a product or service through artificial methods of price increase such as taxation does not work so well when it comes to absolutely must have necessities such as housing and fuel – it results in homelessness and reducing travel and increased product prices. One cannot argue for the sake of convenience that increasing taxes will create a larger tax income while simultaneously arguing that increasing taxes will successfully reduce demand – these are not mutually exclusive effects. For example: • Putting tax on petrol will cause a reduction in the volume by 4% to 5% of petrol bought - this will cause a net reduction or at best no change in the overall duties received not an increase. This is because a rather large chunk of the petrol price is tax – but the worse side effect is a reduction of economic activity coupled with an accompanying increase in the cost of goods and services – a double negative whammy for no real change in tax income • Creating a capital gains tax where it does not exist has several effects. o Firstly, the CGT on property is designed to raise taxes for the sake of increasing tax income – no other reason o However, the argument being used to justify it is that it will reduce house prices by reducing house trader activity and therefore leave a bigger pool of houses for people to buy. o This whole argument pre-supposes there is a balanced supply/demand equation at work and the reduction in demand from investors will leave excess supply which will lead to lowering of prices and more opportunities for home buyers to acquire. The problem with this logic is: ▪ 35% of properties listed are investors selling to upgrade – this level of listings would reduce dramatically so the supply would decrease ▪ 35% of new houses built are built by investors – this would also reduce thus reducing stocks further ▪ The stock levels between supply and demand are already not in balance – there is currently a shortage of stock which would be exacerbated by a CGT ▪ House prices would increase. In order to make up for the loss of a portion of the capital gain to taxes the investors would look to increase the selling price of the houses in compensation. This means rent increases by a suitable percentage to make the investment equation work – this would occur naturally due to the initial shortage the CGT will create o It has been demonstrated in every jurisdiction that capital gains taxes is not effective at changing investment habits – typically it flattens for a year and then carries on catching up with where it should have been without it over the next three years. It is not effective at creating lower priced more affordable houses – if anything it has the opposite effect for would be renters trying to save for a deposit by increasing rents o It is a myth that rents only increase at the rate of wage inflation – when a major re-alignment occurs in all business costs these are passed on – there is no competition. This has been proven by the 40% rent increases of the last four to five years relative to an overall 10% to 15% wage rise – it is the same as increasing the OCR, universally applied. • Personal tax rates - Making misleading claims in the Submission background notes around the higher tax rates. Figure 7 on page 28 tries to paint a picture that the top tax rate on personal income is much lower that in many other countries. But the level at which the top rate is charged in New Zealand is almost the lowest in the world – in Australia for instance its 45%, but this applies to taxable incomes above $180,000 with the effective rate being 30% for amounts below this level and dropping. See table Taxable income Tax on this income Effective tax rate $1 – $18,200 Nil 0% $18,201 – $37,000 19c for each $1 over $18,200 0 – 9.65% $37,001 – $87,000 $3,572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37,000 9.65 – 22.78% $87,001 – $180,000 $19,822 plus 37c for each $1 over $87,000 22.78 – 30.13% $180,001 and over $54,232 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000 30.13 – less than 45% New Zealand also has the fifth highest tax on personal income as percentage of GDP – this is as a result of the average wage being almost at the level where the highest tax rates kick in There is nothing like increasing taxes in order to reduce investments both personal and economy growing. Why would any business think of increasing investments if the returns, both personal and business are going to be penalised more – the sensible big and medium money investors will invest offshore as will the pension funds Taxation and its purpose The purpose of a taxation system is to raise funds in order for the state to provide governance and other services. The typical services a modern western socially responsible state would provide includes: • National defence system and services • Legal system – Courts Prosecution service Public defence service Police force Prison system • Financial and commerce regulation systems and services • Health care system and services - Hospitals Emergency and ambulance GP and community health care • Education system and Services - Primary Secondary Tertiary • Infrastructure management and development – Energy Roads Rail Ports Environment • Social welfare system and services – Benefit system Pensions Poverty eradication Social housing • Fire fighting and rescue services • Secondary Services – Heritage, Culture and recreation

Submission to the Tax Working Group From: Peter Lewis, Residential Landlord Vice-President, Auckland Property Investors Association Board Member, NZ Property Investors Federation Taxation and Residential Investment Property: There is much confusion, both in the public mind and the political sphere, between the role of a property speculator and that of a property investor. Many commentators use the terms interchangeably and without distinction, attacking all property people as speculators who they then blame for many of the ills of society. Landlords are seldom speculators. People who run bookshops do not buy and sell their shops. Similarly, Landlords seldom trade in property. What Landlords do is rent out accommodation. If they do ever sell, they obviously cannot run their accommodation business. Those people who do trade in property are traders, developers or renovators - not landlords, and are taxed on an entirely different basis. I have been a landlord since 1992, and over that 26 years I have never sold an investment property. Landlords seek to make a profit by renting out a property. Their income is the rent they charge, and like any other business they can then legally deduct the costs involved in running their business before paying tax on that net income. There are frequent demands for the tax loopholes that landlords enjoy to be removed. This never happens - for the simple reason that there aren’t any. Back in 2007, at a Parliamentary Select Committee hearing, Deputy IRD Commissioner Robin Oliver was asked why people had the impression that there was some tax advantage in investments in rental housing. His reply was blunt: "The short answer is there are none." Yet this myth remains popular and is frequently quoted by those who should know better. I personally have paid tax every year on the income I derive from my rental properties. Public perception is that residential landlords are wealthy individuals who dress like the Monopoly Man and drive around in expensive limousines. Wrong. Over 90% of NZ landlords own just one or two rental properties. Thus when people attack and condemn landlords they are not attacking Google or Apple, they are actually criticising their next door neighbour, their plumber or their local school teacher. The man on the top of the mountain did not fall there. Hardly any of today’s Landlords woke up one morning to find – surprise surprise - that they had got a rental or two overnight without any effort. Acquiring an investment property and then renting it out is, for those of us who don’t win Lotto, a long hard self-sacrificing slog. Landlords, generally speaking, are hardworking, thrifty and goal orientated. These are people that any sane society should cherish and reward, not vilify and punish. \[1\] Most tenants have never owned property. They firmly believe that the rent they pay goes entirely into the Landlords pocket and then is spent on overseas trips and flash cars. However, when you do own your own home, you then appreciate that the price of the house is actually only the down payment. Even without any mortgage burden the constant stream of bills for rates, insurance, water, and household services add up to a substantial and unavoidable sum each and every year. All of these costs also add to the tax take by virtue of the GST added to each and every item. Every Government action creates two after-effects. Costs go up and people alter their behaviour to avoid or minimise the effects of that action. Already, the recent demands put upon rental housing has removed from the market those many houses rented out by owner- occupiers who are off overseas for just a year or two. The expense of making the house compliant now exceed the return. Overtime, if the current trends continue, more and more landlords will sell up and retire. Any tax imposition on and restricted to residential rentals alone will only serve to reinforce this trend. Bias Against Residential Property Investors: From the briefing papers supplied, would appear that the researchers have an agenda against rental property. This was the case with the last TWG in 2010 which claimed that rental property took $200m a year out of the tax take when this had only happened once, due to high mortgage interest rates, over a 27 year period. It will surprise many to learn that according to the latest IRD data, rental property owners have paid tax on rental property income of between $1.3 and $1.5 billion dollars in each of the five years to 2016. In their background paper "Future of Tax" the TWG say that "property remains under taxed compared to other investments. For instance, any profits from the sale of a long term property investment generally isn't taxed." This is misleading as the IRD has confirmed that similar profits from the sale of shares, farms, businesses and other assets that grow in value are also untaxed. We have had a number high-profile sales of New Zealand companies (such as TradeMe, Icebreaker and 42 Below) to overseas investors with their founders being rewarded to the tune of many millions of dollars. These pay-outs, which massively dwarf any profits that could possibly be made from the sale of a residential investment property, are also entirely tax-free under the current law. Of most importance is that the TWG uses a study into Marginal Effective Tax Rates (METR) on savings to claim that "Owner occupied and rental housing is undertaxed relative to other assets." However a just released report by Morgan Wallace, a financial economics consultancy, has uncovered serious flaws with the TWG's study, leading them to conclude that apart from bank deposits, rental property is actually taxed at a higher rate than other asset classes. A key flaw in the TWG study is that they assume capital growth for property but not for other capital growth assets. They treat PIE Funds, superannuation and companies like bank deposits, not only assuming they don't increase in value, but that they actually lose value due to the effects of inflation. Morgan Wallace state that "the TWG paper cannot therefore be accepted at face value. If a capital return component were to be included for PIE, superannuation and company investments, then all three would have lower METR than presented in the TWG research paper." The TWG also didn't include a key asset class, being direct share investments. Morgan Wallace said that "If this asset class were to be included, it would also have a lower METR than rental property under the TWG Paper framework." Capital Taxes: Taxing capital gains is invariably a complicated and expensive exercise. Before implementing the tax you need firstly to determine the types of assets to be taxed and when it will be payable. What real property and when? How about shares, sales of businesses, kiwisaver portfolios, collectable art items, vintage cars? All these hair-splitting decisions would require considerable thought and negotiation, much legal and accounting argument on both sides, and an incredibly complex rulebook. The likelihood then is that such a tax would be restricted to real property, and with the required exemption of the owner-occupied family home, it would become a punitive tax rather than a means of raising considerable revenue. Such a restricted CGT would never be more than a tiny fraction of total tax receipts and also tend to restrain the movement of both assets and capital around the economy. Many people have promoted the idea of a CGT as a way of controlling housing costs. Quite why they would expect that putting a tax on something would reduce its price they have always failed to explain. This argument also fails when you consider the rampant housing market in cities such as Sydney, London and San Francisco – all located in countries where a CGT is imposed. Where a CGT exists but owner-occupied homes have been exempt, housing prices have risen rapidly as people have responded by spending the money they would previously have invested elsewhere on renovating and improving their own homes, secure in the knowledge that when they do sell that particular asset there will be no tax to pay. Obvious Income Tax Avoidance: There are however some taxpayers who currently appear to be paying less tax than other similar entities for purely historical reasons. These companies compete commercially with other, less tax-favoured entities and thus enjoy an unearned advantage. Companies owned by charities and Maori Authorities have a tax advantage over their competitors which the Tax Working Group should recommend be closed. Under the current law companies owned by registered charities are liable to pay zero income tax, even if only a portion (or none) of their income is distributed to the parent charity and the business’ activity has no connection to the charitable purpose. How to Collect a Tax on Capital Transactions: Many of the tax change suggestions being made are designed to close real or perceived loopholes or minimize avoidance, typically by adjusting or extending the existing system. But there is an idea for something new: a very small tax on monetary flows, also known as a Financial Transactions Tax. Because the daily flow of money through the banking system is so vast - many millions of dollars every day—a tiny FTT, say, just a few hundredths of a percent, could raise significant money for the Government. Because the FTT would be carried out within the existing banking system, once set up this would require minimal ongoing overhead. Thus a FTT fulfils the requirements for a highly efficient tax collection system: - it would be broad-based - it would be neutral, affecting all taxpayers equally - it would be convenient and difficult to avoid - it would be simple to understand - it would be economic to collect. This FTT would also capture the sale and purchase of capital assets without the high associated administrative cost of valuing each and every transaction in a similar way that the existing GST impacts on the sale of goods and services. If a property or other asset is sold, the money is banked and the FTT is collected. If a property or other asset is bought the money moves from the purchasers account and FTT collected. Easily implemented, easily collected and the tax on each individual transaction would be so minor that it would probably not even be noticed by the taxpayer. As an additional benefit, such a transaction tax would also capture monetary flows to international entities that currently largely escape the NZ tax system, such as Google, Facebook and other internet-based traders. Summary: Current proposals to shift a substantial part of the tax burden on to capital holdings would be controversial, complicated, and carry high compliance costs. Politically, such taxes would require substantial parts of the economy to be exempt (e.g. owner-occupied housing). Existing historic exemptions should be removed. A Financial Transactions Tax should be introduced that collects from all monetary flows around the banking system as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to Capital Gains or Wealth taxes. I would welcome the opportunity to appear in person to be heard before the group to discuss my proposals. You may contact me to discuss. Peter Lewis. \[1\]

Submission to the 2018 Tax Working Group Peter Rankin 30 April 2018 Su mmary The TWG is tasked with recommending improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of our tax system and preparing it for a changing future. In doing so it will want to follow the rules of good tax design – keep tax simple, broad-based and low rate. Previous tax reviews have commonly pointed to the notable gap in New Zealand’s tax system – the absence of tax on wealth. Filling that gap with a well-designed, simple, broad-based, low rate tax would meet the TWG’s mandate. The best way to do that would be to introduce a tax on all wealth at a low rate – say 0.5%. This would: • greatly improve vertical and horizontal fairness; • improve balance across the sectors of income generation and investment, and • substantially broaden the tax base protecting it against challenges from changing demography and labour markets. I would be happy to discuss this submission. Discussion Historically New Zealand’s central government has taxed income, not capital. Where we have drifted towards taxing capital, we have done it by redefining income e.g.: determining that if an entity is in the business of trading capital items, the profits derived from that activity will be defined as ‘income’ and liable for tax. Accordingly a lot of the work of accountants and tax lawyers has gone into detailing distinctions between the two and finding ways to shift income into non-taxable capital gain and maximise deductions from the remaining income. While the cost of this professional activity is counted as an addition to GDP, no benefit accrues to the well-being of New Zealanders. The recent housing bubble has attracted more attention to the gap in our tax system, but the business of structuring enterprises for ‘tax efficiency’ has been gathering steam for decades. It was in the 1980s that one of NZ’s richest men (Bob Jones) commented that for the rich, paying tax was optional – because they always had the option of structuring their affairs to grow their capital and live off it rather than generating current income and paying tax on it. \[1\] This distortion has many serious effects. The most important is that it undermines the perception of ‘fairness’ in New Zealand society. Those that consider themselves less than wealthy will look for their own ways to compensate for the unfairness. Trust in society is eroded, with consequences for efficiency. Unfairness is becoming more obvious. Wealth inequality in New Zealand has increased dramatically even while income inequality has recently remained fairly steady - not surprising when income is taxed and capital gains are tax-free. Houses have been the major focus for Kiwi investment – because they are the easiest way for most Kiwis to access tax-free capital gains and the obvious path to an asset base for retirement. But housing affordability has fallen: fewer young Kiwis can imagine owning their own home, and more therefore depend on the rental market. Because New Zealand has had very high rates of home ownership the rental market has never developed the level of sophistication and fairness that is found in other OECD countries. Reliance on a landlord-biased rental market can be a big factor in deepening the difficulties of young, low-income, solo-parent or blended families. Small, cold, mouldy housing contributes to child sickness, low school attendance and poor school achievement: that has life-long effects for the child, their enjoyment of life – and their ability to contribute to society. Rental insecurity and frequent shifts from one house – and school – to another, exacerbate this. Rates of home ownership are falling. Historically New Zealand’s high rates of home ownership have been a solid bulwark against poverty among the elderly. As that changes, more and more of the elderly will be trying to pay rent out of current levels of superannuation – just as demography puts more pressure on the sustainability of those levels. Unless these trends change, New Zealand will have to deal with poverty at both ends of the age range. Combine that with perceptions of unfairness and the cohesion of society comes under more pressure. The tax system has contributed to the development of these problems and it needs to contribute to their resolution – both in fact and in perception. We need a tax system that is less easily avoided – so that people see that paying tax is fair. And our future needs one that is more balanced across the sectors of the economy – so that investment decisions are not distorted by tax avoidance. To support those aims we need a tax system that sticks to the basic principles of good tax design: simple, broad and low rate. Judged against those criteria: • the ‘bright line test’ would not have significant effects on either tax avoidance or housing affordability; • a stamp duty is a simple, broad, efficient tax but would not make a substantial difference to fairness or balance; and • a financial transactions tax could be a simple, broad-based tax but would be ineffective if New Zealand alone introduced it. That leaves four taxes that could make a significant difference to our tax system: • a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) that taxes realised gains in capital value • a Risk Free Rate of Return (RFRR) tax that taxes imputed income from capital; • a land tax that taxes the value of one class of assets; and • a wealth tax that taxes the value of all classes of assets. CGT and RFRR fit within the New Zealand tradition of broadening the tax base by redefining the distinction between wealth and income. But the inherent calculations and complications (as indicated in Appendix 2 of the TWG Background Paper) take them some distance from the ideal of simplicity: time and money will be spent testing the limits of the new definitions – adding little to GDP or well-being. A Land Tax could meet the criteria better – if it were designed as a low rate tax on ‘unimproved’ value of all land. Any exemptions or variations in rate would allow room for similar waste in attempts to minimise tax liability. But it does not meet the test of balance – it taxes only one form of capital and therefore distorts investment between sectors that rely on land and those that use other forms of capital. A wealth tax could meet all the criteria. A low level (say: 0.5%) on the value of all capital assets at each year’s tax date would substantially broaden the base of the New Zealand tax system. This would provide opportunities to act on many challenges. Base broadening would improve fairness by reducing the avenues for tax avoidance. It would also reduce reliance on taxing labour income at a time when patterns of employment and remuneration are changing. Housing investments would be brought into the system in a simple and comprehensive way. The TWG Background Paper presents no arguments against a wealth tax beyond saying that only a few countries have one. A footnote provides a reference to a useful recent OECD study on ‘The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD’. This notes that fewer countries (four in the OECD) now have wealth taxes but that interest has been increasing because of the rise in wealth inequality. It points to some weaknesses but notes, crucially, that the value of a wealth tax to any particular country cannot be assessed in isolation. It concludes that there are ‘stronger arguments for having a wealth tax in the absence of broad-based personal capital income taxes and taxes on wealth transfers.’ This is precisely the situation in New Zealand. There are strong arguments for giving serious consideration to a simple, broad, low rate wealth tax in New Zealand. Exclusion of the Family Home The terms of reference preclude the TWG from including any form of taxation of the family home in its recommendations. But that will not prevent discussion of the issue. Government decisions on its response to the report will be heavily influenced by a public debate that will continue until election time in 2020. The issue of the family home is an important one; it is not straightforward and there is room for a well-informed debate. The TWG should provide a sound base for that discussion. Excluding the family home will produce distortions to fairness and sensible investment decisions. It will open the way for legal and accounting arguments around definitions, times and boundaries – all of which are wasteful and unfair to those whose incomes preclude their participation in the benefits. And there is a simpler solution to the issue – include all property but with an exemption for the first $x.000 at a level related to the average house value. Then both the vertical and horizontal fairness criteria are met. Balance across the sectors of investment is preserved. And the rules of good tax design are observed: the tax is broad, simple and low rate. The example of GST needs to be followed. NZ raises more than most OECD countries from its GST at a lower rate because it observes those rules. Its terms of reference may preclude the TWG from recommending taxes on the family home: they do not prevent it from raising issues and informing the public debate. Final Word New Zealand needs a better tax system for a changing future. Many tax reviews have pointed the way but failed to follow through. Let this be the Review that at last produces a base for creating a tax system that is fair and efficient – with a simple, broad-based, low rate tax on wealth.

Submission to the Tax Working Group 1 2 secretariat@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 3 4 Submitter: 5 Perry Spiller 6 7 8 9 30 April 2018 10 11 My primary concern with the potential deliberations of the Tax Working 12 Group is the idea of a capital gains tax \[CGT\]. Please appreciate that 13 such a tax is unlikely to have any financial impact on me because I have 14 no assets likely to be ensnared by such a tax, so my stance is not from 15 someone having a vested interest. 16 17 Amongst my concerns is the widespread use - or misuse by ignorance, 18 accident or design - of certain words. 19 20 A second significant concern is that a CGT gives governments an 21 incentive to foster inflation. 22 23 When considering the adverse impact of a CGT, for illustrative purposes 24 in the scenario below, I have used figures I know, relating to my home. 1 25 26 In the context of a CGT, the words I refer to are: 27 28 \* Gain\[s\] \* Value 29 \* Cost \* Inflation 30 \* Purchasing power. \* Price 31 32 On the face of it, the property I live on has achieved a capital gain of 33 seven times its original purchase price, since 1978. If I sold this property 34 for that sevenfold increase in price, and I had truly made a gain in so 35 doing, I should be able to buy seven similar properties with that gain. 36 37 That would be impossible. All other similar properties have changed in 38 price parity by more or less the same factor. So where is the gain? 39 40 1 For the purposes of this submission, I have ignored the proposed exemption for personal dwellings. \[1\] There stark reality is that there was no gain at all - only a change in 41 numbers on Rating Valuation Notices, over the years. 42 43 In removing the deprecation allowance on buildings, former Minister of 44 Finance Bill English averred: " . . . it made no sense to allow 45 depreciation on buildings which appreciate in value." 46 47 Buildings do not appreciate in value. They increase in cost because the 48 price - the number of dollars required to buy them - increases, mainly 49 because of inflation. The price in the number of dollars needed to 50 replace the same building would also increase, for the same reason. 51 52 Those circumstances occur because the purchasing power of the dollars 53 involved has been eroded by time and inflation. 54 55 Value is not the same as cost or price. It is sobering that the Minister of 56 Finance of New Zealand did not know the difference. Or chose to be 57 deceptive or willfully ignorant. 58 59 In the example of selling my home, there would be no capital gain at all. 60 I.e. there would be no 'hidden' income in its sale price. However, if any 61 government implements a CGT and the sale was subject to it, I would be 62 liable for the cost of a tax paid in contemporary-value dollars on that 63 illusory gain. A non-gain that, in reality, is only bigger prices and 64 numbers representing the counterfeit coins of inflation. 65 66 In principle, that scenario would apply to any capital item that is subject 67 to increases in purchasing or replacement costs, due mainly to inflation. 68 69 The few small-scale (mum-and-dad) property investors I've spoken to 70 often mention that inflation is a cardinal factor in their decision to invest 71 in a residential rental property. I.e. they buy rental properties as a hedge 72 against inflation, not as a way on earning un-taxed income. 73 74 If a CGT is selectively proposed on rental properties by the TWG, 75 recommend that be it inflation indexed, (using the Housing Price 76 Index, rather than the Consumer Price Index), to remove the 77 incentive for governments to foster inflation as a way to increase 78 taxation revenue, by stealth. 79

INTRODUCTION Methodism in New Zealand-Foundation On 22 January 1822, the Rev. Samuel Leigh and his wife arrived in New Zealand to begin the Wesleyan Methodist Mission. They had been appointed to mission work in the colony by the Wesleyan Methodist Conference in England, and they thus represented missionary zeal that marked Methodism almost from its inception under John and Charles Wesley. By the late nineteenth century the Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists, Free Methodists, and Bible Christians (all to be joined in 1913 to form the Methodist Church of New Zealand) were meeting in almost 1,000 churches, halls, and houses, and there were over 100,000 people attending the services. Based upon 2013 census data, 3% of those people who reported a religious affiliation indicated they were Methodist. This accounts for just under 103,000 people. The Methodist Church is the 5 th largest Christian based Church within New Zealand. The Methodist Church of New Zealand (the Church) was instrumental in gathering signatories for the Treaty of Waitangi, supporting Maori and developing a bi cultural Church to further meet obligations under the Treaty. The Church has moved from the traditional view of “mission” within the new colony of New Zealand and has broadened its approach as the needs of New Zealanders and society have changed. The focus on social justice is strong within the modern Methodist Church of New Zealand. Vision Statement Te Haahi Weteriana O Aotearoa – The Methodist Church of New Zealand is a Church:  Passionate in its commitment to living out the love and grace of God known in Jesus Christ;  Actively concerned with all life;  Committed to the Treaty of Waitangi and to talking and walking justice. Strategy: To achieve this vision the Church will:  Creatively focus its people, finances and resources in the life and Mission of the Church.  Empower the people to live out the Vision by establishing cost effective: o communication networks; o accessible education opportunities  Constantly evaluate its work against the Vision Statement. SUBMISSION The intention of this submission is not to be a detailed examination of the Background Paper released for public submission nor to answer all the questions posed in the Background Paper, but is to establish a relationship between the Church and the Tax Working Group. The Church would like to continue to engage with the Tax Working Group while the Tax Working Group further refines its views into a detailed working document ready for implementation. The Church is also a member of the InterChurch Bureau of New Zealand who are making a separate submission. We support that submission. The Church supports the broad aims within the “Future of Tax, Submissions Background Paper” issued by the Tax Working Group. It agrees that the overall tax “system” needs to be fair in the way it collects tax revenue from individuals and businesses to ensure that all individuals and groups within society are able to contribute to the wellbeing in New Zealand society. The way that Parliament then priorities the use of the funds collected into government expenditure and capital payments is another matter and separate to the broad objectives of the Background Paper, but strongly linked. The Church has a strong view on social equity and justice that allows all New Zealanders to actively participate with family, community and New Zealand’s social, cultural and environmental development into the future. This must be a primary focus. The development and implementation of a tax revenue gathering system that allows this to occur as a primary goal should be established. Without a broad based and fair system of taxation, that does not meet this primary goal then the long-term vision of the government cannot be realised. The Church understands that the government (whichever colour that may be) has challenges, but it also has opportunities to deal with those challenges. Some governments choose to meet those challenges head on and engage with society about them while others cloud the issues with work arounds. The Church believes that most of New Zealand society is happy to engage and contribute to make New Zealand a better place which includes paying their fair share of taxation to support the primary objectives. Firstly, we applaud the Government in setting up the Tax Working Group and hope that it continues to be open and transparent in its workings and reporting to all New Zealanders. The Church would encourage the Tax Working Group to further educate and reach out to the community in its work so that as many voices are heard as possible. We also hope and pray that Parliament (the collective voice of all New Zealand) will support this opportunity to plan for the future of the tax system. While the current tax system has a revenue base centred on individual income tax, goods and services tax and company income tax, there is a perception that companies or businesses could do more to contribute. It is not only the taxation system that determines the total income stream of the Government. There are also “user pays” revenue generation aspects that contribute to the total revenue embedded in many pieces of legislation that are seen as “tax” in a different disguise. As the Tax Working Group note, international or offshore businesses make little or no contribution to the tax revenue and “export” their tax revenue to lower tax base countries. We believe that New Zealanders see this as unfair. Businesses who trade in New Zealand while based in other countries provide little in the way of a contribution to New Zealand society and could be seen as having a negative impact (lower employment). The Tax Working Group must deal with this imbalance even though international treaties may hinder this. The Church agrees that while the Tax Working Group is looking at the tax system, it should take a more strategic view of what the objective of the New Zealand tax system should be, and what it is trying to achieve for all of New Zealand (not only for the next five to ten years, but in the longer term). Major reviews of the tax system do not happen often and the tax system is often “played with” at the margins; the Church would encourage the Tax Working Group to “kick the ball around”. At the end of the journey, we may not have much change; however, we can at least say we gave it our best shot. The Government also needs to understand that while New Zealanders are fair and understanding, their pockets are not limitless. As the Background paper mentions, households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest income) pay around 35% of all income tax. At what point therefore would this group reach their limit and in a fair New Zealand tax system; what is fair for this group to contribute? At the other end of the scale, 50% of households are in the lowest five income deciles and pay less than 20% of all income tax. More needs to be done to lift this group’s income levels for the betterment of New Zealand society. This could mean lower tax rates for the lower decile family groups. Much of the information within the Background Paper is not new. For example, the aging population profile has been well documented for over a quarter of a century. There has always been a predicted “bubble” of the New Zealand population retiring in a large group. Successive governments have acknowledged and grappled with the issue but not really addressed it head on. Incentives for people to save for their retirement are small or non- existent. For younger people they have the added burden of student loans, high rents and high house prices to deal with, and will be required to contribute, through tax revenue, to support this bubble of retiring New Zealanders. In relation to charities and the work they undertake in New Zealand, it should be noted that charities have always received tax concessions of some type. Donations made by individuals and companies to charitable donee organisations may be claimed as a tax rebate. The Tax Working Group should note that it is the individual or company making the donation that receives the concession, not the Charity directly. This concession was recently adjusted to increase the amount able to be claimed. The Church understands that one reason for the increase was that Parliament understood the importance of charitable giving and it supported New Zealanders in this endeavour by providing them with the increase. Another concession received relates to income tax. Without going into the details of this concession, the concession is subject to a number of factors, including that any business income derived is applied to charitable purposes within New Zealand, and no person with control over the business activities of the charity is able to direct or divert income derived from the business to their benefit or advantage. There has been debate in some circles that the business income of charities (whatever that would mean) should be subject to tax (at some rate to be determined). The Church would question the effect on New Zealand society if that were to occur, and what the net result to society would be. Further, would the marginal increase in the tax revenue be warranted with the increased costs to monitor and enforce and more importantly would the loss of that marginal “cash” being withdrawn from the charitable sector place additional costs on society? Charities also receive concessions under fringe benefit tax rules. Parts of these concessions have been reviewed (eg. housing to Ministers) in recent years to clarify the position on fringe benefits in the charitable sector. The Church itself does pay some fringe benefit tax. While it understands that there is an exemption, it looks to make sure that it deals with the “intent” of the exemption and therefore if the benefit being supplied to a person does not meet the intended spirit of the exemption, it pays the tax. While there is some relief from goods and services tax in the Goods and Services Tax Act for charities, those provisions were made in light of submissions made at the time the Goods and Services Act was introduced to ensure fairness and that charities were not being disadvantaged due to the introduction of that Act.

My comments include the views expressed in conversations among the community group Transition Towns. My driving concern is the need to build local community resilience (local food, energy and economy) to be able to adapt the numerous threats bearing down on society. Fairness to all. Obviously taxation should be fairly apportioned among the whole community. The present situation appears to favour a certain portion of our society, generally the more wealthy, as against those less fortunate of our society. The resultant inequality ultimately would lead to a breakdown of society cohesion. Unfortunately for many reasons, there is a portion of our society who are less fortunate and it is therefore necessary for Governments to correct this well-being imbalance by providing health, education and other essential public services. Research has shown that societies that rate high in happiness, thus well-being, such as several northern hemisphere countries, tend to have higher taxation rates. This may suggest moving to a system that taxes capital rather than ones income. However there must be no room for loopholes/distortions as are currently occurring by the use of such facilities such as trusts. I certainly would be prepared to pay more tax if it meant our public services of education, health etc provide better well-being outcomes for all of our society. If we tax to provide prudent societal direction eg cigarettes, sugar, fossil fuel emissions – which I support – there must be counter move to compensate those less fortunate in our society that would be more directly affected. Is there a better way? The future points to an input/output taxation imbalance due to an increasing portion of society reaching retirement age while simultaneously there is a reduction of those at the tax paying age. Even currently there is insufficient tax to overcome child poverty, homelessness, inequality, housing affordability, fair wages to professions such as nurses, teachers, hospital waiting lists, infrastructure issues – the emerging list seems endless. The present financing of the above is via taxation and/or conventional private bank borrowing. The latter represents an interest liability to the Government’s (and Regional/District Councils) to the present unstable global ‘ponzi’ financial system. Many commentators are advising of an alternative including an IMF Working Paper titled “The Chicago Plan Revisited” . Banks create new money (out of thin air) all the time for their own profit so why shouldn’t governments do the same, to help finance the above mentioned issues. We have already a NZ example in the 1930s, when the then government created new money to enable the building of new state houses. Public unawareness of this obvious, as was mine until recently – and this also appears to be the case amongst our elected representatives. Obviously the banking industry would prefer it remain that way as illustrated by Don Brash’s recent denial of the same. May I recommend a link for further information: www.positivemoney.org.nz It is appropriate that the creation of credit by our Reserve Bank should be considered as part of the tax working group to ease the tax burden and reduce NZ’s overseas debt interest liability. Central v Local Government. NZ has another imbalance that needs readdressing - New Zealand’s Local Governments have the lowest proportional share of public expenditure relative to central government in the OECD. With the increasing need for local communities to build resilience to such threats as climate change, a larger portion of public expenditure should be allocated for communities to address their local concerns. Thank you Ross Clark PS – The recent number of local body/central government submissions to complete has left me little time to fully research your consultation documents and answer your direct questions. I trust you will allocate the appropriate comments from my submission accordingly please – thank you.

I have a longstanding personal and professional interest in tax issues. In the early-mid 1990s, while working at the Ministry for the Environment, I commissioned some of New Zealand’s first modelling of carbon and energy taxes. During the 2001 Tax Review I oversaw preparation of the Green Party’s submission to that review. More recent work, for a range of people, has included: • Providing advice on carbon pricing, and the general concept of ecological tax reform • Assessing proposals for land taxation and its relationship to ecological tax reform. • Evaluating the practical options for wealth taxation in New Zealand. • Reviewing evidence on the incidence of value-added taxes in New Zealand and internationally. My academic qualifications include a first class honours degree in economic theory, econometrics and financial history. I was awarded the Bernard Murphy prize in economics at the end of my honours year, as well as being offered a PhD scholarship by the New Zealand Treasury, which I declined. On a more personal note, when I was born in the mid-1960s, my parents were in their mid-40s. Both were themselves born in at the start of the 1920s. Both grew up before and during the Great Depression. Neither family was well-off. My mother was the first person in her family to finish primary school. Her father was the son of German immigrants and a carpenter, apprenticed at age 10. Her mother was war bride, transplanted to a foreign country, who had never attended school. My father’s father had been in prison and so was not eligible for welfare relief under the Forbes- Coates’ government. My father was several inches shorter than he ought to have been due to malnutrition during his teens. He was also passionate about the need to treat all life well and live within the limits of our planet. Economics and economic debate is too often lost in theoretical abstraction and ignores the human reality of proposals. I have seen first-hand both the lifelong effects of grinding child poverty and the power of public action to create a better future. My emphasis in this submission to encourage consideration of ideas which raise revenue to support public action while also encouraging and enabling a healthier society within a healthier world. This is a personal submission. If there is an opportunity to present submissions in person, I would welcome the chance to do so. My contact details are: I am happy for this submission to be made public. Ng a mihi nui \[1\] 3 Income Tax Comment New Zealand’s income tax schedule is has a number of unusual features, including: • The absence of tax-free band at the bottom • A relatively low top marginal tax rate • Increases in the marginal tax rate end at a relatively low level of income (about 1.4 times the median income) Proposal 1 Introduce a tax-free threshold of $10,000 Brief discussion: Tax free thresholds are expensive to introduce but highly progressive. If consideration is given to reductions in tax rates, introducing a tax free band ought to be high on the list of possible options. Tax-free thresholds also work well with concepts such as a guaranteed minimum income. Making the first $10,000 of income tax free would cost around $3-4 billion per annum, but would deliver significant benefits in terms of social equity and tax simplification. There are a variety of ways to fund such a threshold and it is one of the most effective ways of delivering a significant lump sum benefit to low-income people, including those on benefits. 2 Increase the threshold for the 33% rate to $100,000 and increase marginal rates at higher income levels to compensate. Brief discussion: New Zealand’s top marginal tax rate is 33%, and it begins at $70,000. Consideration could be given to a fiscally neutral increase in this threshold, funded by higher marginal rates on much higher incomes. One could for example, increase the commencement of the 33% rate to around $100,000 (roughly twice the median income) and introducing a rate of say 40% at $150,000 and 50% at $500,000 (three and ten times the median income respectively). Such a revenue-neutral change would help address poverty traps and incentives for middle-income households while providing clear signals around the implied social responsibilities which accompany very high salaries. Concerns are often raised around income switching between company taxation and individual income taxation with higher marginal income tax rates. As all company profits are either distributions or retained earnings, the core issue is actually the ability to disguise retained earnings, or manipulate accounts to give lower headline profits. These issues are important but not insurmountable from a tax compliance point of view. 4 Goods and Services Tax (GST) Comment New Zealand’s Goods and Services Tax is relatively simple and well-designed. It plays an important role in ensuring people who receive income from the “black economy” are captured by the tax system. Although modestly regressive in a technical sense, the exclusion of residential accommodation from the GST base makes the tax relatively neutral. GST is a very important part of an overall progressive and broadly based tax system. Proposal 3 Maintain a simple, broad base for the Goods and Services Tax and address social equity concerns by using GST revenue to deliver gains to those on low-incomes. Brief discussion: Increases in exemptions would bring added complexity while also being poorly targeted. Concerns for example about the cost of food for those on low incomes have led to exemptions for some or all food from value added tax in some countries. While such exemptions are (usually) progressive in a technical sense, this hides the fact that the vast bulk of revenue lost is, in an absolute sense, a gift those on relatively high incomes. Similarly the merits of changes in the overall GST rate depend very much on the use to which revenue is put. To illustrate this point somewhat starkly, consider two scenarios: 1. An increase in the GST rate to 17.5%, with the revenue used to fund a tax-free threshold. 2. A reduction in the GST rate to 12.5% with the reduced revenue replaced by borrowing. From a social equity perspective, the former reduces income inequality more than the latter. From a long term perspective, the second encourages consumption and borrowing at the expense of saving. 4 Re-examine the financial services exemption for GST Brief discussion: The exclusion of charges for (some, not all) financial services was originally justified on the grounds of complexity; the ongoing validity of this is worth examining further. Information technology and accounting requirements are both very different and more sophisticated than was the case when GST was introduced 22 years ago. 5 Ecological Tax Reform Comment The case for ecological tax reform has been well documented over many years. The submission of the Green Party to the 2001 Tax Review summarises this case. This is a public document and can downloaded from the archived 2001 Tax Review website. A large number of specific points are dated, but the document does cover the broad rationale for eco-taxes well. The rationales for ecological tax reform include: • Recovering associated financial costs • Improved economic efficiency • Accounting for externalities • Preserving ‘natural capital’ • Setting sustainability limits • Taxing biophysical flows From this broad perspective, there are numerous opportunities for ecological tax reform in New Zealand. The argument that some such taxes are not reliable sources of revenue because the tax base will shrink if the tax achieves its aim is an argument about whether to rely wholly on eco-taxes not an argument against using them as part of the tax mix. Proposal 5 Develop a specific work programme for a suite of ecological tax reforms. Brief discussion: There are a number of obvious and not so obvious candidates for ecological tax reform in New Zealand. A few examples include: • A tax on fossil carbon: A carbon tax would be both simpler and more effective than the current Emissions Trading Scheme. A hybrid model with a floor price and tradeability is also possible. Whatever the details of the design, there is a strong case for raising public revenue from the introduction of fossil carbon into the atmospheric commons. • A tax on non-bio-degradeable plastic and its precursors: Plastic waste is increasingly identified as a long-term hazard. There is a strong case for a tax on the production (or import) of non-biodegradeable plastic; this would be relatively simple to design and implement at the import and production level. • Resource rentals for the use of common resources: Discharges to air and the abstraction of natural water for commercial use are two clear areas where there is an argument for public revenue to be raised from the use of the commons. This point is distinct from taxes associated with the discharge of contaminants into air or water. • Charges for discharges of specific contaminants: The Resource Management Act is used to set ecological limits on discharges of specific contaminants. However up to those limits there is generally no cost for discharges. National charges on the discharge of contaminants would provide a financial incentive to reduce contaminants. 6 • A tax on the sugar content of processed foods: There are numerous opportunities in relation to human health; a ‘sugar tax’, levied at the point of production of processed and refined foods is one obvious example. A key caveat is to also ensure that the overall environment for food production supports healthy food, rather than simple substitution of other compounds with adverse long term affects. • Charges for the use of novel chemical compounds that do not exist in nature: In general, novel compounds tends to accumulate biologically. Taxation is one mechanism to encourage reduced use of such novel compounds. Lump Sum Taxes on Infrastructure Utilities Comment At present, New Zealand’s large commercial airports and electricity network provides are subject to a form of rate of return regulation. Even in this environment, they are highly profitable, and benefit from some flexibility in the way asset values are calculated. They also operated for many years with no regulation as to returns. The combination of these factors has arguably led to a significant (and ongoing) wealth transfer from the New Zealand public to the private owners of these essential facilities. At the same time, New Zealand faces an immediate need for capital funding for sustainable infrastructure, for example mass transit for travel to and from Auckland and Wellington airports. Proposal 6 Consider a lump sum tax Auckland and Wellington airports and large commercial electricity lines businesses Brief discussion: Rather than tighter regulation, one option for these entities is a lump-sum tax. A lump sum tax would be a charge to the balance sheet of these organisations, a one-off return of wealth to the common pool. To avoid perverse incentives, any debt associated with financing the charge would not count against net asset values and nor would any servicing costs be deductible for company tax purposes. This effectively would be a lump-sum capture of future excess profits. A brief inspection of the balance sheets of the two airports above suggests that Wellington could conservatively support a lump sum charge of between $500m and $1 billion, and Auckland a charge in the region of $2-4 billion. A similar analysis is possible for electricity lines businesses. 7 Land Tax Comment The unimproved value of land is at first glance an attractive tax base. Land is largely fixed and its ownership is known. The idea of taxing “unearned income” is attractive to many, as is the idea of reducing the incentives for land banking. In areas where one wants to create an incentive to maximise earnings from land, land tax can be an attractive and effective tool. However maximising earnings from land is far from a benign policy objective. There are many cases where land has ecological, cultural and social value beyond its income earning capacity. These values include biodiversity, heritage, and the general wellbeing effects from exposure to green spaces and the existence and persistence of familiar urban landmarks. A little reflection on the perspective of tangata whenua will reinforce understanding of the broader values associated with land – these are situational, particular and local. The “whenua” has meaning beyond its capacity to earn money. Proposal 7 Empower local and regional councils to use land tax to support sustainable transport infrastructure and discourage land banking but avoid a generalised land tax. Brief discussion: New Zealand’s historical experience with land and capital value rating demonstrates the power of land taxes. Land tax ought to be available to finance developments such as light rail in major centres. However, the decision about whether one wants to encourage land intensification in a particular location is fundamentally a local one. Protection of biodiversity on private land, provision of public amenities in private developments and the protection of heritage and character in urban areas 1 are all positive contributions to wellbeing. Land tax penalises this type of long term thinking and incentivises short-term financial gain. In some times and locations this incentive may be needed. Designing a national tax system that penalises these activities and then trying to manage the resulting adverse effects through regulation and complex exemptions is a poor approach to public policy. We want to encourage a greater sense of social and environmental responsibility in relation to rural and urban land and its use, and support tangata whenua in their role as kaitiaki of their rohe. A generalised land tax emphasises short-term earnings at the expense of these wider values. 1 There is discussion around the need for urban intensification in inner-Auckland. Heritage and character values are sometimes seen as conflicting with this, or seen as a smoke-screen for the wealthy to prevent more mixed land use. However this is an Auckland-specific issue rather than a general point. Lot sizes in Wellington, for example, were historically around half of those in Auckland and Wellington inner-suburbs such as Mt Victoria, Aro Valley and Mount Cook have quite high population densities especially if one excludes public reserve land from the area used to calculate density. These suburbs are also a diverse mix of rental and owner-occupied dwellings, with a wide dispersal of incomes. This reinforces the point that land tax is better suited to being a local tool, than a national one. 8 Taxing imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing Comment Imputed income is one of those apparently elegant ideas that bedevils economics. The idea in essence is that, if I own a house, I don’t have to pay rent and therefore have an implicit income that ought to be taxed to create equity between renters and home owners. The idea of imputed income is a useful thought experiment for thinking about some issues but it is an economic abstraction, not a tax base. The idea is theoretically incomplete and practical nonsense. Taxing capital gains is another issue, as is the idea of a wealth tax. Both have considerable merit. But the idea of taxing imputed income from housing is nonsense. Using an economic abstraction as a tax base is, in general, a bad idea. Proposal 8 Abandon any further consideration of a tax on imputed income from owner-occupied housing Brief discussion: From a theoretical point of view, the idea of taxing imputed income lacks a time dimension. To own an asset (in this case a house) a person first needs to either save or borrow. There is foregone consumption when one saves for a deposit, mortgages include an interest payment which may exceed the equivalent rental cost, and there is foregone consumption from the capital component of mortgage payments. All these reduce consumption from after tax income before the house is owned freehold. In very simple terms the rationale for taxing the “stream of benefits from home ownership” ignores the fact that to own an asset one has to save (in the sense of foregoing current consumption), or fund the asset through borrowing. This is much clearer if one considers that there is an “untaxed” stream of benefits from any owned asset such as a car, a washing machine, a bicycle or even a toaster. In short, there is a stream of benefits from any asset that lasts for any period of time. This does not create an inequity between renting and buying such an asset. At a practical level, it is true that people benefit from housing. Shelter is a basic human need. Some people gain financially from buying and selling houses. However that is not the only or, in most cases, the primary reason people own a house. Rather the core motivation for many if not most is the very basic human need for security and shelter. This is not a tax base. 9 Wealth taxation (including property taxation) Comment Growing inequality in both income and wealth has been a feature of the Western world over the last 40 years. New Zealand has been no exception and I don’t propose to document this trend or its adverse effects here. I trust both are simply accepted as data. Taxation of wealth is a simple idea but one which is fraught in detail. This is simply because wealth is fungible and ephemeral. Income over a lifetime contributes to wealth yet wealth is also not as closely correlated with income at any one point in time as might be thought. There are for example, some very wealthy people in the lowest income decile. Asset values are also far more volatile than incomes. New Zealanders think of house prices as rising steadily but this is far from guaranteed, and prices for assets such as gold, art and shares can fluctuate wildly. Wealth also needs to be considered over a lifetime. Older people generally have more assets than younger people. All this is not to say wealth taxation is impossible or undesirable, simply that it is harder than might be thought to define the tax base in a way that both generates revenue and is socially just. This line of thought often leads people to consider land tax, but as has already been noted it has serious disadvantages as a national tax base. If property is the starting point for wealth taxation, then the capital value of property is much more apt tax base as it delivers many of the benefits with fewer of the drawbacks. While it lacks the theoretical elegance of land tax, its practical implications are very similar. Proposal 9 Generate more accurate statistics on wealth Brief discussion: Beyond property and possibly shares and savings, solid data on wealth is hard to locate. Building a more accurate picture of how wealth is held and how its value changes is a necessary pre-requisite to an informed discussion on broadly-based wealth taxation. 10 Introduce a low-level tax on a subset of wealth with a generous exemption threshold Brief discussion: Property ownership, shareholding and financial assets are reasonably well defined and documented in New Zealand. Personal debt is also well documented within the financial system. A low-level wealth tax (say around 0.25%) on the combined annual value of these, with an exemption for (say) the first $1 million of combined net value, is worth evaluating further. One advantage of a more broadly-based tax than purely property is that it encompasses assets that can be liquidated to pay wealth tax, and therefore liability tends to have some responsiveness to ability to pay (ie if you liquidate assets your future tax bill is lower). A net wealth approach also reflects ability to pay, as if one needs to borrow to pay the tax, the future tax bill is then concomitantly lower. A sizeable threshold level allows for the accumulation and decumulation of assets over a lifetime, while still ensuring the tax helps address structural inequity in wealth. 10 Capital Gains Tax Comment The case for a capital gains tax is reasonably clear. Capital gains represent a form of unearned income which is untaxed. Unlike the imputed rental argument, capital gains are a genuine form of income, albeit unrealised. Realisation-based capital gains taxes can also play an important role in smoothing asset value fluctuations as changes in tax liability move in the opposite direction to prices. Capital gains taxes are complementary to wealth taxes rather than a substitute for them; CGT is a form of income taxation, distinct from tax on accumulated wealth. The relationship between then is through impacts on the value of net wealth, as is the case for all income taxes. Proposal 11 Introduce a realisation based capital gains tax on changes in the real value of capital assets above a certain threshold Brief discussion: There is a balance to be struck between avoiding undue imposts due to asset price fluctuations and creating a disincentive to the turnover of assets. Using real values helps reduce this tension as does a realisation basis. However there may be some need for an intermediate or hybrid design which limits the size of accumulated tax liability relative to the value of an asset. Tax and benefit system integration Comment New Zealand’s income support system is neither particularly generous nor particularly encouraging. The Working for Families scheme led to a measurable reduction in inequality but creates very high effective marginal tax rates. Base payments are low for beneficiaries and again abatement rates are steep. Family-based income support and individual-based taxation systems can interact in ways that create significant poverty traps. 11 Proposal 12 Overhaul income support systems to create a more generous and less conditional minimum income and integrate income support better with the tax system Brief discussion: Others will likely address this approach more fully, but a shift from discrete income support and taxation systems to a more integrated system will generate significant benefits for those on low and middle incomes. The idea of negative income tax has a bad name because of its political origins but the basic concept of defining a minimum income and using the tax system to deliver a gradually diminishing top up has merit as an integrated approach to income support. Defining a universal basic entitlement and then using the system to deliver top ups avoids many of the problems created by the separation of income support and taxation. This approach complements the minimum wage / living wage system. These employment based models ensures enterprise face the true cost of labour, including the social costs. List of specific proposals 1. Introduce a tax-free threshold of $10,000 2. Increase the threshold for the 33% rate to $100,000 and increase marginal rates at higher income levels to compensate. 3. Maintain a simple, broad base for the Goods and Services Tax and address social equity concerns by using GST revenue to deliver gains to those on low-incomes. 4. Re-examine the financial services exemption for GST 5. Develop a specific work programme for a suite of ecological tax reforms. 6. Consider a lump sum tax Auckland and Wellington airports and large commercial electricity lines businesses 7. Empower local and regional councils to use land tax to support sustainable transport infrastructure and discourage land banking but avoid a generalised land tax. 8. Abandon any further consideration of a tax on imputed income from owner-occupied housing 9. Generate more accurate statistics on wealth 10. Introduce a low-level tax on a subset of wealth with a generous exemption threshold 11. Introduce a realisation based capital gains tax on changes in the real value of capital 12.

Page | 1 Rachel and Simon Darmody 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Via email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax Thank you for the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group: Future of Tax. Background We are ordinary New Zealanders. Growing up in rural New Zealand in the 1980’s we experienced the effects of Rogernomics on rural communities. This taught us the importance of saving not spending, being resilient and providing for yourself. We worked from an early age, saved and made sacrifices in order to go to university. At the time we attended university, students paid full fees and the interest rate on student loans was higher than mortgage rates. While other people were holidaying and spending up large on consumable items we saved to pay off the student loan and to get a deposit for our first home. It would have been nice to spend money on expensive cars, gadgets and holidays but it was important to us to build a secure financially sound plan. We delayed having children until we could afford them and still make choices on what we spend our time doing and money on in order to raise a family and provide for our future. The media and government regularly pushed the importance of delayed gratification and saving for your retirement so we chose to invest in residential properties as a foundation for our retirement plan. We also felt we were contributing to society by providing homes for people who rent. We now have a relatively modest portfolio of residential properties, like many other New Zealand families who have made similar choices but the tone has changed and we now seem to be labelled as lucky and greedy and portrayed as not paying our fair share of tax. The Tax Working Group document is particularly disappointing with repeated comments on growing concerns about inequality, fairness and taxation on assets and wealth, with the comment of ‘a renewed interest in wealth taxes internationally despite the falling use of them in practise’, which implies that these will be focussed on in an attempt to appease lobby groups. These all look like an attempt at creating an environment to introduce Envy taxes with the sole intention of punishing people who have made sacrifices and choices to provide a strong financial future for themselves. Submission \[1\] Page | 2 Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future- focussed tax system? 1. It is important to encourage people to take responsibility for their own future, save, work hard and invest for the future. Some of the changes proposed are focusing on taxing wealth or land. It is important to highlight that taxing an asset’s value does not mean that there is an associated income to pay the tax from. Envy taxes immediately springs to mind in relation to people owning a bach or crib that would not meet the ‘family home’ test and potentially subject to additional taxes. This could destroy a long and valued kiwi tradition of owning a special place to spend the holidays with family and friends. Many of these have been handed down over generations and have involved many compromises and sacrifices to keep these special places in the family and continue the valued tradition. Many of these proposals would take away the spirit and desire for what has been a cherished and important part of living in New Zealand. In this hectic and faced-paced world the importance on health and wellbeing and providing a sense of purpose to have a place to de-stress and spend time with family and friends should not be underestimated. Punishing the people who have worked hard to obtain these will have wide ranging negative aspects on both the local economies and wellbeing of the individuals. In most cases these little places are not located in areas people would want to live permanently and generally not suitable for permanent living anyway. Introducing changes that could force these to be sold would destroy the special memories of the families and friends and increase and leave these families with a huge sense of loss and resentment towards the government that forced this on them. Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment. What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Defining ‘fairness’. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? 2. The current broad based system strikes a good balance to encourage people to save, work hard and invest for the future. Some of the changes proposed are focusing on taxing wealth or land. It is important to highlight that there is no revenue or income stream from an assets increase in value and there are also periods of times where assets decline in value. We do not agree with any tax that is based on the value of an asset as there may not be sufficient income or revenue received to be able to pay these taxes from and in our opinion are very unfair to people who hold those assets that are being targeted. Chapter 4: The current New Zealand Tax System Frameworks: New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Page | 3 3. The current broad based system is easy to understand and implement and has a good balance to encourage people to save, work hard and invest for the future. Some of the changes proposed are focusing on taxing wealth or land. It is important to highlight that there is no revenue or income stream from an assets increase in value and there are also periods of times where assets decline in value. We do not agree with any tax that is based on asset values as in there is no income or revenue received to be able to pay these taxes from and in our opinion are very unfair to people who hold those assets that are being targeted. Taxes and Behaviour: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? 4. The tax system should not be used to discourage people from investing in property. This sector contributes to society by providing housing because the government is unable to provide all of the housing required and not everyone wants to own their own house. Targeting this sector, through taxation, will reduce the available rental stock at a time when more is needed. Retirement savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 5. No. People should be allowed the flexibility to be able to choose how they provide for their retirement based on their individual circumstances. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? 6. There has been much talk throughout the document about fairness, balance and inequality but there seems to be no distinction between property speculators and property investors. Property investors are buying for the long term. The bright line test does a good job of addressing this but some of these proposed taxes will affect the ability of investors to pay these extra taxes and also be able to reduce their mortgage to a level where the income will provide for their retirement. People who have made sacrifices and worked towards a long- term plan to provide for themselves will now be dependent on the government to provide for them in retirement. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? 7. No new wealth or envy taxes should be introduced for New Zealanders. Page | 4 8. Ring fencing of losses should not be implemented. Rental property investment is a business. All businesses can offset their costs and losses against other income. Disallowing it for one sector is not promoting fairness in the tax system. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability. How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 9. Ring fencing losses for rental property owners does not promote a fair or balanced system as all other businesses are allowed to offset losses. Just because residential property has a higher emotional component than commercial or other investments does not mean this sector should be unfairly targeted with additional taxes. Capital gains tax: Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 10. New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax as this will discourage people from investing in assets. The current bright line test is sufficient. Land Tax: Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 11. New Zealand should not introduce a Land Tax just because it looks an easy option to implement and administer as this will unfairly penalise people who have invested in property for their retirement income and will see a huge reduction in the availability of rental properties. 12. A Land Tax would increase the costs to owners of providing rental properties and will lead to reduced supply of rental properties and increases to rental prices which is likely to result in overcrowding in available properties. 13. All goods and services will increase in price as a direct result of implementing a Land Tax as business costs would increase as a result of this. 14. Land Tax is an area where it needs to be highlighted that taxing an asset means many people will not have the income to pay the tax. The value of an asset is not income and introducing this will have a significant negative impact on people. We do not wish to be heard in support of this submission.
