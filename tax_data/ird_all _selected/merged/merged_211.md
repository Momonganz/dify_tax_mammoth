Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department IN SUMMARY IN SUMMARY Legislation and determinations Determination FDR 2019/01 - Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (ISAM Systematic Trend – Class Q shares) This determination applies to an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund, being a direct income interest in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend. This is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from the interest. 4 Determination FDR 2019/02 – Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund) Any investment by a New Zealand resident investor in units in the Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund is a type of attributing interest for which the investor may use the Fair Dividend Rate method to calculate Foreign Investment Fund income from the interest. 5 Determination: EE001 Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment This determination provides employers with the option of applying certain percentages to make an allocation between business use and private use of telecommunications tools and usage plans. The option will reduce business compliance costs. 7 Determination CFC 2019/05: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited) CFC 2019/05 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Vanuatu. 14 Determination CFC 2019/04: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited) CFC 2019/04 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in Tonga. 15 Determination CFC 2019/03: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited) CFC 2019/03 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFCs resident in Fiji. 16 Determination CFC 2019/02: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited) CFC 2019/02 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFCs resident in Papua New Guinea. 17 Determination CFC 2019/01: Non-attributing active insurance CFC status (TOWER Insurance Limited) CFC 2019/01 applies to TOWER Insurance Limited and grants non-attributing active CFC status to the specified insurance CFC resident in the Cook Islands. 18 Public rulings BR Pub 19/05: Income tax – treatment of alteration to rights attached to shares under section CB 4; BR Pub 19/06: Income tax – treatment of a disposal of shares with altered rights under section CB 4 The rulings concern an arrangement where a shareholder holds shares in a company and the shares were acquired for the purpose of disposal. They conclude that an alteration of share rights does not result in a disposal of personal property for the purposes of s CB 4, and the time of acquisition of the shares where the rights attached to them are altered after acquisition is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. 20 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 1 IN SUMMARY (continued) Interpretation statement IS 19/04 - Income tax - distributions from foreign trusts This interpretation statement discusses the tax treatment of amounts of money and property received by NZ residents from overseas, including by inheritance, that are potentially distributions from trusts. It covers how to determine if the amounts actually come from a trust (especially when another country has no law of trusts, or the law is different to NZ), whether anything is beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust and when and how the ordering rules in s HC 16 might mean they are treated as taxable distributions when they might not otherwise appear to be. It also considers the law of administration of deceased estates to help determine at what point a trust might arise to make distributions taxable. 28 Questions we’ve been asked QB 19/15: If property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? This Question We’ve Been Asked is part of a series of guidance on the income tax and GST consequences of providing short-stay accommodation through peer-to-peer websites such as Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses. It explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust. 59 QB 19/16: If property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? This Question We’ve Been Asked is part of a series of guidance on the income tax and GST consequences of providing short-stay accommodation through peer-to-peer websites such as Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Houses. It explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees. 65 Standard practice statement SPS 19/05 – options for relief from child support debt This statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice for providing relief when the immediate payment of an overdue child support or domestic maintenance obligation is not possible. The relief is provided in the form of an agreement to pay the debt in instalments; writing off penalties in certain situations; or in limited circumstances, writing off part or all of the child support debt. 73 Operational statement OS 19/05: Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax This statement is intended to clarify and simplify the tax rules around employer-provided travel to distant workplaces - for example, a person who works in Wellington but lives in Auckland, or who may travel greater distances in working from home or at multiple workplaces. 84 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 IN SUMMARY (continued) Legal decisions - case notes High Court upholds TRA decision regarding Income Tax, GST and PAYE assessments and TAA ss 108 and 108A time bar This is an appeal from a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) regarding Mr Dowden’s challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“Commissioner”) PAYE, GST and INC assessments for tax periods between January 2004 and May 2012. These assessments concerned several businesses run by Mr Dowden, including Safeguard Security (“Safeguard”). Mr Dowden claimed to have transferred his interest in Safeguard to his former partner, Ms Jackson, in December 2003. Mr Dowden’s case was that Ms Jackson was liable for tax relating to Safeguard between January 2004 and December 2011. The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessments. The TRA held that Mr Dowden had not ceased to trade as Safeguard from January 2004 to December 2011 and also that the Commissioner was not bound by the limitation periods in ss 108 and 108A of the TAA. 94 Commissioner successful in donations GST case This proceeding was a tax challenge in relation to reassessments made for six GST periods (from the tax year ended 31 March 2012 to the tax year ended 31 March 2015) to include payments that the disputant, CD Trust, has treated as not being subject to GST. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) and upheld the reassessments (during the preparation for the hearing the Commissioner’s investigator identified that there were errors in the calculations underlying the assessments and recalculated what the correct amount of the assessments should be. The Taxation Review Authority varied the assessments accordingly pursuant to s 138P of the TAA.) 95 Court of Appeal dismisses appeal of application for judicial review of child support assessment The Court of Appeal dismissed P’s appeal and accepted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“CIR”) had acted correctly in changing P’s child support entitlement to nil. 96 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 3 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination FDR 2019/01 - Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (ISAM Systematic Trend – Class Q shares) Reference This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discussion (which does not form part of the determination) Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend, to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund for New Zealand resident investors. ISAM Systematic Trend holds directly or indirectly assets of which 80% or more are financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors hedge their attributing interests in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994. I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate foreign investment fund income from their attributing interests in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend. Although ISAM Systematic Trend directly or indirectly invests in assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not similar to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment. Scope of determination This determination applies to Class Q shares held by New Zealand resident investors in ISAM Systematic Trend. The ISAM Systematic Trend’s investment objective is to grow the value of its assets, providing returns with low correlations to the stock and bond markets through the implementation of systematic trading models. ISAM Systematic Trend achieves its investment objectives by primarily investing in ISAM Systematic Trend Master. ISAM Systematic Trend Master trades primarily in global futures, swaps and forward contracts including with respect to stock indices, interest rates, currencies, energy commodities, agriculture and metals, as well as in over-the-counter spot foreign exchange and metals transactions. This determination is made subject to the following conditions: 1) The investment in Class Q shares in ISAM Systematic Trend is not part of an overall arrangement that provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure. 2) The absolute value of ISAM Systematic Trend’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days. Should this occur, the determination ceases to apply from the first day of the following quarter.

Haydn Clark Technical Specialist Determination FDR 2019/02 – Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund (Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund) Reference This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the position of Technical Specialist, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Discussion (which does not form part of the determination) Shares in the Russell Investments Multi Strategy Volatility Fund (“Russell MSV Fund”), to which this determination applies, are attributing interests in a foreign investment fund (“FIF”) for New Zealand resident investors. The investments held by the Russell MSV Fund consist predominantly of financial arrangements providing funds to a person. In addition, some New Zealand resident investors hedge their attributing interests in the Russell MSV Fund back to New Zealand dollars. Therefore, section EX 46(10)(cb) of the Income Tax Act 2007 would apply to prevent those investors from using the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994. I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from their attributing interest in the Russell MSV Fund. Although the Russell MSV Fund invests in assets predominantly comprising financial arrangements and New Zealand resident investors may enter into related New Zealand dollar hedging arrangements, the overall arrangement contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt investment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Scope of determination This determination applies to shares held by New Zealand resident investors in the Russell MSV Fund. The Russell MSV Fund achieves its investment objectives by investing in global equity indices and volatility indices through derivative instruments (exchange traded or over-the-counter and including futures and options) with the aim of removing directional or market exposure and for hedging or efficient portfolio management purposes. For the purposes of covering the derivative positions, the Russell MSV Fund also invests in cash and cash equivalents (including money market instruments, cash deposits, commercial paper and certificates of deposit). This determination is made subject to the following conditions: 1) The investment in the Russell MSV Fund is not part of an overall arrangement that provides the New Zealand resident investor with a return that is equivalent to an effective New Zealand dollar denominated interest exposure. 2) The absolute value of the Russell MSV Fund’s notional derivative exposure must not fall to 20% or less of its Net Asset Value for a continuous period of 45 days.

John Trezise Technical Specialist Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Determination EE001: Employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment Reimbursements or reimbursing allowances in relation to employee use of telecommunications tools and usage plans in their employment are taxable and subject to PAYE unless specifically exempt. Section CW 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allows reimbursements or reimbursing allowances to be exempt to the extent that an employee would be allowed a deduction if they incurred the expenditure and the employment limitation did not exist. Evidence is required to demonstrate a ‘nexus’ between incurring the expenditure and deriving income. Under s CW 17(2) a reimbursement may be exempt or under s CW 17(3) a reasonable estimate of the amount of expenditure may be exempt. In this context a reasonable estimate is one that has some objective basis. For example, the estimate might be based on actual historical data or employee survey information. Employers must retain sufficient information about how the estimate was determined to substantiate the amount. This Determination provides employers with the option of applying certain percentages to make an allocation between business use and private use for usage plans related to telecommunications tools based on the level of business use. There is also a de minimis level of payment that may be treated as exempt income. As a means of providing flexibility and reducing compliance costs this Determination allows lesser requirements for the provision of evidence when applying the percentages or the de minimis class. The requirements may involve signed declarations from employees in lieu of other evidence of use, an employment policy to establish an obligation to use telecommunications tools and in the case of the de minimis class there is no evidence requirement. The option to use this Determination will reduce business compliance costs. Determination This Determination is made under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Determination applies to the arrangements described and in circumstances where employees use their own telecommunications tools in their employment and also use the tools for private use. It may also apply where the employer provides payments in relation to usage plans only. Employers reimburse employees or provide reimbursing allowances which involve estimates being made. This Determination can be relied on for the required apportionment. This Determination relates to the following arrangements, which comprise three classes: Class A, Class B and the De Minimis Class. Class A: Principally business use, covers situations where: • • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and • • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • • the telecommunications tools and usage plan are principally used by the employee in their employment, and the employee also uses the tools and usage plan or usage plan alone for private use; and • • there may be an amount relating to depreciation loss. Class B: Principally private use, covers situations where: • • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and • • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • • the employee is required to use telecommunications tools and usage plan in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tools and usage plan or usage plan alone for private use; and • • there may be an amount relating to depreciation loss. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS The De Minimis Class covers situations where: • • an employer enters into an arrangement with the employee whereby the employee will provide their own telecommunications tools and usage plan, or the arrangement involves the employee using their own usage plan; and • • the employee incurs the cost of the telecommunications tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone and there is reimbursement; or • • a reimbursing allowance represents a reasonable estimate of the likely expenditure to be incurred by the employee; and • • the employee is required to use telecommunications tools and a usage plan in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tools and usage plan for private use; and • • there is a payment of no more than $5 per week per employee, amounting to no more than $265 per year per employee, as a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to the use of telecommunications tools and a usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone. Class A For Class A cases, employers can treat 75% of the amount paid (total bill amount) either by reimbursement or by a reimbursing allowance for usage plans, as exempt income of the employee. The extent to which the payment is taxable is 25%. If the employer pays 75% of the total bill as a reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount paid is exempt. Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. Class B For Class B cases, employers can treat 25% of the amount paid (total bill amount) either by reimbursement or by a reimbursing allowance for usage plans, as exempt income of the employee. The extent to which the payment is taxable is 75%. If the employer pays 25% of the total bill as an reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount paid is exempt. Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. De Minimis Class A payment up to $5 per week, amounting to no more than $265 per year, per employee, as reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to telecommunication tools and a usage plan can be treated as exempt income of the employee. This is in circumstances where the employee uses telecommunications tools in employment and incurs expenditure. Limitations on the scope of this Determination Additional and supplementary telecommunications tools If the employer provides telecommunications tools, then the employer should not also be paying a reimbursing allowance, which is exempt income, for use of the employee’s own telecommunications tools of that type. However, an employer who provides employees with laptops can also have a bring your own device (“BYOD”) plan for cell phones or home internet connections. Additional remuneration or salary sacrifice This Determination does not apply if the amount paid is materially more than the actual plan costs or if there is evidence of the amounts being taken into account in remuneration levels so that a salary sacrifice arrangement exists. Section CW 17(2C) does not permit a Determination under s 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to apply to salary sacrifice arrangements. The inclusion of a telecommunications benefit in a salary statement to document the reimbursing allowance does not by itself indicate a salary sacrifice arrangement. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) This Determination does not apply where there is no employment income under the arrangement, that is, where the employer provides the telecommunications tool and pays for the usage. In such circumstances there may be FBT implications. It is noted that s CX 21 provides an exemption for business tools. Determination is not binding on employer or employee This Determination is not binding on the employer or the employee. If the employer or employee has evidence to demonstrate that, in their particular circumstance, some other apportionment is appropriate under s CW 17, the taxpayer may apply that apportionment.

Does the employer  reimburse the  employee for costs  the employee incurs  on their device and  usage plan (or usage  plan alone)? Does the employer pay a  reimbursing allowance to the  employee that represents a  reasonable estimate of the  likely expenditure to be  incurred by the employee?

Example 1: Class A – Reimbursing allowance An employee brings their own telecommunications tool to work and uses it in the course of their work. The telecommunications tool is principally used for work. In recognition of that, the employer pays a reimbursing allowance of the total monthly account of $60 per month to the employee. A portion of this payment ($45) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. Under Class A, a 75% portion of the reimbursing allowance ($45) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. This Determination (for Class A) can be relied on in lieu of establishing the apportionment of usage. Example 2: Depreciation An employer has an optional BYOD policy. Employees who opt into the policy must return their employer-provided laptop and use their own laptop and associated equipment instead. Under this policy, employees must use a laptop that meets certain specifications. The employee must also purchase a mouse, keyboard and docking station to use at their workplace. This arrangement is within Class A. The employer estimates that the average cost of a laptop that meets the required specifications and associated equipment is $1,500. The cost of this device and equipment per year is subject to a depreciation calculation made using the Commissioner’s rates for the items. The employee can receive an amount calculated as depreciation loss (75% of that amount) annually as exempt income. Example 3: Class B – Reimbursing allowance An employee uses their home internet connection to do work for their employer, and the employer pays the employee a monthly reimbursing allowance of $60. It is understood that the reimbursing allowance is sufficient to cover both business use and private use, on the basis that it covers the total monthly account. The employee is required to use the home internet connection in their employment, but employment is not the principal use. There is some actual business use. Under Class B, a 25% portion of the reimbursing allowance ($15) can be treated as exempt income to the employee. This Determination (for Class B) can be relied on in lieu of establishing the apportionment of usage. Example 4: Reimbursement equal to or below business use percentage An employer makes a monthly reimbursement payment of $25 to the employee. The home internet plan costs the employee $100 per month. The employer has evidence that the $25 reimbursement will cover monthly business use because business use amounts to at least 25%. The monthly payment by the employer is equal to the business use percentage, so it is unnecessary to make a private use apportionment. The amount would be fully exempt under s CW 17. Example 5: De minimis payment An employer makes a monthly reimbursement payment of $20 to the employee. The employee must use their telecommunications tool in their employment based on a business reason and also uses the tool for private use. The payment is exempt income given it does not exceed the de minimis threshold of a payment up to $5 per week, amounting to no more than $265 per year. Example 6: Second mobile phone An employer provides a mobile phone for work purposes that is also available for private use. The employer reimburses or pays an reimbursing allowance for a second mobile phone for the employee. No additional facts indicate that the employee needs two phones for business purposes such as specifically needing separate phone numbers. This Determination cannot be relied on in relation to the usage plan for the second mobile phone. The reimbursement or reimbursing allowance amount is likely to be employment income and not exempt. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Example 7: Salary sacrifice An employer provides an amount of $1,000 per month for telecommunications tools as part of a salary package. The employee spends $100 per month on the internet (usage) plan. This Determination cannot be relied on. The amount is employment income to the extent it relates to private use. Example 8: Employee needs to be contacted at any time An employee needs to be able to be contacted at any time to deal with work related matters. While the level of usage of the plan is less than 50% these facts still meet the principal use test. Class A applies and employers can treat 75% of the amount reimbursed or provided as an allowance as exempt income of the employee. If the employer paid the employee 75% or less of the total cost of the telecommunications tool the full reimbursement or reimbursing allowance would be exempt. Example 9: Leave of absence An employee has been assessed as receiving a Class A reimbursement. The employee receives a reimbursing allowance of $100 per month, of which $75 is tax exempt. The employee takes 6 weeks annual leave, during which the employee is not contactable for work purposes. As this is a temporary arrangement, any reimbursing allowance payments during the annual leave period remain 75% tax exempt. Commentary (which does not form part of this Determination) Purpose of Determination 1.1 Section CW 17 provides an exemption for certain payments to or made on behalf of an employee. The payments are in connection with an employee’s employment or service and are for the employee’s job-related expenditure. Often this expenditure might also have a private element. Under s CW 17, apportionment is required for this private element. 1.2 This Determination allows the employer to use the relevant percentage for the taxable portion of the payment to the employee, if the requirements set out in this Determination are met and the employer considers that it is preferable not to commit resource to establishing the actual percentage. 1.3 This Determination applies where the payment covers both business use and private use and the proportion is not ascertained. Other options 1.4 Employers do not have to apply this Determination. Section CW 17 provides the basis to apportion when this Determination is not applied. Arrangement 1.5 Many employers have a policy of agreeing to or allowing employees to bring their own telecommunications tools to work for business use, or agreeing to the business use of the employee’s usage plan and telecommunications tools. There also may be an understanding that the employee will use the tools or usage plan away from work for business purposes. This has the benefits of convenience, flexibility, increased productivity and cost savings. It also results in reimbursement or reimbursing allowances paid to the employee in relation to the costs of the telecommunications tools and usage plan. There may be a depreciation loss in using these devices. The acquisition cost of any telecommunications tool is not itself a depreciation loss. 1.6 This Determination relates to an arrangement whereby an employer reimburses an employee or employees for the cost of usage plans for telecommunications tools, or the employer reasonably estimates the amount of expenditure and pays a reimbursing allowance. There may also be payments relating to depreciation loss. 1.7 This Determination applies to a variety of arrangements. They may be described as BYOD plans, whereby the employer and employee agree on a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance for the employee because the employee uses their own telecommunications tools for work. Arrangements vary and the usage plan may include the supply of telecommunications tools 1.8 The arrangements include variations where the usage plan also involves the supply of a telecommunications tool as part of the plan. The arrangements may vary as to what particular telecommunications tools and usage plans are included. They may vary as to whether there is a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance in relation to an on-going service plan. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 1.9 This Determination operates to allow a percentage of any costs relating to a usage plan or depreciation loss as exempt income. There is also a de minimis acceptable level of payment. Usage plan only 1.10 The arrangement includes the employer providing the telecommunications tools and then reimbursing the employee for the cost of the employee’s usage plan or estimating the amount of reimbursement. Fringe benefit tax implications are not covered 1.11 FBT implications are not covered by this Determination. Payment can be made in different ways 1.12 Payment could be made to an employee in a variety of ways. There could be a reimbursing allowance or an exact reimbursement of costs. This Determination applies to these types of payment that cover both business use and private use. Private use could involve allowing household use. 1.13 This Determination does not provide a percentage or reasonable estimate for expenditure on account of an employee. Employment requirement 1.14 In all cases, the payment is made because the telecommunications tools are required for the employee to do their job. In this respect, the telecommunications tools: • • are used when the employee is performing an obligation required by their employment or service; • • the employee derives employment income through the performance of the obligation; • • the expenditure is necessary in the performance of the obligation. If payment only meets cost of business use, amount would be fully exempt 1.15 If the reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance can be evidenced as being an amount that does not exceed the actual or reasonable estimate of business use then it would be fully exempt under s CW 17. Depreciation loss would be added to other costs. For example a monthly value for depreciation loss would be added to monthly usage plan costs to establish the total cost for the employee. A reimbursement, including the depreciation loss, that did not exceed the estimate of business use would be fully exempt under s CW 17. De minimis allowance 1.16 There is also a de minimis allowance when a reimbursement or a reimbursing allowance is no more than $5 per week, or $265 per year, per employee. This level of expenditure is unlikely to involve private use. In such cases, the reimbursing allowance or reimbursement will be exempt income. If this level of expenditure is not exceeded, there is no requirement to hold any evidence in support of the expenditure. Acquisition cost of telecommunications tools is not covered; an amount of depreciation loss is covered 1.17 The telecommunications tools are likely to be capital assets, and the initial payment for these would not be expenditure on account under s CW 17 because they would be subject to the capital limitation in s DA 2(1). Telecommunications tools are identifiable assets of an enduring benefit. Therefore, the initial cost of the telecommunications tool is excluded when applying this Determination. The usage plan in some cases may include any cost for the telecommunications tools and the cost is effectively paid off over the minimum sign up period. In these cases there is no need to consider depreciation further as the full cost of the usage plan is subject to the relevant percentage for exempt income under Class A or Class B. 1.18 This Determination can include an amount that represents an amount for depreciation of the telecommunications tool. Section CW 17(4) states that for the purposes of s CW 17 expenditure, the expenditure can include an amount of depreciation loss. If the telecommunications tool costs $500 or less, the amount of the depreciation loss is the cost of the tool (see s EE 38). 1.19 Employers may estimate the cost of telecommunications tools for the purpose of depreciation, and then apply the applicable ratio to the estimated depreciation loss. The estimate should be based on the depreciation rates the Commissioner has set. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Class A, Class B and the De Minimis Class are covered 1.20 This Determination covers three classes: Class A, Class B, and the De Minimis Class. 1.21 Under the classes an employer can make a payment or reimbursement in relation to the telecommunication tools and the usage plan or the cost of the usage plan alone. Class A – telecommunications tools are principally used in employment 1.22 Class A covers arrangements where the telecommunications tools are principally used in employment. Meaning of “principally used” 1.23 Principally used’, the basis for Class A arrangements, means the main or primary use of the telecommunications tools in these arrangements is for use in employment. Reasonable judgement can be exercised 1.24 As is the case when making an apportionment under s CW17 reasonable judgement must be exercised as to the level of business use and there would be some reasonable evidential basis based on time spent or a staff survey. 1.25 However, it may be difficult to determine the level of use precisely and this Determination is intended to allow less than precise estimation. The employer may rely on some evidence of time spent, or for the purposes of this Determination, an employer may in the absence of any other evidence choose to obtain a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be principally used in employment. 1.26 It is expected that the situation would be reviewed periodically to check that the level of use remains the same. A review once every two years would be adequate. If an employer has obtained a signed declaration from an employee that telecommunications tools will be principally used in employment then a review is only required if there has been a material change to the employee’s circumstances. 1.27 In some cases, the importance of the employee having access to the telecommunications tools might mean that principal use is established. For example, an employee might need to be available at all times for calls. This factor on its own, does not mean there is principal use of the telecommunications tools for employment purposes. In some cases, data or expected usage could indicate a less than 50% usage, but the importance of availability might be a factor resulting in the principal use test being met. Implications 1.28 Employers can treat 75% of the amount paid either by reimbursement or by reimbursing allowance for usage plans and depreciation loss (if any) as exempt income of the employee. If employers pay 75% of the total usage charge as reimbursement or allowance, then the whole amount paid by the employer will be exempt. 1.29 If the employer pays a fixed amount per month the employer could obtain a declaration from the employee that the employee’s costs are at least 1.33 times the amount of the reimbursing allowance paid. The whole amount paid by the employer will be exempt. Class B – arrangements where telecommunications tools are required, but not principally used for employment 1.30 Class B covers arrangements where the telecommunications tools are still required for employment, but the tools are not principally used for employment. There must be an employment reason for the use of the telecommunications tools. 1.31 Class B provides a second-tier option. This enables a reduction in the compliance costs involved in the active measurement of use. An employment reason still exists for the use of the telecommunications tools. Employers apply a lesser percentage for exempt income of 25%. Employment policy is sufficient to show employment-use obligation 1.32 Class B is intended to cover arrangements where there is an employment reason and an obligation for the employee to use the tools, but private use is predominant. An established employment policy related to the use of the tools would be sufficient to establish the obligation. It is expected that there would be actual business use of the tools over time. Access to telecommunications tools is needed, but employment use is not the principal use. Implications 1.33 Employers can treat 25% of the amount paid either by reimbursement or by reimbursing allowance for usage plans and depreciation loss (if any) as exempt income of the employee. If employers pay 25% of the total usage charge as reimbursement or reimbursing allowance, then the whole amount will be exempt. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 1.34 If the employer pays a fixed amount per month, the employer could obtain a declaration from the employee that the employee’s costs are at least four times the amount of the reimbursing allowance paid. The whole amount paid by the employer is exempt. De Minimis Class – minimum payment treated as exempt income 1.35 The De Minimis Class allows for a payment of up to $5 per week, or up to $265 per year, per employee as reimbursement or reimbursing allowance for the cost of a usage plan to be treated as exempt income. No records necessary 1.36 It is not necessary to support this de minimis level of reimbursement or reimbursing allowance with records. Implications 1.37 Employers can treat a minor payment as exempt. Interpretation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. Unless the context otherwise requires: • • “business use” means use in connection with an employee’s employment or service; • • “depreciation loss” means an amount calculated under s CW 17(4). Depreciation loss is calculated using the Commissioner’s rates for the items and, if claimed, is counted as part of the $265 per year in relation to de minimis; • • “employee” does not include an independent contractor; • • “principally used” means the main or primary use; • • “reimbursing allowance” is an allowance paid by an employer for expenses that an employee incurs or is likely to incur in connection with their employment. A reimbursing allowance is not necessarily an exact reimbursement of expenditure and may involve an estimate; • • “required to use” means an obligation and a business reason to use; • • “telecommunications tools” includes, telephones, mobile phones, tablets, laptops and personal computers; • • “usage plans” means internet connection, service plans or usage plans in relation to telecommunications tools.

Susan Price Director, Public Rulings Commentary on public rulings BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement. The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06 (“the Rulings”). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. References to the CA 1993 are to the Companies Act 1993. Summary 1. The Rulings consider two situations. The situations represent two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the: • • rights are altered; and • • shares with altered rights are disposed of. 2. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 21 BINDING RULINGS 3. A basis sometimes put forward for shares with fundamentally altered rights being different property is the contractual doctrine of rescission. In the case of alterations provided for in the terms on which the shares were issued, the alteration would be pursuant to the original contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission would not apply. For the contractual doctrine of rescission to be relevant in other cases, there must be a contract. This makes the nature of a share, and whether share rights are conferred by contract, relevant in determining whether shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. It is also relevant to consider the rules in the Companies Act 1993 (CA 1993) for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights. 4. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons: • • The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. • • Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. • • When share rights alter, at no point does a shareholder lose control of their shares and have only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. • • Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 5. Accordingly, the alteration of rights attached to shares (share rights) does not result in a disposal of any shares for the purposes of s CB 4. The shares continue in existence with altered rights. The Commissioner considers that this will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 6. When a shareholder who acquired the shares on revenue account before the alteration disposes of the shares after the alteration, s CB 4 will apply to the disposal. This is because the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Therefore, the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. 7. While an alteration of share rights will not result in a disposal of a share, it may have an effect on shareholder continuity. 8. If a change in the rights attached to a share is effected by cancelling the old share and issuing a new share, there will be a disposal for the purposes of s CB 4 when the share is cancelled. Background 9. BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06 are reissues of BR Pub 17/04 and BR Pub 17/05, respectively. There are no changes to the Commissioner’s view of the application of s CB 4 to the Arrangement. Application of the legislation 10. Under s CB 4, an amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it: CB 4 Personal property acquired for purpose of disposal An amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. 11. Shares are a type of personal property: s 35 of the CA 1993. 12. Shares confer rights on shareholders: s 36(1) of the CA 1993. The rights can be altered by the constitution of the company, if any, or the terms on which the shares were issued: s 36(2) of the CA 1993. Altering share rights may be referred to as alterations, share reclassifications or share reorganisations. 13. Questions arise as to the application of s CB 4 where share rights alter and when a shareholder disposes of shares with altered rights. The Rulings consider two points in time at which s CB 4 could apply when share rights are altered, namely when the: • • rights are altered; • • shares with altered rights are disposed of. 14. Whether s CB 4 applies in these situations depends on whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 22 BINDING RULINGS Can the shares with altered rights be regarded as the same property as the shares before the alteration? 15. Two broad requirements of s CB 4 must be satisfied. If these requirements are met, an amount that the person derives from disposing of the personal property is income of the person. The first requirement is that a person acquires personal property for the purpose of disposing of it. The second requirement is that the person disposes of the personal property. 16. The grammatical construction of s CB 4 shows that the property disposed of must be the same property as that acquired. When share rights alter, the question arises whether the shares are the same property as the shares before the alteration. The answer to this question will also assist in determining the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights for the purposes of s CB 4. In determining whether the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, it is helpful to ask two questions: • • What is the nature of a share? • • Are shares disposed of when rights attached to them alter? What is the nature of a share? 17. Section 36(1) of the CA 1993 sets out the basic rights and powers that attach to shares. The basic rights and powers include the right for the shareholder to vote at a meeting of the company on any resolution, the right to an equal share in dividends authorised by the board, and the right to an equal share in the distribution of surplus assets of the company. The rights may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company, if there is one, or under the terms on which the shares were issued: s 36(2) of the CA 1993. 18. A company may issue different classes of shares: s 37(2) of the CA 1993. “Class” means a class of shares having identical rights, privileges, limitations and conditions attached to them: s 116(1) of the CA 1993. 19. It is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations between the shareholders and the company: Borland’s Trustee v Steel Brothers & Co Ltd \[1901\] 1 Ch 279; Bradbury v English Sewing Cotton Ltd \[1923\] AC 744 (HL); IRC v Laird Group plc \[2003\] UKHL 54. This was confirmed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Robertson v Bicknell \[2002\] BCL 408 (CA). In Robertson at \[23\], the Court also confirmed that the nature of the property in a share is the interest of a person in the company, that interest comprising various rights and obligations. 20. A shareholder does not have a proprietary right or interest in the assets of a company. A shareholder has been said to be entitled to a proportion of the company’s share capital, with reference to which the shareholder has certain rights: Archibald Howie v Commr of Stamp Duties (NSW) (1948) 77 CLR 143 at 156. 21. The property comprising a share encompasses all of the rights and obligations attached to the share. A shareholder does not own each share right as a separate piece of property: In re Alex Russell (deceased) \[1968\] VR 285 at 299. 22. Previously, under the Companies Act 1955 (CA 1955), the memorandum and articles of a company were deemed to be a contract between the company and its shareholders: s 34 of the CA 1955. However, the CA 1993 replaced the contractual model in the CA 1955: Maori Development Corp Ltd v Power Beat International Ltd \[1995\] 2 NZLR 568 (HC). The relationship between a company and its shareholders is now statutory: ss 31 and 38 of the CA 1993. 23. Obiter dicta in some cases decided under the CA 1993 suggest the relationship between a company and its shareholders remains a contractual one: Ord v Calan Healthcare Properties Ltd \[2004\] 2 NZLR 122 (HC); Todd Petroleum Mining Co Ltd v Shell (Petroleum Mining) Co Ltd (2005) 2 NZCCLR 266 (HC); Herzog v Hertli (HC Blenheim CIV-2007-406-251, 23 March 2009); Manak v Hutt & City Taxis Ltd \[2009\] NZCCLR 36 (HC). However, in Maori Development Corp, s 31 of the CA 1993 was specifically referred to and considered. Blanchard J said, at 574, that the contractual model in the CA 1955 had been replaced by the statutory statement in s 31 of the CA 1993. 24. Blanchard J’s view is supported by statements made by the New Zealand Law Commission on the form and content of a new Companies Act in Company Law Reform and Restatement (NZLC R9, New Zealand Law Commission, Wellington, June 1989). In that report, at 1, the Commission said that one of the most significant proposed reforms was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. The Commission said, at 19, that “\[t\]he standard constitution, and any modification of it, should confer rights directly and not, as the \[CA 1955\] provides, by deeming the constitutional documents to be a contract”. Also, the Explanatory Note to the Companies Bill introduced on 21 September 1990 stated, at ii, that a purpose of the Bill was to redefine “the distribution of power within the company by direct operation of statute rather than by a deemed contract”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 23 BINDING RULINGS 25. The change from the contractual model of the CA 1955 is important. This is because under the contractual model, fundamentally altering the share rights may have amounted to rescission of a contract and the entering into of a new one and, by implication, a cancellation of the shares and the issue of new ones. This would not have been the case, though, if the alteration arose from the terms of the shares themselves or the articles of association of the company (or constitution in the case of the CA 1993). However, given the statutory basis of shares under the CA 1993, the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. Whether the shares are cancelled and new ones are issued depends on the operation of the CA 1993 and the company’s constitution, if any. 26. The Commissioner considers that the relationship between a company and its shareholders is statutory. The Commissioner has previously considered the nature of shares: “Public Rulings BR Pub 16/05: Income tax – Treatment of a subdivision of shares under section CB 4 and BR Pub 16/06: Income tax – Treatment of a disposal of subdivided shares under s CB 4”, Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 3-5. The Commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 states that it is generally accepted that a share is a bundle of rights and obligations conferred under a contract between the shareholders and the company. To the extent that the Commentary on BR Pub 16/05 and BR Pub 16/06 suggests the relationship between a company and its shareholders is contractual, it is incorrect. The Commentary to these Public Rulings (BR Pub 19/05 and BR Pub 19/06) should be relied on as setting out the Commissioner’s view on the nature of a share and the relationship between a company and its shareholders. Are shares disposed of when the rights attached to them alter? 27. “Dispose” is not defined in s YA 1 for the purposes of s CB 4 (it is defined for the purposes of other sections in the Act, but these definitions do not assist in this inquiry). The courts have held that, speaking generally, “disposed of ” covers all forms of alienation and carries connotations of sale, assignment, or transfer of the property: FCT v Wade (1951) 84 CLR 105; Lyttelton Port Co Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,556 (HC). “Disposition” has been said to mean “a ridding oneself of the right or interest”: Coles Myer Ltd v Commr of State Revenue (Vic) 98 ATC 4537 (VSCA) at 4,546. As a result, the Commissioner considers that “disposing” of property must involve the alienation or ridding of that property by the disposer. 28. If there is a cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter, then that would indicate that shares have been disposed of and that the shares with altered rights are different property from the shares before the alteration. 29. The CA 1993 provides comprehensive rules for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights. 30. Section 36(2) of the CA 1993 provides that the rights and powers attached to shares may be negated, altered or added to by the constitution of the company or in accordance with the terms on which the shares were issued. A company is not required to have a constitution, although it may adopt one by special resolution: ss 26 and 32 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the company, its board and each of its directors and shareholders have the rights, powers, duties and obligations set out in the CA 1993: s 28 of the CA 1993. If a company does not have a constitution, the rights attached to its shares can be altered only in accordance with the terms on which the shares were issued. 31. Sections 117 and 118 of the CA 1993 provide certain rules regarding the alteration of shareholder rights. Section 117(1) of the CA 1993 provides that a company must not take action that affects share rights unless that action has been approved by shareholders whose rights are affected. Section 118 of the CA 1993 gives dissenting shareholders the right to require the company to purchase their shares. 32. The issue of shares is dealt with in ss 41–51 of the CA 1993. The issue of shares has been described as the whole process whereby unissued shares are applied for, allotted and, finally, registered: National Westminster Bank plc v IRC \[1994\] 3 All ER 1 (HL). Section 42 of the CA 1993 provides that, subject to the CA 1993 and the constitution of the company, if any, a company may issue shares at any time, to any person and in any number it thinks fit. On the face of it, this is a very broad power. However, the right to issue shares is subject to requirements in other provisions of the CA 1993, such as the registration of notice of a share issue and the obtaining of shareholder approval in certain circumstances: ss 43 and 44 of the CA 1993. Section 107(2) of the CA 1993 provides that shares may be issued otherwise than in accordance with some of these requirements, if all entitled persons agree or concur. Section 51 provides that a share is issued when the name of the holder is entered on the share register. 33. Sections 58–67 of the CA 1993 deal with the acquisition by a company of its own shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 59 provides that a company may acquire its own shares if permitted by its constitution, if any. Generally, any shares so acquired are deemed to be cancelled immediately on acquisition: s 66 of the CA 1993. A company must comply with procedural requirements when acquiring its own shares, such as meeting a solvency test and registration of a notice of the acquisition: ss 58 and 59 of the CA 1993. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 24 BINDING RULINGS 34. Sections 68–75 of the CA 1993 deal with the redemption of shares and their deemed cancellation. Section 68 provides that shares are redeemable if: • • the constitution of the company makes provision for the issue of redeemable shares, and • • the constitution or the terms of issue of the shares makes provision for the redemption of the shares for a consideration that is specified or calculated by a formula or suitably qualified person. 35. Shares that a company redeems are deemed to be cancelled immediately on redemption: s 73 of the CA 1993. A company must comply with procedural requirements when redeeming shares, such as board resolutions and meeting a solvency test in certain circumstances: ss 69 and 70 of the CA 1993. 36. The separate rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares, and the altering of share rights, make it seem unlikely that an alteration of share rights by the company’s constitution, if any, or the terms on which the shares are issued will involve the cancellation and issue of shares by implication. 37. Further, s 83 of the CA 1993 provides for a statement of rights to be given to shareholders, on request. Section 83(2) provides that the company does not have to provide a shareholder with such a statement in certain circumstances, including if a statement has been provided within the previous six months and: • • the shareholder has not acquired or disposed of shares since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(b) of the CA 1993); and • • the rights attached to shares of the company have not been altered since the previous statement was provided (s 83(2)(c) of the CA 1993). 38. The relevance of s 83(2) of the CA 1993 is the distinction that Parliament has drawn between the acquisition of shares and the alteration of share rights. It is apparent from s 83(2) of the CA 1993 that Parliament regarded the acquisition of shares and the alteration to share rights as different things. 39. Based on the rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, the Commissioner considers that there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. This will be the case whether there is a minor change, or a complete change of class. 40. There are other indications that shares are not disposed of when share rights alter. One such indication is that when share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. 41. Another is that altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company: Robertson v FCT (1952) 86 CLR 463. Conclusion 42. The Commissioner considers that shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration for the purposes of s CB 4 for four reasons: • • The rights and obligations comprising a share are not conferred by contract, so the contractual doctrine of rescission is not relevant. • • Based on the separate rules in the CA 1993 for the issue and cancellation of shares and the altering of share rights, there is no cancellation and issue of shares by implication when share rights alter. • • When share rights alter there is no point at which a shareholder loses control of their shares and has only a right to receive shares, such as may be the case when shares are cancelled and new shares are issued. • • Altering share rights does not involve property moving from the company to the shareholders. The alteration merely alters the shareholders’ existing rights against the company. 43. This conclusion is consistent with Interpretation Statement “Available subscribed capital – Consequences of deemed reregistration”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 7 (July 1998): 8, which considers the consequences of share reclassifications on available subscribed capital. 44. While the altered shares will be the same property, it is noted that any change to the “voting rights” (defined in s YC 2) attached to shares may affect shareholder continuity for the purposes of determining whether losses and imputation credits can be carried forward. It is also noted that s GB 34 (ICA arrangements for carrying amounts forward) may apply in some circumstances if voting rights are altered. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 25 BINDING RULINGS Does s CB 4 apply at the time share rights are altered? 45. When share rights alter, the Commissioner considers that the shareholder does not alienate, rid themselves of, or otherwise lose control of their shares. Shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. Given this, the Commissioner considers s CB 4 does not apply at the time share rights are altered. Does s CB 4 apply at the time shares with altered rights are disposed of? 46. An amount derived by a person on the disposal of shares with altered rights, where the shares were acquired before the alteration for the purpose of disposal, will be income of the person under s CB 4. Conversely, s CB 4 will not apply to an amount derived by a person on the disposal of the shares where the shares were not acquired before the alteration for the purpose of disposal. This is because the shares held by the person after the rights attached to the shares have been altered are the same property as the shares held by the person before the alteration. What is the time of acquisition for shares with altered rights held on revenue account? 47. Given that the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration, the Commissioner considers that the time of acquisition of the shares with altered rights is the time the shares were acquired before the alteration. Examples 48. The following examples are included to help explain the application of the law. Example 1 — shares acquired for the purpose of disposal 49. On 15 May 2018, Shani purchased 1,000 shares in Red Packaging Ltd (RPL) for $10 per share. Shani acquired the shares for the purpose of disposing of them. Therefore, Shani holds these shares on revenue account. 50. The directors of RPL decide to create a new class of share with preferential rights to dividends and limited voting rights. The rights attached to half of RPL’s issued shares will be altered to create the new class of share. Five hundred of Shani’s shares will have their rights altered and become part of the new class of shares. The alteration has been approved by interested shareholders. 51. The alteration occurs on 30 July 2019. Shani’s shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply at this time because Shani has not disposed of anything. 52. On 15 August 2019, Shani sells all of her shares in RPL for $15,000. At this point, the requirements of s CB 4 have been met. Shani has derived an amount from the disposal of property that she acquired for the purpose of disposal. As a result, Shani will have derived income of $15,000 on the sale of the shares. She will be allowed a deduction of $10,000 under s DB 23 for the cost of the shares in RPL, this being the amount she incurred when the shares were acquired on 15 May 2019. Example 2 — shares not acquired for purpose of disposal 53. On 10 April 2018, Blue Ltd purchased 100 shares in Orange Transport Ltd (OTL) as a long-term investment. The shares carry preferential rights to dividends and have limited voting rights. The directors of OTL proposed that the rights attached to the shares be altered on 1 June 2019 so as to attract ordinary rights to dividends and full voting rights. Blue Ltd is among the majority of shareholders who vote in favour of the alteration. The shares are not formally cancelled or redeemed; nor are any new shares issued. Section CB 4 will not apply on 1 June 2019 when the share rights alter because Blue Ltd has not disposed of anything. 54. On 1 October 2019, due to a change in investment strategy, Blue Ltd decides to sell its shares in OTL. Section CB 4 will not apply to the amount that Blue Ltd derives on the disposal of its shares in OTL. This is because, even though Blue Ltd voted in favour of the alteration to share rights, the shares with altered rights are the same property as the shares before the alteration. When Blue Ltd acquired the shares on 10 April 2018, it did not have a purpose of disposing of them.

These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 19/04: Income tax – distributions from foreign trusts All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in Appendix B to this Interpretation Statement. Scope of this statement 1. This Interpretation Statement considers the income tax treatment of amounts of money or property transferred to New Zealand resident taxpayers by a person overseas, including through inheritance. It addresses how to determine whether the person who transfers the money or property is a trustee of a trust and when a taxpayer will have derived either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. Key terms 2. This item discusses issues using several terms that may be unfamiliar to some readers. The following brief glossary is intended to assist by describing a few of these terms in a general way: Administrators are appointed by the court to administer an estate. Assent describes what occurs at the point of administration of an estate when, either expressly or by implication, personal representatives accept that estate property can be distributed or should be held on trust. Bare trust is a trust where the trustee has no duties to perform (aside from guarding the property) beyond transferring trust property to a beneficiary when required to do so. A bare trust is treated in the same way as a nominee for tax purposes. Beneficiary income is income derived by a trustee but vested in or paid to a beneficiary in the same year or soon after. Civil law countries have legal systems based on Roman civil law or law other than English law. Common law countries are countries where the legal system is based on English law rather than Roman civil law or other law. Corpus is the value (at the time of settlement) of property settled on a trust. Executors are appointed by a testator (a person who makes a will) to carry out the instructions in the will. Foreign trust means a trust that has had no New Zealand resident settlor. Non-discretionary trust is a trust where trustees have no discretion as to various matters for distributions to beneficiaries. Ordering rules are the rules in s HC 16 that specify what various elements of a distribution are to be treated as consisting of and in what order. Personal representatives are executors or administrators. Settlor is someone who transfers value to a trustee. Taxable distributions are transfers of value to beneficiaries by trustees of foreign and non-complying trusts other than of things listed in s HC 15 (such as beneficiary income and corpus). Tr u s t is not a description of an entity but a description of an obligation on someone to hold property for beneficiaries or objects (as discussed in this item). Trustee income is income derived by a trustee that is not beneficiary income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 28 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Summary 3. New Zealand residents are generally liable to income tax on income derived from sources in New Zealand and worldwide. Their assessable income includes money or property transferred to them by someone offshore as “beneficiary income” or a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. 4. Both concepts require that the money or property comes from a “trust” as that term is interpreted for New Zealand tax law purposes. It follows that the person transferring must have held the money or property according to arrangements where the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law are present. The money or property must have been held by the person as trust property with an equitable obligation to deal with it for the benefit of a person or charitable object. Whether such an obligation exists turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that would be within the concept of a trust were the issue to be decided under New Zealand law. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then there is a trust. This is the case whether the law of another country would recognise the situation as a trust or not and whether the trust law of another country is the same as trust law here or not (see \[30\]-\[32\]). 5. Where a trust exists (unless it is a “bare” trust – see \[188\] to \[195\] below), a distribution from it will be “beneficiary income” if it is current year income derived by trustees but paid to a beneficiary in the income year (or within the extended time period provided by s HC 6(1B)). 6. For an amount that is not beneficiary income to be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”, the trust must have had no New Zealand settlor and the transfer must amount to a “taxable distribution”. 7. A transfer to a person as beneficiary of a foreign trust is a taxable distribution (unless it is current year income) if it is not within an exception in s HC 15(4) (such as for corpus and certain capital gains). However, the ordering rules in s HC 16 (see \[143\]) may apply and may override what would normally be the character of components of the distribution based on the terms of the trust or the description given of the distribution by the trust. To apply the ordering rules, good financial records for the trust are required, and the onus will be on the beneficiary to obtain that information. 8. An important exception to the requirement to apply the ordering rules is for distributions from non-discretionary trusts created by will or arising after intestacy (see \[145\]). 9. Where the money or property transferred to a resident is an inheritance, it may be subject to tax if a foreign trust arises following administration of the deceased’s estate. This is unlikely to be the case (although it is possible) where the deceased was in a country that does not have the concept of a trust as part of its law. Where an inheritance does not come from a trust, there can still be New Zealand tax consequences for income that may be treated as derived by the inheritor from date of death because the law in the country concerned provides for immediate succession on death. 10. For estate administration in countries with legal systems like New Zealand’s, once personal representatives have ascertained the property available for distribution (residue), they either transfer it to beneficiaries or they vest it in someone acting in the capacity of trustee. Until they have assented to such transfer or vesting, the personal representatives have the legal and beneficial interests in the property comprising the estate and any trust provided for in the terms of a will (a testamentary trust) or under the rules governing an intestacy will not arise. 11. Where executors are also sole trustees of a testamentary trust, the residue (or part of it) will vest in themselves following assent and they will hold it on trust and in their capacity as trustees. Where separate trustees are named, the equitable interest in the property vests following assent but executors must do what is necessary to transfer legal title to the trustees. 12. A bare trust may mark the interval between assent and any beneficiary under the will taking legal title. Where a trust following assent is a bare trust, there is effectively no trust for tax purposes. 13. In contrast, testamentary trusts can take the form of express trusts, life interests and minority interests (see \[41\]-\[43\]) and will not be bare trusts. 14. When a trust arises from a deceased estate offshore, as for other foreign trusts outside the context of deceased estates, amounts subsequently distributed to beneficiaries in New Zealand may be beneficiary income or taxable distributions. Such amounts derived by an individual will not have income tax deducted at source and so will not be “reportable income” included as pre-populated income information for the automatically calculated assessments made and included in the individual’s tax return each year. It will need to be included separately as “other income” in the individual’s tax return. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 29 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Introduction 15. In general terms, under New Zealand’s approach to taxation, residents are taxable on their worldwide income, and non- residents are taxed on New Zealand-sourced income: s BD 1(5). 16. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign trusts are income of a New Zealand tax resident. Determining whether money or property transferred to a resident is subject to tax as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution is often not simple. It requires consideration of all the circumstances of the transfer to the resident and the possible application of rules (ordering rules) that can override what might appear otherwise to be the nature of the transfer. 17. Thought should be given to the possibility of income from a trust being derived whenever money or property has been transferred to a New Zealand tax resident by someone who is a non-resident. Trust income can arise wherever in the world the money or property may be situated and in a wide variety of trust arrangements. For example, taxable amounts might be received from a trust established by a relative who has never had any connection to New Zealand, or they might come from a trust settled offshore before a resident migrated to New Zealand. Trust income may arise when it is not immediately obvious that an amount has come from a trust. 18. Sometimes the result can be tax on distributions of assets from the overseas estate of a deceased person to a beneficiary of the estate. It does not necessarily follow from money or property being inherited and received from someone overseas that there is no tax liability. It also makes no difference that something might be described as a “gift” or a “bequest”. 19. Whether an amount is taxable can be difficult to determine and may depend on information that is hard for taxpayers to obtain. The tax treatment of amounts can depend on activity by the trustees since the trust began, and inadequate records of this activity can have the consequence of a distribution being treated as taxable (s HC 15(7) – see \[147\]). Further, the introduction of Common Reporting Standard and Automatic Exchange of Information arrangements means Inland Revenue is likely to have more information than it had in the past about amounts that are transferred to New Zealand tax residents from offshore trusts. The Commissioner, therefore, considers the guidance in this Interpretation Statement will be both useful and timely. 20. Note that this Interpretation Statement is not specifically concerned with trusts that might be affected by the foreign trust registration and disclosure requirements introduced early in 2017 (s 59B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s HC 26 of the Income Tax Act are the main provisions), which are often referred to as “New Zealand foreign trusts”. They are a subset of foreign trusts that have a non-resident settlor, have at least one New Zealand resident trustee and enjoy an exemption from tax on foreign-sourced trustee income under s HC 26. The connection to New Zealand of most of this subset of trusts is simply having trustees here, so few are likely to make distributions to New Zealand residents. However, a distribution by such a trust to a New Zealand resident is covered by the discussion in this Interpretation Statement. Discussion Taxing beneficiary income and taxable distributions 21. This Interpretation Statement concerns the tax rules that apply when a New Zealand tax resident inherits or receives a distribution of money or property from someone overseas. 22. The money or property may be in New Zealand or in another country but if the transfer of money or property is from a trust, a potential tax liability arises for the New Zealand resident. 23. The tax rules applicable are discussed in more detail in Appendix A, but the tax liability will arise because the resident derives income in the form of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. 24. Whether amounts are beneficiary income or taxable distributions depends on establishing whether the money or property comes from a trust. Whether an arrangement is a “trust” 25. It will not always be clear that money or property is transferred from a trust. 26. Often, there will be a trust deed and an acknowledgement by the person who transfers property that they are transferring as a trustee. This acknowledgment will usually indicate the existence of a trust and the making of a distribution by a trust. 27. However, there may be circumstances creating doubt that the transfer is from a “trust”. For instance, some countries (such as civil law jurisdictions like France and Germany) do not have the legal concept of a trust. Also, some countries do not have the same laws concerning the establishment and validity of trusts or the administration of estates as we have in New Zealand. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 30 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 28. Situations like this make it important to understand what is meant by the word “trust”. 29. Where the issue is whether money or property transferred to New Zealand residents by trusts should be treated as income, the starting point will be the application of the trust rules in the tax legislation. These rules apply where a “trust” exists. The question is the interpretation to be given to the word “trust” in the legislation. 30. For reasons set out in more detail in Appendix A (see \[101\]-\[134\]), it is considered that the word “trust” in tax law has the meaning that it has under New Zealand general law. This meaning is that a trust is not an entity but a description of an equitable obligation the law imposes on a person holding property to deal with that property in a certain way; namely, for the benefit of beneficiaries or a charitable purpose. Circumstances will be found to give rise to a trust only where there is such a person (the trustee(s)), property that can be the subject of the trust, someone (one or more beneficiaries) for whose benefit the property is held and where the law imposes the required obligation. It is an objective exercise to determine whether a trust exists and a court is likely to take account of the provisions of the Trusts Act 2019 which is intended to align with common law and equity while not being a code. 31. Money or property transferred to a New Zealand resident will, therefore, come from a trust when there exists an arrangement, the true nature of which is that the person transferring had a fiduciary obligation to hold property for the benefit of a person or an object. Whether such an obligation exists, turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that has the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law; namely that a person (trustee) holds trust property and has an equitable obligation to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a charitable purpose. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then a trust exists for tax legislation purposes. 32. Under the laws of countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, what amounts to a trust is very similar to the position in New Zealand. However, a trust may exist whether the law of another country would recognise the arrangement as a trust or not and whether the trust law of another country is the same as trust law here or not. The law of trusts varies between countries, so where the circumstances are such that they would give rise to a trust that is valid in another country under that country’s law but that arrangement would not be a trust under New Zealand law, the trust rules will not apply. It is also possible that an arrangement may be considered a trust for New Zealand tax purposes and not be considered a trust under the laws of another country. This may be the case despite the concept of trusts not even being part of the law of such a country, as is the case for civil law countries. Deceased estates – when an inheritance will be a distribution from a trust 33. A New Zealand resident inheriting money or property on the death of someone overseas will often not have a tax liability for having derived beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a trust. There may be several reasons for this. 34. First, no part of an inheritance may be a distribution from a trust because the administration of the estate does not give rise to a trust that includes the money or property in question. Or, secondly, as discussed from \[190\], money or property often ends up being held on a “bare trust” that will not be recognised as a trust for tax purposes. In that situation, income generated by the property while held on bare trust will be treated as income of the beneficiary, but the transfer of the property itself will not give rise to a tax liability under the trust rules. 35. Further, and even if the inheritance is received from a trust arising in the administration of a deceased estate, it may not be a taxable distribution when the trust rules are applied. Perhaps the ordering rules do not apply or, if they do apply, the ordering rules do not require the distribution to be treated as taxable. 36. However, an express trust may be provided for in a will or contingencies may give rise to a trust in some circumstances. Such a trust arising in the administration of the estate of a deceased person overseas means a possible tax liability for a person receiving a distribution. 37. A trust arising in the administration of an estate is a trust that the trust rules apply to in the same way as any other trust. It follows that when a New Zealand tax resident receives or becomes entitled to money or property from an executor or administrator (personal representative) of a non-resident deceased person’s estate, an important question is whether the personal representative is distributing as a trustee of a trust. 38. Just as when any property is transferred by someone overseas to someone in New Zealand, it is important to identify whether the circumstances are such that the estate property is held on a trust, whether this is a foreign trust and whether the distribution is a taxable distribution or beneficiary income. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 31 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 39. As to whether the estate is held on trust, that will be when the legal basis on which what is distributed is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations. 40. In the context of deceased estates, whether a trust exists will turn on the basis on which the personal representatives in question hold the estate and make the distribution. Estate administration laws can determine that basis, so whether circumstances exist that they would give rise to a trust under New Zealand law will depend to some extent on what the estate administration laws of the other country are. 41. In New Zealand, on a person’s death, personal representatives acting in that capacity have the legal and beneficial interest in the estate property and do not hold the estate on trust for heirs. For reasons discussed in Appendix A (see from \[155\]), in New Zealand a trust arises in the administration of an estate only once the personal representatives have given “assent” in relation to the property. An equitable obligation amounting to a trust, therefore, arises only following assent by the personal representatives to the property in question being held on trust by a trustee or trustees. Such assent can be express or inferred from the circumstances. 42. Even then, unless distributions are from trusts expressly provided for in a will, they may be by personal representatives holding on a “bare trust” (discussed from \[190\]) and will not be taxable distributions for that reason. 43. Common law countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada are likely to have similar estate administration laws to those in New Zealand. Trusts are, therefore, also not likely to arise until assent of personal representatives where an estate is administered in those countries. In situations such as heirs not being of age or a will providing for a life interest before distribution of property to heirs, where delays in distribution follow assent by personal representatives and property is not held on a bare trust, subsequent transfer to beneficiaries in New Zealand may be a taxable distribution. 44. Uncertainty around when the role of a personal representative becomes the role of a trustee will make the tax law difficult to apply in many situations. When a trust arises depends on the time of assent. That may not be easy to determine because there is no requirement (or general practice) to formally and expressly assent. It will often be a matter of inference from the circumstances. Once assent has occurred, estate property that continues to be held undistributed will be held on trust, with potential tax consequences if the trust is not a bare trust (see from \[196\]). 45. Distributions from estates of residents of civil law countries such as France, Germany and Switzerland are less likely to be from trusts. The general position in such countries is that heirs directly succeed to property on death and have a legal interest from that time. Personal representatives do not distribute anything to heirs that they do not already own. That does not mean the heirs can have no tax liability, they can still have New Zealand tax to pay on any income derived from their share of the estate. For example, interest from loans or rent from rental properties would be derived by the heirs as owners from the date of death. This may raise compliance (plus interest and possible penalty) issues in practice as heirs may not be aware of the details of their income until much later. Also, possible application of double tax agreements and foreign tax credits would be relevant to calculation of the tax liability. However, distributions will not be beneficiary income or taxable distributions from a trust unless the circumstances otherwise give rise to a trust. 46. In summary, a New Zealand tax resident will not derive anything that will be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust unless: • • for common law countries, administration of an estate has at least reached the stage that personal representatives have assented to the property being held on trust; or • • for civil law countries, something has happened to the property before transfer to the resident that New Zealand law would consider gives rise to a trust (for instance, the property was transferred to someone in another country (a common law country) to hold on trust for the resident in New Zealand - a distribution made direct to the resident would not be a distribution from a trust). Examples 47. The following seven examples help to explain the application of the law. Some of the discussion is based on the analysis covered in Appendix A, which follows the examples. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 32 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 1: Whether there is a trust – United States “trustee” sends money to New Zealand tax resident 48. Adam is a wealthy United States (US) citizen. Five years ago, he set up a “living trust”, a common estate planning method in the US. He appointed himself trustee, and the trust deed recorded that the trust was revocable during his lifetime but would become irrevocable on his death. Until then, income from the property, if distributed, must be paid to him and nobody else. The property must be held in the trust, but he is able to have it transferred to him if he chooses or to any other person. Further, one provision in the trust deed allows Adam to absolve himself as trustee from any breaches of trust. 49. As trustee, and without breaching the income distribution clause, he sends some money to his son Orson who lives in New Zealand. The money is intended to be used by Orson to set up a business here. Orson wonders if the money is taxable in New Zealand. 50. Orson is a New Zealand tax resident, and there has been a transfer of value to him. However, he would, arguably, not derive a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. This is because the money may not have come from a trust. While Orson’s father’s revocable trust is a valid trust for the purposes of US law (although looked through for US tax purposes), the law of New Zealand would not necessarily recognise it as a valid trust. While Adam is alive, the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law are not present. This is not because the arrangement is “revocable” by Adam. Under New Zealand law, a valid trust can include one that may be brought to an end at any time. Instead, the important consideration on these facts is that, as trustee, Adam can effectively make a final distribution of all property held, he cannot effectively be called to account, and he did not intend to create a trust that would divest himself of the property in his lifetime. 51. The amount Orson received would be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as a gift, from his father in the US, from amounts that would have previously been taxed in the US to his father, if they were taxable there. Nothing in the facts suggests the amount is of an income character and subject to New Zealand tax in Orson’s hands. Example 2: Whether there is a trust – property held in Switzerland transferred to New Zealand tax resident 52. Carl has lived in Switzerland all his life and has accumulated several properties that he decides to dispose of. One is an apartment in Zurich that he wants to keep in the family, so he transfers it to his brother Roger and they sign an agreement that Roger is responsible for maintaining it and meeting outgoings and can live in it or rent it out in the meantime but would transfer the apartment and any accumulated rental income to Carl’s daughter Ursula when she turns 25. In the event of Ursula dying before she turns 25, Roger is to give the apartment and accumulated rental income to his own children. 53. Ursula moves to New Zealand as a 20-year-old. Five years later (after she has lost her transitional tax resident status), and on the day she turns 25, Roger transfers title in the apartment to her. He received rental income on the apartment for three years, so he deposits that in her bank account in New Zealand. 54. The tax treatment of this for Ursula will depend on whether the arrangement between Carl and Roger has the essential features of a trust under the law of trusts in New Zealand. The full factual details would be needed to decide, but at first sight the obligations that Roger is under appear to be obligations that would be regarded in New Zealand as fiduciary in nature and there would be a trust under New Zealand general law, despite the arrangement being likely to be considered a contract under Swiss law. 55. Assuming the arrangement is a trust for New Zealand tax purposes, the ordering rules in s HC 16 would apply because although it is likely to be a non-discretionary trust, it was not created by will or on intestacy. Roger has kept very good records of his time owning the apartment, so the ordering rules would treat any current year rental income as beneficiary income (because it is income derived by the trustee and paid to Ursula), the apartment itself as corpus or capital gains (and so excluded by s HC 15(4) from being a taxable distribution) and the accumulated rental income as a taxable distribution (being income Roger, as trustee, derived in earlier income years). 56. Tax credits are potentially available for tax paid by Roger (if paid by deduction ie at source and not if paid by Roger as legal owner) in Switzerland to reduce Ursula’s tax liability on current year income. Art 22(1) of the double tax agreement (DTA) with Switzerland would seem to permit a credit for Swiss tax paid by deduction or by Ursula against New Zealand tax payable on the rental income distributed as beneficiary income or derived after title is transferred to her. The mechanism is via the domestic provisions such as ss LJ 1 and LJ 2. There is however no express recognition of fiscally transparent vehicles in the DTA with Switzerland so if Roger was assessed for Swiss tax then arguably it would not be treated as Ursula’s tax liability under that DTA. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 33 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 57. No tax credits would be available for tax paid on Roger’s accumulation of rental income for previous years as a trustee. This would be treated as a taxable distribution if distributed in a lump sum to Ursula after her transitional resident status had ended. Under s LJ 6 only any tax equivalent to Non-Resident Withholding Tax deducted in Switzerland from a taxable distribution would be available as a credit in New Zealand. 58. If the arrangement is not a trust, the transfer of the apartment and any rental income accumulated by Roger before Ursula turned 25 would likely not be treated as income in New Zealand. These two items would essentially be treated in the same manner as gifts. Because the facts do not suggest Roger is an agent for Ursula at any stage, current year rental income derived before Ursula was 25 would also not be taxable in New Zealand. Example 3: Ordering rules 59. In 2008, Charles, a celebrity chef, and Joanna, a successful banker, in the City of London, settle an investment portfolio and a house in the Cotswolds on a trust for their two children, Mary and Elizabeth. 60. In 2010, Mary moves to Australia. In 2012, Elizabeth moves to New Zealand, becoming resident here. Using the discretion given in the trust deed for the trust, in 2018 the trustees transfer the portfolio and accumulated income to Mary in Australia and the house to Elizabeth in New Zealand. 61. Although it is a discretionary trust, the trust is not a testamentary trust or created on intestacy so the tax treatment of the distribution for Elizabeth in New Zealand is going to depend on the application of the ordering rules in s HC 16. This means that Elizabeth will not be able to treat the distribution of the house to her as all being corpus and capital gains but must take account of the components of the investment portfolio. A proportion of the accumulated income in the portfolio would need to be treated under s HC 16(2) as income that the trustee derived and would be a taxable distribution under s HC 15(4). 62. For how the proportion should be calculated, see examples 21–23 and associated commentary in Interpretation Statement IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (IS 18/01, Inland Revenue 2018). Example 4: Overseas will trusts 63. David moved to New Zealand from Australia with his mother when he was 12. His parents had separated, and David was their only child. David’s father Joe was killed in a mining accident when David was 18. Joe’s will left David a specific legacy of a sum of money and a direction that a trust be created with the balance of his residuary estate (mostly comprising commercial properties in Perth) to be held by the trustee, accumulating rents and reinvesting until David turned 21. 64. David has now turned 21, and the trustee has sold the properties and sent everything to David in New Zealand. 65. Assuming the law of administration of estates in Australia not to be materially different to the law in New Zealand, the only tax implications for David when he receives the specific legacy will arise from the fact that the money in question effectively moved from Joe to David at the time of Joe’s death (under the “relation back” principle). If Joe invested the money in Australia before sending it to David, income may have been derived that would be taxable to David in New Zealand. If not, it could be argued a bare trust briefly existed with the executors’ assent inferred. However, the transfer of the specific legacy will not be recognised as a trust distribution for New Zealand tax purposes. 66. The distribution from the testamentary trust created from the residuary estate, on the other hand, is likely to have tax implications for David under the trust rules. Current year investment income of the trustee distributed to David will be beneficiary income. The trust will be a foreign trust because Joe has never lived in New Zealand and he is the only person who has ever settled anything on the trust. The ordering rules in s HC 16 do not apply, assuming the trust meets the requirements to be a non-discretionary trust. Therefore, the income treatment will be determined by the relevant deed or the trustees’ determination. Accumulated rental and investment returns will be a taxable distribution, but the proceeds of sale of the properties will not, being excluded under s HC 15(4) as either corpus or capital gains. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 34 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Example 5: Deceased in a civil law country 67. Thomas has lived in Germany for most of his life. His only son Joseph moved to New Zealand in 2005. When his wife died in 2010, Thomas made a will leaving all his property to Joseph. 68. When Thomas passes away in 2016, Joseph travels to Germany and discusses Thomas’s estate with the executor, Erich, a professional financial advisor in Berlin. Erich suggests it would be consistent with Thomas’s wishes that Joseph does not take the inheritance to New Zealand straight away but keeps it overseas. Erich’s advice is to appoint a company in the Cayman Islands to hold the estate on trust for Joseph’s family until the trustee determines they need it. 69. Circumstances change and five years later Joseph’s family is now short of money. The trust is wound up and everything is distributed to Joseph and his wife. 70. The tax effects of this for Joseph and his wife are very likely to be that they have derived beneficiary income and taxable distributions. Joseph may also not have been aware that, as a New Zealand resident settlor, he had an obligation to meet the trustee company’s New Zealand tax obligations on trustee income (s HC 25) and to disclose under s 59(1) of the TAA the particulars of the trust. Further, amounts distributed that are taxable distributions will not be from a foreign trust, instead they are likely to be from a non-complying trust, meaning a greater tax liability for them. Although Joseph inherited the estate from a deceased person in Germany, a civil law country without trusts and where Joseph directly succeeded to the estate on Thomas’s death, Joseph then settled on the Cayman Islands trust assets that had vested in him before the settlement. Joseph is a New Zealand tax resident, so the trust would be a non-complying trust and not a foreign trust (although an election to be a complying trust may be possible – see \[8.33\] of IS 18/01 and proposed amendments to s HC 33 in the Taxation (Kiwisaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill 2019). The same outcomes could be expected if Joseph had inherited the estate from a deceased person from a common law country. Example 6: Non-discretionary will trust 71. Cindy moves to New Zealand in 2005 from Canada. Her parents die in a car accident in 2012 leaving wills under which their executors are instructed to establish a non-discretionary trust to hold their estate for their seven children, six of whom have remained living in Canada. 72. In 2018, Cindy receives a substantial payment from the trustees following the sale of some Canadian shares that were part of the estate at the time of her parents’ death. The trustees sign a formal resolution to the effect that the proceeds of sale should be distributed to the beneficiaries. 73. Because it is a non-discretionary will trust, the ordering rules in s HC 16 do not apply, and the trustee resolution will determine the tax effect for Cindy. This means there is no taxable distribution to Cindy because the proceeds will be both corpus of the trusts established under the parents’ wills and profits from realisation of capital assets (assuming the shares had increased in value since they were settled on the trusts). Example 7: Discretionary will trust – ordering rules and the importance of records 74. As in Example 6, Cindy’s parents die and leave wills, but this time the executors are instructed to establish discretionary trusts. 75. In 2018, Cindy asks the trustees for funds to support her daughter who is about to go to university. The trustees decide to sell some of the New Zealand shares and distribute the proceeds to Cindy. They sign a formal resolution to this effect. 76. In this case, the result of the application of the ordering rules in s HC 16(2) may be that Cindy has received a taxable distribution. For this not to be the case, the records of the trust would need to show that there had been no income derived by the trustees in the current or earlier years that had not been distributed to beneficiaries earlier or at the same time. This is despite the distribution by the trustees being intended to be of corpus and capital gains. 77. Further, if Cindy cannot obtain adequate records to be able to determine the elements of the distribution under s HC 16(2), s HC 15(7) will apply to treat the entire distribution to her as a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 35 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Appendix A – Detailed analysis of applicable tax rules for distributions from foreign trusts 78. This appendix contains detailed analysis about the tax rules that apply when a New Zealand tax resident inherits or receives a distribution of money or property from someone overseas. A tax liability will arise because the resident derives income in the form of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. Whether amounts are beneficiary income or taxable distributions depends on establishing whether the money or property comes from a trust. 79. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in Appendix B. Tax for New Zealand residents generally 80. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with the tax rules that apply to a New Zealand tax resident. The Commissioner’s views on the test for whether somebody is tax resident in New Zealand are set out in Interpretation Statement IS 16/03: Tax Residence (IS 16/03, Inland Revenue, 2016). 81. A tax resident of New Zealand is generally liable to income tax in New Zealand on income derived from sources in New Zealand and worldwide. An exception exists for exempt income and excluded income (although excluded income can be taxable under other provisions such as taxable distributions from non-complying trusts: s BF 1(b)). However, for a New Zealand tax resident, if an amount is income, it will not generally make a difference to taxability that it comes from overseas. 82. Further, an amount may be income derived by a New Zealand resident regardless of whether the amount itself ever comes to New Zealand. 83. This principle of taxing the worldwide income of New Zealand tax residents includes income from trusts established overseas. Taxation of income from trusts – overview 84. The laws dealing with trust taxation (referred to here, for convenience, as the trust rules) generally tax amounts derived through trusts as “trustee income” (taxable to trustees) as “beneficiary income” or as “taxable distributions”. 85. Trustee income is income derived by trustees that is not beneficiary income. Whether an amount derived by a trustee is trustee income or beneficiary income depends (broadly speaking) on whether the amount is income retained by the trustees (trustee income) or income transferred to beneficiaries soon after being derived (beneficiary income). 86. New Zealand tax residents (other than “transitional residents”) are taxable on beneficiary income from all trusts, whether the trustees derived the income from New Zealand or offshore. For transitional residents, foreign sourced beneficiary income is exempt income, that is, not taxable. 87. The trust rules classify trusts as complying trusts, non-complying trusts or foreign trusts. These classifications are relevant to determining whether distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income are taxable to New Zealand tax residents. 88. Distributions to beneficiaries of complying trusts, other than of beneficiary income, are not taxable income of a beneficiary. 89. Distributions to beneficiaries of foreign trusts, other than of beneficiary income, corpus (value contributed to the trust fund) or certain capital profits, are called taxable distributions. They are taxable income of the beneficiaries when derived, as is any beneficiary income. These distributions from foreign trusts (both taxable distributions and beneficiary income) are the focus of this Interpretation Statement. 90. In most cases, a trust is a foreign trust where no settlor (that is, anyone contributing value to the trust fund) has been resident in New Zealand at any time since a settlement was first made on the trust. In some circumstances trusts can be complying trusts as well as foreign trusts (such “dual status” trusts, are discussed from \[8.47\] of IS 18/01) and distributions from such trusts are not treated as taxable distributions. 91. Any trust other than a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Beneficiary income from non- complying trusts is taxable, and distributions to beneficiaries, other than of beneficiary income and corpus, are also taxable distributions and are taxed at a penalty tax rate of 45%. Distributions from non-complying trusts are not the subject of this Interpretation Statement. 92. With some exceptions (see \[145\]), “ordering rules” override the nominal nature of distributions from foreign and non- complying trusts that would otherwise apply based on the trust deeds or the exercise of the trustees’ discretion. These are discussed in more detail from \[144\], but the ordering rules determine whether a distribution is treated, for tax purposes, as a distribution of income or capital gains of current or previous years or of corpus. They, therefore, determine whether Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 36 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS a distribution will be a taxable distribution or not. For instance, the ordering rules mean current income is deemed to be distributed first, then retained income, capital gains and, lastly, corpus. This is regardless of what is stated in the trust minutes or records. 93. If the records of a foreign or non-complying trust do not allow for an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution (that is, current and previous years’ income or capital gains and the corpus), the distribution is treated as being entirely a taxable distribution. 94. A New Zealand resident beneficiary who receives beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust, including in some cases from an overseas estate, is required to complete a disclosure on Inland Revenue form IR307 Schedule of Beneficiary’s Estate or Trust Income for the income year in which they derive the distribution. Taxing beneficiary income and taxable distributions 95. This Interpretation Statement is concerned with money or property that is distributed or transferred to a New Zealand tax resident (other than through a sale or purchase or other transaction where the resident gives something in return). 96. The money or property does not have to be in New Zealand. It can be located offshore, for example in a bank account in the United Kingdom or in the form of a holiday home in Australia. 97. Sections CV 13, HC 17 and HC 18 make beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived through foreign trusts “income”. 98. Under s CV 13, an amount derived is income if it is beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust: An amount derived by a person is income of the person if it is— (a) beneficiary income to which sections HC 6 (Beneficiary income) and HC 17 (Amounts derived as beneficiary income) apply; or (b) a settlement on trust of property of the kind described in section HC 7(3) (Trustee income); or (c) a taxable distribution from a foreign trust to which section HC 18 (Taxable distributions from foreign trusts) applies. \[Emphasis added\]. 99. Sections HC 17 and HC 18 confirm that beneficiary income and taxable distributions are income in the year they are derived. 100. Money or property, therefore, will not be taxable as beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust (or from a non-complying trust) if it did not come from a trust. For something to come from a trust, it must be established that the transfer is from something that amounts to a “trust” in terms of the use of that word in the Act. Whether an arrangement is a “trust” 101. The word trust is not defined in the Act (other than in a limited definition in relation to superannuation schemes and unit trusts). 102. Section 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates how statutes are to be interpreted: The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. 103. The Supreme Court in Commerce Commission v Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd \[2007\] NZSC 36, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 767 at \[22\] commented on this: \[22\] It is necessary to bear in mind that s 5 of the Interpretation Act 1999 makes text and purpose the key drivers of statutory interpretation. The meaning of an enactment must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose. Even if the meaning of the text may appear plain in isolation of purpose, that meaning should always be cross checked against purpose in order to observe the dual requirements of s 5. In determining purpose the Court must obviously have regard to both the immediate and the general legislative context. Of relevance too may be the social, commercial or other objective of the enactment. 104. In relation to the text, an important thing to consider is the natural and ordinary meaning of “trust”. The Oxford English Dictionary Online (accessed 10 December 2018) gives a few meanings but the only one that seems apt is the “law” meaning: an arrangement whereby a person (a trustee) holds property as its nominal owner for the good of one or more beneficiaries. ▪ A body of trustees. 105. The Trusts Act 2019 (the Trusts Act), which comes into force, for most purposes, from 30 January 2021, has a definition with more depth. This definition is regarded as consistent with the common law as it is currently but is not a codification of it. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 37 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 106. Section 12 specifies that, among other things, an “express trust” is a “trust” that must have the characteristics set out in s 14. These are: (a) it is a fiduciary relationship in which a trustee holds or deals with trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a permitted purpose; and (b) the trustee is accountable for the way the trustee carries out the duties imposed on the trustee by law. 107. To be covered by section 12, an arrangement must be a “trust”, an undefined term in the Trusts Act. Also, although section 12 defines an “express trust” , it is only “for the purposes of \[the Trusts Act\]”. The consequence of this is that the provisions in the rest of the Trusts Act will not generally apply to arrangements that do not meet the definition of “express trust”. Therefore, such arrangements may still be trusts if they would be recognised as trusts under law other than the Trusts Act. In ss 5(8) and (9), the Trusts Act makes clear that it does not codify trust law and that common law and equity rules can still apply if they are consistent with the Trusts Act and other enactments don’t require otherwise. 108. For present purposes, the tax laws do not specify that the Trusts Act definition of “express trust” be adopted. This means that although a consideration of the definition of “express trust” is likely to assist with and influence determining what is or is not a “trust” for tax purposes, the meaning to be given to the word “trust” in tax legislation is not limited to the meaning given to “express trust” by the Trusts Act. It is still necessary to consider other possible meanings. 109. Law of Trusts (NZ) (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 4 June 2019) contains the following definition (at \[1.4\]): A trust has been defined as “an equitable obligation under which a person (‘the Trustee’) having the control of property is bound to deal with that property either: (a) for the benefit of definite persons (of whom the trustee may be one) and any one of whom may enforce that obligation; or (b) for some object or purpose permitted by law.” (Garrow and Kelly’s Law of Trusts and Trustees 7th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2013) at \[1.1\]) Trusts can arise in the following ways (Garrow and Kelly at \[2.5\]) • An express trust A person (the settlor) creates an obligation during his or her lifetime. This is often done by the execution of a deed which names the settlor, trustees and beneficiaries and directs how the trust is to be administered. • An implied or presumed trust The intention to create a trust has not been expressed but is implied or presumed from the circumstances. This includes resulting trusts where property is transferred to trustees for a specific purpose and when the purpose is fulfilled there is a surplus left over. The trustees then hold this surplus for the creator of the trust. • The operation of law For example, constructive trusts, or in the case of an intestacy under the Administration Act 1969. In this case an intention to create a trust is imposed by the Court despite the fact that the person in whom the property is vested at the time had neither expressly nor impliedly undertaken any trust. 110. Law of Trusts (NZ) also notes (at \[1.5\]) that “For an express trust to be valid the following three certainties must exist”: certainty of intention (to create a trust), certainty of subject matter (“there can be no trust without property”) and certainty as to the object of the trust (it must be clear who is intended to benefit and to what extent). 111. The following are described (at \[1.6\]) as “essential structural elements”: There are four essential structural elements of a trust: (Garrow and Kelly, at \[1.26\]) (1) There must be a trustee. If no trustee has been appointed or the trustee dies, refuses to act or is unable to act, then the Court will appoint someone to fill that office. Section 51 of the Trustee Act 1956 sets out a number of circumstances in which the Court will appoint a new trustee. There are however some circumstances in which a person nominated for the purpose in the trust instrument may appoint new trustees (see s 43). (2) There must be property of a nature capable of being settled on a trust. It can be real or personal but it must be alienable at law. (3) There must be a beneficiary or beneficiaries. A trustee can be a beneficiary, but must not be the only beneficiary. (4) There must be an obligation on the trustee to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The obligation is an equitable one. \[Bold emphasis added\]. 112. It can be noted that these descriptions of the legal concept of a trust appear materially very similar to the definition of “express trust” in the Trusts Act. It could therefore generally be expected that an arrangement that meets the Trusts Act definition of “express trust” would also be a trust for tax purposes while an arrangement that does not have the characteristics listed in s 13 of the Trusts Act would be highly likely not to be a trust for tax purposes. However, while it may reflect the current state of equity and common law on the concept of a trust and therefore influential, it is possible that court decisions in the future may move from the Trusts Act position so it should not be taken as determining whether an arrangement is a trust for tax purposes. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 38 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 113. NZ Trusts and Asset Planning Guide (online looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, accessed 4 June 2019) notes (at \[120–201\]) that whether a trust arises is to be determined objectively: It is not necessary that at the creation of a trust, the settlor or testator should appreciate that their acts or words have the legal consequences inherent in a trust, for it to be valid. The assessment has been held to be an objective one, so that where a transaction objectively appears to be a trust, it will be held to be a trust, even if it is unclear whether the settlor actually intended for there to be a trust, and the settlor’s ignorance of the law of trusts would not necessarily be determinative: Ochi v Trustees Executors Ltd (2009) 2 NZTR ¶19-044 (HC) at \[30\]. \[Emphasis added\]. 114. The position under New Zealand law (generally and under the Trusts Act) is, therefore, that a trust is not an entity but a description of an equitable obligation the law imposes on a person holding property to deal with that property in a certain way; namely, for the benefit of beneficiaries or a charitable purpose. Circumstances will be found to give rise to a trust only where there is such a person (the trustee), property that can be the subject of the trust, someone (a beneficiary) for whose benefit the property is held and where the law imposes the required obligation. It is an objective exercise to determine whether a trust exists. 115. The legal concept of a trust is consistent with dictionary meanings for present purposes. No other concept would be commonly understood to be a “trust”, in New Zealand at least. Other countries that have the concept of a trust have similar requirements for identifying arrangements as trusts. These circumstances suggest that the legal concept of a trust is likely to be what is intended generally in the trust rules in the Act when the word “trust” appears. 116. These circumstances also suggest that the natural and ordinary meaning of “trust” in the tax legislation is along the lines of what would be held to be a trust under New Zealand law; that is, a trust is not an entity but a description of the obligations and duties on persons who hold property for the benefit of other persons. 117. The trust rules include, relevantly, subpart HC, which contains most of the provisions concerning taxing trusts and distributions from trusts. Section HC 1(1) describes what these provisions do: (1) This subpart, together with the trust rules,— (a) provides for the taxation of distributions from trusts, for this purpose defining— (i) beneficiary income: (ii) a taxable distribution: (b) provides for the taxation of trustee income: (c) classifies trusts into the following 3 categories for the purposes of determining the treatment of distributions that are not beneficiary income: (i) complying trusts: (ii) foreign trusts: (iii) non-complying trusts: (d) determines who is a settlor, and sets out their income tax liability: (e) sets out the treatment of trusts settled by persons becoming resident in New Zealand. 118. In s HC 1(1)(c), trusts are said to be classified into three categories for the purposes of deciding the tax treatment of distributions (that are not of beneficiary income). Section HC 9 classifies a trust at the time of distribution: A trust is classified at the time it makes a distribution as— (a) a complying trust under section HC 10: (b) a foreign trust under section HC 11: (c) a non-complying trust under section HC 12. 119. There is no fourth category of “trust” that is not a complying, non-complying or foreign trust (other than “dual status” trusts mentioned above at \[89\] and discussed in \[8.14\] to \[8.47\] of IS 18/01). Each category is a classification of a trust, so this does not address whether something that would not be a trust according to New Zealand trust law, should be a trust for the purposes of the trust rules. 120. However, nothing in the legislative context appears to suggest that the word trust is intended to have a special meaning when it is used in the sections dealing with “foreign trusts” or that there needs to be anything expressly describing something as a trust for there to be a trust. If the surrounding circumstances, considered objectively, show there is an arrangement with the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law, the property should be regarded as held on trust for the purposes of the trust rules. 121. This intention as to meaning can be illustrated by considering what the trust rules would clearly apply to and why. It is uncontroversial, for instance, that the trust rules apply to real estate situated in New Zealand held by someone on the terms of a trust deed, whether a New Zealand resident or not, and who holds it for the benefit of someone else. This is so whether Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 39 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS the property is held for beneficiaries who are resident or not. The property would be regarded as held in trust for the beneficiaries under New Zealand law, and there could be no argument about the arrangement being treated as a trust that is subject to the trust rules. If there is a New Zealand settlor, then it would not be a foreign trust, but it would still be a trust. 122. The same applies to foreign property held by a foreign trustee. Provided there is a New Zealand resident beneficiary, distributions to New Zealand beneficiaries can be taxable if they satisfy the criteria in the relevant provisions of the Act. The location of the property, the settlor or the trustee need not make a difference. 123. Many of the provisions in the Act that are applicable to “foreign trusts” can be taken to assume that property in foreign jurisdictions can be subject to a “trust” or that New Zealand–situated property can have duties owed in respect of it by persons (trustees) wherever they might be resident (although the settlor must not be a New Zealand resident). For these provisions to have meaningful effect, it must have been intended that the “trust” concept not be limited simply because another jurisdiction might not have the same rules as to what is a trust or how they operate, or any rules for that matter. 124. It is New Zealand tax law that is being applied to a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust” and New Zealand tax law (the trust rules) that is being interpreted. It is, therefore, appropriate that it should be the New Zealand law concept of a trust that is applicable; that is, what is a trust according to the law of this country. Otherwise, any situation that would clearly be a trust under the law here could be argued not to be subject to the trust rules because the laws of another country would not recognise the situation as a trust. 125. Consistent with this is a proposition put forward in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (7th ed, LexisNexis, London, 2017) at 544, that a “term is presumed to have its ordinary meaning in the territory to which an enactment extends, even if it applies in relation to a foreign context”. This is discussed in a comment (at 545) following the proposition: Difficulty may arise where a court is asked to construe an enactment which uses English words but applies in relation to a foreign context where the words have a different meaning. The presumption is that the words should be given ‘their ordinary meaning in the English language as applied to such a subject-matter’ (Clerical, Medical and General Life Assurance Society v Carter (Surveyor of Ta x e s ) (1889) 22 QBD 444 per Lord Esher MR at 448). Here the reference to the English language means that language as understood in the territory to which the enactment extends. 126. Identifying whether a distribution comes from a trust would seem to be a similar question to identifying whether an enterprise is a body corporate so as to be a “company”, a defined term for New Zealand tax purposes. Professor John Prebble, in “Recognition of foreign enterprises as taxable entities”, Cahiers de Droit Fiscal International Vol LXXIIIa (1988): 493 at 496, summarised what he considered should be the analytical steps to determine whether an entity organised under foreign laws met the requirements to be a company: That is New Zealand would refer to the foreign law to determine the nature of the entity, but would characterise the entity according to its own notion of what is, and of what is not, a body corporate. The question as to whether the participators were shareholders or partners, and, if the former, whether they had derived a dividend, would follow, more or less automatically, being determined in the same manner, by reference to rights and duties established pursuant to the foreign law, but characterised according to New Zealand law. 127. The cases of C L Dreyfus v IRC (1929) 14 TC 560 (CA) and Ryall v The DuBois Company Ltd (1933) 18 TC 431 (CA) are examples of the courts, for English revenue law purposes, giving significance to the way the law applies in a foreign jurisdiction. In the former case, the separate legal personality of an entity in France meant it was not a “partnership” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, 1918 (UK). In the latter case, the court considered the German entity in question had similar attributes and was the same in nature as an English limited company. The decision was, therefore, that amounts received by the taxpayer in England were income from “stocks” or “shares” despite coming from an entity that was incorporated in a different jurisdiction. 128. In the Canadian case of Sommerer v The Queen (2011) TCC 212, the Tax Court of Canada considered that determining whether a foreign arrangement (an Austrian “foundation”) should be treated as a trust required identifying the essential elements of a trust under Canadian law and comparing the elements of the foreign arrangement with those elements. On appeal \[(2012) DTC 5,126\], the Federal Court of Appeal reached a conclusion in the case on different grounds but did not take substantive issue with the lower court’s approach on this point, preferring to express the test in terms of the property in question being subject to conditions that are “analogous to the legal and equitable obligations of a trustee in a common law jurisdiction”. 129. Conflict of laws principles may also offer some guidance. In Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws (13th ed, London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2000), it is suggested that academic opinion favours a “domestic law of the forum” (or lex fori) approach as a solution to the problem of characterising the question to be decided and which law to apply. The following is said at \[2.009\]: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 40 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS If the forum has to characterise a rule or institution of foreign law, it should inquire how the corresponding or most closely analogous rule or institution of its own law is characterised, and apply that characterisation to the foreign institution or rule. 130. Unless an anti-avoidance provision applies, it is the true nature of the legal arrangements actually entered into and carried out that will determine the tax consequences and not their substance or what name the parties give to an arrangement: Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 694 (CA). 131. As noted above, the legal arrangements can include the rights and obligations arising for the parties under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction. It does not follow, however, that all arrangements treated as valid trusts in a foreign jurisdiction will be trusts for New Zealand tax purposes, or vice versa. Moreover New Zealand is not a signatory to the Hague Convention and consequently is not obliged to recognise the existence of a trust because it is seen as such in a foreign jurisdiction. 132. Each situation requires analysis to determine whether it would give rise to a trust for New Zealand law purposes taking into account the rights and obligations arising under foreign law. For example, it may be an appropriate conclusion that an arrangement is not a trust because of the degree of control the settlor retains over trust property, including having it returned to the settlor or where a settlor/trustee has no accountability for what would otherwise be considered a breach of trust. 133. That successful arguments can sometimes be made that arrangements, described as trusts in documents, may not be treated as effective trusts can be illustrated by Re the AQ Revocable Trust, BQ v DQ \[2010\] 13 ITELR 260 (a trust valid under United States (US) trust law but not recognised as a trust by a Bermudan court) and Mezhdunarodniy Promyshlenniy Bank v Pugachev \[2017\] EWHC 2426 (Ch) (a UK decision where “trust” deeds establishing New Zealand foreign trusts allowed a former Russian oligarch to retain his beneficial ownership of assets and so were either bare trusts for his benefit or were a sham). 134. For the above reasons, it is, therefore, considered that the word “trust” is used in the Act to refer to the situation where the true nature of the arrangement is that there is a legal obligation of a particular type on someone who holds property for the benefit of a person or object. Whether such an obligation exists turns on there being circumstances that give rise to something that has the essential features of a trust under New Zealand law; namely that a person (trustee) holds trust property and has a fiduciary obligation to deal with the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries or for a charitable purpose. Wherever in the world property is situated, if the legal basis on which it is owned or controlled and the surrounding circumstances are such that there are obligations that New Zealand law would recognise as trust obligations, then a trust exists for tax legislation purposes. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions from foreign trusts 135. Having identified that money or property comes from a trust, the next question is whether anything is taxable in the hands of the recipient. This will depend on whether anything is “beneficiary income” and whether there has been a “distribution” and whether that distribution is a “taxable distribution” from a “foreign trust”. 136. Interpretation Statement IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts – Income Tax (Inland Revenue, 2018) contains the following description of “beneficiary income”: 5.5 “Beneficiary income” is defined in s HC 6 as “income” derived in an income year by a trustee to the extent to which it: (a) “vests absolutely in interest” in a beneficiary of the trust in the income year; or (b) is “paid” to a beneficiary in the income year or within the extended time period described in s HC 6(1B). 137. A “distribution” is defined broadly in the Act and in terms of a transfer of value. IS 18/01 discusses this: 8.7 A trustee makes a “distribution” when the trustee “transfers value” to a person because the person is a beneficiary of the trust (s HC 14). 8.8 “Transfers value” is defined in s YA 1. It is a net concept in the sense that it takes into account the market value of what is provided by, in this context, the trustee and the market value of what (if anything) is provided in return by the beneficiary. The definition is discussed in detail from \[2.20\] in the context of the definition of “settlor”. 138. IS 18/01 paraphrases the definition of foreign trust (at \[8.39\]): “Foreign trusts are trusts that have not had a New Zealand resident settlor at any time since 17 December 1987”. 139. In general terms, a “settlor” is anybody who has transferred value to a trust without getting something in return. Therefore, it will be important to know the background and where the property in the trust in question came from to determine whether it is a foreign trust. Under s HC 11, a trust will be a “foreign trust at a moment in time if no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time in the period that starts on ... the date on which a settlement was first made on the trust; and ends with the moment in time”. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 41 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 140. An amount of beneficiary income will be taxable to a New Zealand resident no matter what type of trust it comes from. Amounts other than beneficiary income that are distributions from a foreign trust will be taxable if they are a “taxable distribution” as defined in s HC 15. IS 18/01 states: 8.65 In relation to a foreign trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent to which it is not a distribution of: (a) an amount that is beneficiary income; (b) a part of the corpus of the trust; (c) a profit from the realisation of a capital asset or another capital gain (other than a capital gain or other capital profit made with an associated person); (d) a foreign superannuation withdrawal; (e) a payment or transaction that represents a distribution of either the corpus of the trust or a capital gain. 141. This legislative framework makes it important to identify how much of the distribution should be treated as corpus, capital and so forth. For this, the ordering rules in s HC 16 need to be applied to every foreign trust distribution that is not beneficiary income or from a trust that is within an exception to s HC 16. As explained from \[144\], the ordering rules can result in some or all of a distribution being treated as made up of income derived by a trustee. Any current year income will be beneficiary income and will be taxable as that rather than as a taxable distribution, if vested in or paid to a beneficiary in the same year as derived by the trustee or paid to a beneficiary within the extended time allowed by s HC 6(1B). 142. Note: Section HC 15 (in relation to 8.65(c) as referred to in the quotation in \[140\]) has been changed to modify the associated person exception. The effect of section 209 of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 is that distributions will not be taxable distributions just because they are of capital gains realised by the trustee on distributions of property to beneficiaries from a foreign trust or distributions of realised capital gains made when a trustee sells assets to associated parties including beneficiaries. This is effective from 18 March 2019, but if a taxpayer has taken a tax position before 18 March 2019 that is consistent with this change that will be treated as correct. Ordering rules (section HC 16) 143. The application of the ordering rules is a very important consideration for any taxpayer in determining whether they might have derived a taxable distribution from a foreign trust. The rules may characterise amounts distributed as something different to what the amounts are nominally. In other words, the ordering rules don’t have to respect the description a trustee gives to the distribution in question or what the relevant trust deed provides. 144. IS 18/01 outlines the rules and how they work: 8.108 Because some distributions will be taxable and some not, opportunities could arise for avoiding or deferring tax on income accumulated in trusts by distributing taxable amounts to non-resident beneficiaries or by distributing non-taxable amounts before taxable amounts. The ordering rules for distributions in s HC 16 limit opportunities for manipulating distributions from foreign and non-complying trusts in this manner. This is achieved by providing a series of ordering rules that determine the order in which amounts are treated as having been distributed from such trusts. 8.109 These ordering rules override the treatment of the distributions that would otherwise apply based on the terms of the trust or the exercise of the trustee’s discretion. The rules can affect whether a distribution is treated as a distribution of income, a capital gain or corpus, and so determine whether a distribution will be a taxable distribution or not. Therefore, as noted earlier, it is necessary to interpret the definition of taxable distribution and the ordering rules together. 8.110 The ordering rules in s HC 16 apply when a trustee of a foreign or non-complying trust makes a distribution to a beneficiary. The four exceptions to the ordering rules are discussed from \[8.143\]. 8.111 Where they apply, the ordering rules treat a distribution as being made up of the following elements in the following order: (a) income derived by the trustee in the current income year; (b) income derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; (c) a capital gain derived by the trustee in the current income year; (d) a capital gain derived by the trustee in an earlier income year; and (e) the corpus of the trust. 8.112 The ordering rules apply on an end of year basis. That is, a distribution is not characterised at the time at which it is made. Rather, distributions are characterised at the end of the income year in which they are made by reference to the total income and capital gains derived in that income year (and previous income years). When the ordering rules are applied, they are applied individually to each distribution made by the trustee in the order in which the distributions are made (subject to potential reordering under s HC 16(5), as discussed from \[8.129\]). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 42 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 8.113 The amount of each element (eg, current year income) is finite. Once an amount of an element has been treated under s HC 16 as included in a distribution that amount is no longer available to be treated as included in another distribution. This means that the order in which the distributions are made can be significant. 8.114 For each distribution, the elements must be applied in the order above. The next element is relevant only to the extent that the total of the available amounts in the elements so far considered is less than the amount of the distribution. 145. There are exceptions to the ordering rules. The most important for present purposes is the exception in s HC 16 for “non- discretionary trusts” arising on death. Where this section applies, the source of a distribution is determined by the terms of the trust or the trustee resolution making the distribution. IS 18/01 comments on the non-discretionary trusts exception: 8.146 Section HC 16 does not apply to a distribution if: (a) the trust is a “non-discretionary trust”; and (b) one of the following applies: (i) the trust was created by will or codicil (an amendment to a will) or by an order of court modifying a will or codicil; (ii) the trust was created on an intestacy or partial intestacy; or (iii) no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987. 8.147 A “non-discretionary trust” is a trust where the trustee has no discretion to determine the source, nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries. This means, among other things, that the trustee has no discretion to classify trust property as capital or income. 146. If an exception to the ordering rules does not apply, a beneficiary needs information on the trust’s circumstances and history to be able to apply the ordering rules. Ideally, this information will be in the form of good financial records (modified as necessary to show current year income, accumulated income, capital gains and corpus according to New Zealand income tax law – see IS 18/01 at \[8.119\]) and should include details of all settlements on the trust, gains in value of trust property and distributions that have been made by the trust, in the year in question and in previous years. In the absence of financial statements, other material and evidence is potentially relevant but the onus is on the beneficiary to prove the elements of a distribution to a satisfactory level of accuracy. In \[8.157\] of 18/01, it is noted that if there are adequate records relating to corpus but not to income or capital gains, it will still be possible for a final distribution not to be taxable to the extent the amount does not exceed the corpus. 147. Therefore, where s HC 16 and the ordering rules apply, the recipient of a distribution must point to evidence that allows application of the rules. As IS 18/01 notes, if they can’t, the distribution will be deemed to be taxable: 8.155 If the records of a foreign or non-complying trust do not allow an accurate determination of the elements of a distribution under s HC 16 (ie, current and previous year income and capital gain amounts and the corpus of the trust), the distribution is a taxable distribution (s HC 15(7)). 148. The consequences of a distribution being taxable in this way will often justify a concerted effort on the part of a beneficiary to locate the required information. This may be difficult, but the onus is on the beneficiary to demonstrate that the ordering rules apply in the way the beneficiary contends. 149. It should be noted that non-discretionary will trusts may still give rise to taxable distributions when distributing accumulated income and certain capital gains, but the records requirement is not as likely to be an issue as it would be for other trusts. This is because the ordering rules will not apply and it is potentially less complex to determine what has been distributed. Administration of estates 150. Different countries have different laws for the administration of estates. It follows that the legal basis on which property is owned or controlled may be different too and could lead to a different conclusion on whether a trust arises. However, many countries have laws like the laws in New Zealand, especially common law countries. Therefore, some discussion of the law here in New Zealand relating to the administration of estates is useful to illustrate when a trust (that is not a “bare trust” and ignored for tax purposes – see discussion at \[194\] below) might arise when a deceased estate is being administered overseas. New Zealand estate administration and trusts 151. When a person dies, the law determines what happens to the money and property that they owned (their estate) at the date of death. If the deceased died without a will (intestate), the law provides for the appointment of an administrator and succession to the estate (that is, who inherits) after a process of identifying and collecting assets, satisfying liabilities and distributing what is left (the residue). If the deceased made a will, the executors named in the will have the job of identifying, collecting, satisfying and distributing according to the instructions of the deceased in the terms of the will. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 43 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 152. The instructions in a will may include paying out or distributing legacies or gifts of specific amounts or specific property to named people. These legacies or gifts may be referred to as specific legacies. 153. The instructions in a will may also expressly provide for trusts (testamentary trusts). This might be a direction to executors to hold property on trust for specified beneficiaries or it might be a direction to establish a trust to hold property for specified beneficiaries (for which a trust deed is usually formalised). If a distribution is made from a trust established under such instructions, the Act applies as it would for any distribution from a trust established by a person during their lifetime. 154. Whether the deceased left a will or not, and even for a will that does not expressly instruct for there to be a trust, a trust may still arise at some point. This may be because, for example, heirs are not yet of an age to inherit or there is a life interest. 155. However, a trust does not arise immediately on the death of the deceased. Tax Implications of Certain Asset Transfers (Officials’ issues paper, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, 2003) describes the legal process in New Zealand for property moving from a deceased person to beneficiaries (at 11 and 12): 4.4 On the death of a taxpayer, the estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists and, when a will does exist, the taxpayer’s intentions as set out in the will (for example, whether there are to be a trust, legacies, and so on). Normally, it takes one to two years to wind up an estate and distribute the assets to the beneficiaries. There are several discrete points in this process at which a property disposition could be deemed to have occurred – on death, on transfer from executor to trustee, or on distribution to legatees and beneficiaries. 4.5 A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate. Legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property vests in the executors or administrators from the time of death through to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not, with the exception of specific legacies, have more than an inchoate right in the assets. 4.6 The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. 4.7 Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Under the “doctrine of relation back”, specific legacies take effect from the date of death, whereas general and residuary legacies vest in the beneficiary(ies) at the time of distribution. \[Emphasis added\]. 156. Other commentaries (and cases, for example, Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan Livingston \[1965\] AC 694) confirm that, although executors and administrators are subject to fiduciary duties during the period of their executorship or administration, neither the beneficial nor the legal interest in the estate assets (that are not the subject of specific legacies) moves to those who stand to inherit. For instance, Laws of New Zealand: Trusts Part 1 (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 18 December 2018), under the title “Introduction to Trusts: Nature of Trusts and of the Trust Relationship”, says: Personal representatives and trustees. In a loose sense, a legal personal representative (while acting as such) is a trustee for the creditors and beneficiaries claiming under the deceased, as that personal representative holds the real and personal estate of the deceased for the benefit of the deceased and not for his or her own benefit. Moreover, in the Trustee Act 1956 the term “trust” extends to the duties incidental to the office of an administrator under the Administration Act 1969. However, during the administration of the estate of the deceased, whether a testator, or an intestate, no legatee, devisee, or next of kin has any beneficial interest in the assets being administered; he or she has merely an equitable right to have the estate administered properly. This right is enforced by means of a devastavit action. \[Emphasis added\]. 157. In England the position is similar. Williams on Wills (9th ed, LexisNexis Butterworths, 2008) notes (at \[1.8\]): Although the title to the assets vests in the personal representative and the will is said to take effect in equity only, the property comprised in residue is not held on trust for the beneficiary under the will so as to vest any equitable interest in him. It is in fact a fallacy to seek for the separate existence of the equitable beneficiary interest in the assets during the period of administration. ... Thus the legatee of a share of the residue has no interest in any of the property of the testator until the residue has been ascertained. ... It has been held that this right is in the nature of a chose in action. ... Likewise, persons entitled on intestacy have no interest in the deceased’s assets during administration. 158. Being an executor is not the same as being a trustee: In re Jane Davis, In re T H Davis, Evans v Moore \[1891\] 3 Ch 119. NZ Trusts and Asset Planning Guide (online looseleaf ed, CCH New Zealand, accessed 4 June 2019) notes (at \[123–401\]) the difference between the two roles of executor and trustee and refers to authority as to the time at which an executor becomes a trustee: An executor carries into effect a deceased’s will. The duties of an executor include to collect and get in the assets of the deceased, pay expenses and debts and discharge legacies under the will (Re Branson (Deceased) (1911) 31 NZLR 79, at p 82). In comparison, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 44 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS the essential duties of a trustee of a trust created under the will are to obtain possession or control of the trust property, get in funds due to the trust estate, preserve the trust property and to secure it from loss or risk of loss and to conform to and carry out the terms of the trust. “The change in character from personal representative (executor) to trusteeship occurs when the estate has been fully administered, in the sense that all the debts and liabilities have been discharged and the residue ascertained ...” (Hansen v Young \[2004\] 1 NZLR 37 (CA), at para \[29\]). 159. These comments suggest that, strictly speaking, any trust from which distributions are made to beneficiaries will arise only once the personal representatives are ready to distribute. This is because the law of estate administration in New Zealand is that personal representatives have the legal and beneficial interest in property passing on the death of a person, but they do not hold the legal interest on a trust under which those ultimately entitled to the property have a beneficial interest (or under which they might receive a distribution as a beneficiary of a trust). Such a beneficial interest does not arise, whether for particular property or the residual estate, until the personal representatives have completed their duties in the administration of the estate and there is a transition from the role of personal representative to the role of trustee. 160. This position is not altered by the fact that, under the Act, an executor or administrator is treated as a trustee (specifically, s YA 1 defines “trustee” to include an executor or administrator). Although a personal representative is to be considered a trustee for tax purposes, it does not follow that a trust arises on death or during administration. It just means that provisions referring to “trustee” may have a broader application than they otherwise would. Where a section refers to “trust” but not “trustee”, interpretation of the section requires consideration of the meaning to be given to the word trust. As noted, this would not generally include an estate during administration. 161. A personal representative will become a trustee at the point at which they have identified the residue of the estate and assent to the property in the estate becoming subject to a trust: Re McGregor (deceased) \[1960\] NZLR 220 at 229 (CA). The dispositions in the will become operative on such assent: George Attenborough & Son v Solomon \[1913\] AC 76 (HL). 162. Such assent can happen for property outside of residue and at different times for different property. The commentary in Laws of New Zealand: Trusts Part 1 set out above continues: When the personal representatives realise that specific property left on trusts is not going to be resorted to to enable debts, expenses, and liabilities to be satisfied, they may assent to that property being held on trust in the strict sense. It is often important to determine when a personal representative has completed his or her functions as such in relation to any property and holds the property solely as a trustee in the strict sense; this is because there are differences in the powers of personal representatives as such and trustees, and also the period of limitation applicable to an action may depend in certain cases upon whether the defendant holds the property which is the subject of the claim as personal representative or as trustee. Moreover, as the duty of personal representatives is owed to the estate as a whole, they, unlike trustees, do not have to hold the balance evenly between those interested in income and those interested in capital. \[Emphasis added\]. 163. More explanation of “assent” can be found in Laws of New Zealand: Administration of Estates II – Assents (online ed, LexisNexis NZ, accessed 4 June 2019): 457. Necessity for assent. The bequest of a legacy, whether general or specific, or of real estate transfers only an inchoate property to the legatee: the executor's assent is necessary to render it complete and perfect. The right is one which devolves on the legatee's personal representatives should the legatee die before the assent is given. In the case of a release of a debt by will, the executor's assent is necessary, as the release in effect amounts to a legacy of the debt. The necessity for assent by an executor applies to residuary bequests and to interests arising under a partial intestacy. An executor may assent to part of a residuary gift without assenting to the whole. The assent of one of several representatives to a bequest of pure personalty is sufficient; even though the bequest is to that representative. An executor may assent before probate. The assent will not be affected by their dying without having obtained probate, provided the will is subsequently proved. An executor may be compelled by the legatee to assent should they refuse to do so without just cause. \[Emphasis added\]. 164. The assent need not be in any particular form and it is a question of fact whether assent has occurred: 459. Assent by implication. An assent to the vesting of real or personal estate may be express or implied; it need not be in writing nor need it be given in any particular form. Informal expressions, if sufficiently clear to indicate intention, may amount to an assent. The assent may also be implied from the executor's conduct: thus, the application in the maintenance of minors, of rents of leaseholds bequeathed to the executor in trust for maintaining them during minority, and afterwards in trust for the legatee on attaining their majority; allowing a legatee of a term to receive the income; the payment by the executor of rent, coupled with the charging of the legatee with the payments in account; or the payment of a charge subject to which a legacy is given; would amount to an assent to the bequest. However, an executor may, and often does, make general payments to a legatee without binding themselves to an assent; and the Court will not infer an assent in such circumstances unless there is evidence that the executor intended to assent as, for instance, by representations to that effect or by special payments out of or on account of rents to which the legatee would be entitled after assent. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 45 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS In case of dispute, the question whether there has been an assent or not is generally one of fact. An expression which is ambiguous and applies equally to either view is no evidence of an assent. \[Emphasis added\]. 165. The assent, once given in respect of property, vests title to a legacy immediately: 461. Irrevocability and relation back. The assent once given is irrevocable. The title to a legacy vests immediately upon the assent in the legatee; so as to enable them to bring an action at law against the executor or any other person in possession of the bequest. The legatee of a specific legacy has the right to recover the intermediate profits of the thing bequeathed. Where executors who are also trustees under the will have assented, they cease to hold the property as executors and from then on hold it as trustees. \[Emphasis added\]. 166. The power to assent belongs to a personal representative: 462. Assents in relation to trusteeship. The power to assent is confined to personal representatives. Difficulties can arise as to whether a personal representative who may have fully administered and become a trustee still has power to assent and whether they need to assent in their own favour as trustee. The capacities of personal representative and trustee are not mutually exclusive, and a personal representative who has fully administered the estate and holds the residue as a trustee is not thereby necessarily and automatically discharged from their obligations as personal representative. A personal representative retains their character as such (as distinct from their statutory powers of management) for all time; or, in the case of a grant of administration for a limited period, until the termination of the period of the grant. 167. One of the ways a personal representative becomes a trustee is when they have assented: 463. When a personal representative becomes a trustee. If property is specifically devised or bequeathed to an executor upon trust they become trustee of it when they have assented; or when they have severed the property from the rest of the estate; or when they have executed a declaration of trust. As regards residue, the major change in character from representation to trusteeship occurs when the estate has been fully administered in the sense that all debts and liabilities have been discharged and the residue ascertained. When the trusts affecting the residue are designed to continue after completion of the administration, the executor should thereupon execute an assent to the vesting of the residue in themselves as trustee. \[Emphasis added\]. 168. Further discussion on testamentary trusts, “assent” and related aspects of administration of estates in New Zealand can be found in the cases of Re Estate Eagle; Barbalich v Kennedy (1997) 1 NZTR 7-003 (HC Auckland M721/97), Sullivan v Brett \[1981\] 2 NZLR 202, and Re Maguire (deceased) \[2010\] 2 NZLR 845. 169. The cases confirm that: • • Until assent, beneficiaries do not have any proprietary interest in residue and residue is not held by the executors on trust in a relevant sense; • • An executor, at some point, either transfers residue to beneficiaries or assents to the vesting of that property in someone, which can include themselves, acting in the capacity of a trustee; • • Assent is evidence that an executor is ready to end their interest in the property in question and it can pass according to the terms of the will; • • Assent can be in respect of particular estate property before residue is ascertained (an inference that assent has occurred can be made from the fact of distribution); • • An express or formal assent is possible although not common in New Zealand; • • Where there has been no formal assent, once administration has got to the point that all debts and legacies have been paid and residue has been “ascertained”, assent can be inferred; • • The only action remaining following assent is for the personal representative to pass legal title to the beneficiaries of the will (or to a trustee to hold for beneficiaries that is to be someone other than the personal representative); • • Whether there has been assent does not turn on what the personal representative believes or intends, it is what the facts demonstrate;. • • If vested in a trustee, the trustee either holds the property on the trusts specified in the will (ie, testamentary trusts) or, if no trusts are specified, on trust according to the beneficiaries’ rights and interests under the will (this will be a bare trust). 170. It seems reasonable to conclude that the certainties required before a trust arises will be present on assent. The existence and identity of property will have been established, as will the beneficiaries. Assent will provide certainty of intention to create a trust. 171. An equitable obligation amounting to a trust, therefore, arises only following assent by the personal representatives to the property in question being held on trust by a trustee or trustees. Such assent can be express or inferred from the circumstances. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 46 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 172. If laws similar to the laws of administration of estates in New Zealand apply, where a testamentary trust or a life interest or a minority arises from a non-resident deceased’s estate, then following assent, the property will be held by a person (trustee) subject to that trust from assent. This may mean an executor changes “hats” (from assent) if they are going to be that ongoing trustee. Such a trust will be a foreign trust because the settlor is the deceased who is not a New Zealand resident and whose intentions to create a will trust are being carried out by the executors (an indirect transfer of value as provided for in s HC 27(4)). To determine the tax treatment of property or amounts transferred to a New Zealand beneficiary, the possibility that what is transferred to a New Zealand resident is a taxable distribution needs to be considered. However, the trust will often not be discretionary so that the ordering rules do not apply (as discussed in \[145\]). 173. Where a New Zealand beneficiary of a foreign deceased estate has a vested interest after assent, a “bare” trust will arise as a matter of law. As discussed from \[190\], this situation can be ignored for tax purposes. Although the personal representative will be a trustee according to trust law, they will be a bare trustee. They now hold the property subject to the direction and control of the beneficiary and, for New Zealand tax purposes, the beneficiary is treated as the owner of the property. Estate administration and trusts in other countries 174. The position outlined above for New Zealand estate administration and trust law is likely to be similar to the position in other common law jurisdictions such as Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. However, some countries may have materially different laws of succession and administration of estates. As noted earlier, many countries do not have the concept of a trust and have laws different to New Zealand’s law governing devolution of property on death. In Switzerland (a civil law country like France and Germany), for example, the entire estate of a person passes automatically by way of direct succession to the heirs on the person’s death. This is so whether the deceased dies testate or intestate. Trusts are not recognised as a legal arrangement in Switzerland, although it does recognise the existence of trusts in other countries. 175. This means that the position in such civil law countries is materially different from common law jurisdictions like New Zealand. A trust will not arise on death or following estate administration as the heirs have a vested legal interest immediately on death. There is no “interregnum” when the executor has the legal interest as in common law countries. It also means that transfers by personal representatives in civil law jurisdictions will not be a “distribution” for New Zealand tax purposes because they do not transfer value to heirs. The heirs already own what they inherit. 176. Further, the test discussed above for determining whether a “trust” exists was whether in all the circumstances a trust can be said to arise under New Zealand law. The facts relevant to concluding on that issue will include what legal obligations a person has in relation to property. In that case, the rules of another country as to what happens on death will affect legal obligations in relation to property. The fact that no property vests in a personal representative is critically relevant to the question of the existence or otherwise of a trust under New Zealand law. 177. As noted, a trust is an equitable obligation or set of obligations in respect of property under which a person holds property for the benefit of a person or object. The legal interest is held by one person, the beneficial interest by another. However, where the legal and beneficial interests in property move straight from a deceased to an inheritor, there will be nobody holding the legal interest in property other than the people who stand to inherit it. There will also be nothing that would expressly create a trust, such as a will or trust deed. 178. New Zealand law would not recognise a situation as a “trust” where the situation involves property that is not owned by someone who has obligations to deal with it for the benefit of someone else. The arrangements in civil law countries will not meet the requirements under New Zealand law to be a “trust” in that situation. 179. Depending on the situation in the particular country (and this would always have to be reviewed), it follows, therefore, that an amount distributed to a New Zealand heir from an estate administered in a civil law country, either in the course of or following administration, would not be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. This is because it is not a transfer of value made because the recipient is a beneficiary of a trust. 180. As an example of this, suppose person A acts as administrator of person B’s estate on B’s death in Switzerland, a civil law jurisdiction. After several years, A carries out the instruction in B’s will and transfers the proceeds of the sale of shares in a Swiss company owned by B at his death, to person C who lives in New Zealand. The process of administering and maintaining the estate may have taken several years but a trust will not arise because A did not own the shares and the shares vested in C on B’s death. Therefore, the question of a taxable distribution from a foreign trust does not arise. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 47 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 181. Likewise, there will be no distribution from a trust when A transfers to C the dividends that have accumulated on the shares during the administration. They will be treated as having been derived by C as taxable income from date of death, with A being a bare trustee, as discussed from \[190\]. Tax paid in Switzerland may be available as a credit against liability for tax in New Zealand. If C has not returned the dividends for tax in New Zealand, an adjustment to their assessments will be required. 182. The situation is likely to be different where a New Zealand resident receives a transfer from an estate being administered according to laws materially like the succession and administration laws here (for example, the laws in a common law jurisdiction). The transfer may be properly characterised as being “from a foreign trust” because the transferor is someone who has the legal interest in the property and has been holding it for the recipient who has the beneficial interest in it. 183. The outcome would be different if the situation were similar to the example above, but B died leaving a will instructing establishment of a trust for C and the shares, A and B were all in Australia. The Australian laws on trusts and estate administration are like those in New Zealand, so a trust will have arisen once A assented to the shares vesting in a trust (which will not be a bare trust). Then, when a subsequent transfer of the sale proceeds for the shares and of the dividends to C occurs, the transfer would be a “distribution”. 184. In short, in some countries, the legal interest in property devolves directly to inheritors. In others, like New Zealand, the legal interest is vested in someone other than the inheritors for a while. It follows that in the context of inheritance, one relevant circumstance that needs to be considered to determine whether an amount is a distribution from a trust is the effect of applicable laws of other countries. Effect on tax status of deceased’s estate during administration 185. As noted above, in New Zealand a trust will arise only once personal representatives are ready to distribute and have assented. From that point, the beneficiaries have an equitable interest in property subject to a trust, either a bare trust (ignored for tax) or an express or implied trust. 186. Before then, although it seems they are sometimes referred to as holding property “on trust”, the legal position is that they hold both the legal and the beneficial interests in the estate property “in right of the deceased” (see Nevill’s Law of Trusts, Wills and Administration (12th ed, LexisNexis, 2016) at \[19.11.6\]). They do not hold interests in the estate as trustee for beneficiaries. Heirs do not have any beneficial interest and can rely on only their right to force the representatives to carry out their duties. It, therefore, seems more appropriate to consider the representatives not (yet) to be trustees. This is likely to be the position for deceased estates in common law countries in general but unlikely to be the position in civil law countries. 187. As a result, a New Zealand tax resident will not derive anything that will be beneficiary income or a taxable distribution from a foreign trust unless: • • for common law countries, administration of an estate has at least reached the stage that personal representatives have assented to the property being held on trust; or • • for civil law countries, something has happened to the property before transfer to the resident that New Zealand law would consider gives rise to a trust (for instance, the property was transferred to someone in another country (a common law country) to hold on trust for the resident in New Zealand - a distribution made direct to the resident would not be a distribution from a trust). Bare trusts 188. Commentary referred to above also suggests that a trust can still arise by assent even though the personal representative has not got to the point of identifying the residuary estate. For instance, an executor may choose to distribute a specific legacy to the person named in the will as entitled to that legacy. Assent in relation to the property or amount forming that specific legacy would be inferred once the distribution is made and, technically, there might be a brief time when what is distributed is subject to a trust under general law. This situation would not give rise to a taxable distribution, however. This is for two reasons. 189. The first reason is because if it were a distribution from a foreign trust, it would be a distribution of corpus, being a specific legacy distributed from a specific non-discretionary trust created by will (and so excluded from the ordering rules in s HC 16 by s HC 16(6)(b)). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 48 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 190. The second reason is because not every distribution that would otherwise meet the legislative definition of “taxable distribution” will necessarily be a “taxable distribution from a foreign trust”. If the property is held on a “bare trust”, s YB 21 would have the effect of deeming no distribution to have been made by the person holding the property. Section YB 21 provides: YB 21 Transparency of nominees Treatment of nominee (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, if a person holds something or does something as a nominee for another person, the other person holds or does that thing and the nominee is ignored. Who is a nominee? (2) A person holds or does something as a nominee for another person if the person acts on the other person’s behalf. However, a trustee is a nominee only if the trustee is a bare trustee. Nominal settlements (3) A person making a nominal settlement at the request of another person is treated for the purposes of this Act as a nominee in relation to the settlement. \[Emphasis added\]. 191. In practical terms, and in the context of trusts arising in the administration of estates, the consequence of a trust being “bare” is that inheritors would not derive beneficiary income or taxable distributions but they would derive any income from the property in question. 192. The principles developed through the courts on what amounts to a “bare trust” are summarised in “Interpretation Statement IS 12/01: Income Tax – Timing of Share Transfers for the Purposes of the Continuity Provisions” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012):20: 112. Three principles can be distilled from these authorities: • A “bare trustee” is a person who holds property on trust for the absolute benefit and at the absolute disposal of other persons, and has no beneficial interest in the property. • A “bare trustee” does not have any duties to perform in regard to the property, except to convey or transfer it to a person entitled to hold it when required to do so. • For a bare trust relationship to exist, the three certainties of a trust must be satisfied. 193. “QB 16/03: Goods and Services Tax – GST Treatment of Bare Trusts”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 5 (June 2016): 16 describes a “bare trust” as: 5. A bare trust is a type of trust under which the trustee holds property on trust without any duties to perform other than to convey the trust property to the beneficiary or as the beneficiary directs. The reference to “duties” in this definition is to duties that the settlor has specified. For example, the trustee may have been appointed to hold the property as nominee, or the settlor may have required that the beneficiary be maintained until becoming entitled to call for capital and income on reaching the age of majority. Once the beneficiary reaches the age of majority, the trustee no longer has a duty to maintain the beneficiary. In both situations, the trustee is “bare” of any duties specified by the settlor. However, so long as a trustee holds property on trust, they always retain their legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property. The trustee cannot escape this duty: Herdegen v FCT 88 ATC 4995 (FCA); Waters’ Law of Trusts in Canada (4th ed, Carswell, Toronto, 2012) at 33–34. 6. Therefore, a bare trustee has not only a duty to transfer the trust property to the beneficiary (or as directed by the beneficiary), but also a legal duty to take reasonable care of the trust property in the meantime: Herdegen; CGU Insurance Ltd v One Tel Ltd (in liquidation) \[2010\] HCA 26; Corumo Holdings Pty Ltd v C Itoh Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 370 (CA); ISPT Nominees Pty Ltd v Chief Commissioner of State Revenue \[2003\] NSWSC 697. 7. What a bare trustee must do to fulfil their duty to protect trust property depends on the nature of the trust property and any threats to the trust property. However, a bare trustee must refrain from active management that does not fall within the duty to maintain the trust property: Bruton Holdings Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v FCT (2011) 193 FCR 442 (FCAFC). 194. The question, for s YB 21 purposes, will be whether a bare trustee (assuming that is the appropriate legal characterisation of someone’s capacity) “acts on behalf of ” the beneficiary. This will depend on the circumstances, but it would be unusual for someone holding property on a bare trust not to be acting on behalf of the person for whom the property is held. 195. In the context of estates, a trust will, therefore, arise only on completion of the personal representative’s role in relation to property and on the personal representative assenting in relation to that property. Then it will depend on the facts as to what is being distributed, and whether any transfer of the property to an heir is a transfer by a bare trustee. In that case, the trust rules will not apply because for tax purposes there is no trust. The beneficiary, not the trustee, is treated by s YB 21 as holding the property from the date of assent. If, on the other hand, the personal representative is more than a bare trustee, the transfer (or part of it) might be of beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to the extent it is not excluded by the application of s HC 15. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 49 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Consequences of an arrangement being a trust 196. A trust technically arises under the general law of many common law countries on assent. 197. The trust that arises following assent and before distribution will often be a bare trust that will not be recognised as a trust for tax purposes. A transfer of property to a New Zealand resident will, therefore, often not be a taxable distribution. This would be the case if the property continued to be held for a time because of practical difficulties in locating the beneficiary or transferring the property to them. During that time, the property would have been held for the absolute benefit of the beneficiary, who has the right to call for the property at any time and the trustee must act on that direction. 198. An administrative delay, following payment of all debts, in selling property in order to distribute the proceeds of sale to heirs would not follow assent so would not give rise to a taxable distribution. Another situation that might hold up assent would be where the will is contested or there is a claim on the estate. There will be a delay in sorting out who is entitled to the property, but it would be the personal representatives dealing with that in their capacity as representatives, not as trustees. They would not give assent for property affected by the contest or claim until the contest or claim were sorted. 199. However, if an executor continues to hold property in the capacity of trustee on a trust, expressly or impliedly, provided for in a will, and the trust is not a bare trust, then any transfer to beneficiaries may be a taxable distribution. Assuming an assent is express or can be inferred from the circumstances, a distribution when it is made might then give rise to a taxable distribution. This would be where, for instance, heirs of an intestate deceased are not of age or where a will provides for a life interest before the property goes to the heirs. In these situations, there will be contingencies and more than protection of the property before distribution, so there will not be a bare trust. 200. In the example discussed at \[183\], of an executor in Australia distributing the proceeds of sale of Australian shares to a New Zealand resident heir of a deceased Australian, the distribution was from a foreign trust. This is because the proceeds were part of the residuary estate that was held undistributed by the executor for a time. The deceased had died with a will that expressly provided for a trust to be established for the heir so a trust arose following assent. The ordering rules in s HC 16(2) would need to be considered, unless the trust was a non-discretionary trust covered by s HC 16(6)(b). 201. Assuming it was a discretionary trust, if the trust records were not good enough to allow application of the ordering rules, the transfer of the proceeds of sale of the shares and the accumulated dividends would together be a taxable distribution: s HC 15(7). If the records showed that only the accumulated dividends represented income derived since the trust started, then they would not be excluded from being a taxable distribution by s HC 15(4), but any capital gains made on the shares by the trust and their value when the trust started (corpus) would be excluded and would not form part of the taxable distribution. Summary 202. Common law countries are likely to have similar estate administration laws to those in New Zealand. This means that personal representatives, in that capacity, do not hold the property of a deceased person on trust for the heirs. Property will be subject to a trust only when personal representatives hold legal title subject to the terms of a trust, express or implied. This can happen only after they have given assent in relation to that property. Assent can be inferred from the circumstances and can be for individual items of property and before the residuary estate has been determined. Before such assent, the legal position is that the personal representatives hold both the legal and the beneficial interest in the estate property “in right of the deceased” rather than as trustee for beneficiaries. 203. A trust under general law and following assent can still arise for property distributed upon completion of administration. However, in a straightforward will disposition, such a trust is likely to be a bare trust that will not be a foreign trust for tax purposes and any distribution will not be a taxable distribution. Alternatively, where there is a testamentary trust or a will providing for life interests or no distributions to heirs who are minors, the property may continue to be held in trust and may be a taxable distribution when transferred to beneficiaries. A distribution in these circumstances could comprise more than corpus and could be subject to the ordering rules in s HC 16 as well as comprising current year or beneficiary income. 204. Distributions from estates of residents of civil law countries are less likely to be from trusts because heirs have a legal interest from the date of death.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 58 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions people have asked. They are published here as they may be of general interest to readers. QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED QB 19/15: If property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach or Holiday Houses). The most common situation where it will be a beneficiary renting out a property held in trust is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Renting out and similar terms are used in this QWBA to refer to granting a licence for the use of the property by short-stay accommodation guests. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation. Tr u s t is sometimes used in this QWBA as meaning the trustees of the trust, where this is helpful for simplicity. Question If property held in a discretionary trust is rented out by a beneficiary of the trust for short-stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Answer If property is held in a discretionary trust and a beneficiary rents all or part of it out for short-stay accommodation (eg, the property is the beneficiary’s home), the income belongs to the beneficiary as they’re the one granting the licence to the guests to stay. Non-capital costs 1 related to earning the income can be deducted, though some of these costs will only be partly deductible because they also relate to private use of the property. Explanation Who is renting out the property? 1. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, rental income from land belongs to the owner of the land and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. 2. Owning land is not limited to having the legal title. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), someone will own land if they have an estate or interest in land. This could be freehold, leasehold, or any other interest in land. 3. Beneficiaries of a discretionary trust do not have an interest in the trust property simply by virtue of being beneficiaries. So in many situations where a property is held in a trust, it will be only the trustees, who legally own the land, who have an interest in the land. This will generally be the case, for example, for a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or for a holiday home that is also sometimes rented out to third parties. Where only the trustees have an interest in the land, it will be the trustees renting out the property, and the rental income will belong to the trustees. 4. However, in some situations there will be different people with interests relating to the same underlying piece of land, and they will all be “owners” of land for income tax purposes. If this is the case, and the property is rented out, the rental income will belong to the person whose land interest is affected. 1 See \[19\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 59 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 5. For example, if a beneficiary of a trust has a right to the possession of the property, or if they in fact occupy it, they will have an interest in land as defined in the Act. A right to possession of land is specifically defined as an “interest in land” (s YA 1). Even if a beneficiary did not have the right to possession of the property, if they occupy it there will be, legally, what’s called a “tenancy at will”, 2 which gives rise to an interest in land. 3 The most common situation where a beneficiary will have an interest in the land is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. 6. Where a beneficiary has an interest in the land and they rent the property out to short-stay accommodation guests, it is their interest that is affected. It is their right to possession of the property, or their interest as tenant at will, that is impinged on by the property being rented out, not the trustees’ legal interest in the land. As such, if a beneficiary has an interest in the land and rents out all or part of the property for short-stay accommodation, the income will be theirs. This QWBA deals with situations where it is a beneficiary of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/16 deals with situations where it is the trustees of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. A beneficiary of the trust is renting out the property 7. As noted above, the most common situation where a beneficiary of a trust is deriving the short-stay accommodation income from renting out a property held in a trust, is where the property is the beneficiary’s home. Summary of the income tax implications 8. In this situation, it will be the beneficiary deriving the short-stay accommodation income because it is their interest in land that is affected by the property being rented out. 9. The beneficiary may be eligible to use a simplified method for meeting their tax obligations, known as the “standard-cost method”. This is discussed from \[17\]. Otherwise, the deductibility of the (non-capital) property-related expenses depends on whether the expense is incurred by the person deriving the income – in this case the beneficiary. Sometimes in a family trust situation this will not be the case. 10. In addition, while some expenses will be fully-deductible, others may be only partly deductible because they also relate to private use of the property. 11. Table 1 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in trust, where the income is derived by a beneficiary of the trust. 2 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 11.022, and The Laws of New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, “Lessor and Lessee” paras 108–112, and “Trusts” para 99. 3 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 10.010(c). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 60 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED TABLE 1: SHORT-STAY ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED IN TRUST PROPERTY THAT IS A BENEFICIARY OF THE TRUST’S HOME − INCOME DERIVED BY BENEFICIARY IncomeGenerally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the beneficiary. However, some amounts may be exempt. This will be the case: - if DET 19/02 (discussed below) is used; or - if DET 19/02 isn’t used and the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules) apply (see from \[14\]). Expenditure incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary OR Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary For the beneficiary • If the beneficiary pays all of the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use standard-cost determination DET 19/02. This is a simplified method for meeting the tax obligations for the short-stay accommodation activity. If DET 19/02 is used: - the short-stay accommodation income the beneficiary gets from the property is exempt up to the amount of the standard-costs; - only income over the amount of the standard-costs needs to be declared; - the beneficiary can’t deduct any of their actual expenditure, unless it’s for something not covered by the standard-costs and they have assessable income from providing the short- stay accommodation (ie, their income from providing the short-stay accommodation exceeds their standard-costs). If DET 19/02 isn’t used, the expenditure is deductible to the beneficiary, subject to apportionment for private use (usually as per QB 19/05). For the trustees • The amount of any expenses incurred by the trustees and paid by the beneficiary is rental income to the trustees. This will be cancelled out by the expenditure being deductible to the trustees because it’s incurred by them. If the trust is a “non-active trust” and has filed a non-active trust declaration (IR633), the trustees don’t need to file a return (s 43B of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Otherwise, the trustees do need to file a return and include the rental income and deduction. Expenditure incurred by and paid by trustees The expenditure is not deductible to anyone, unless the beneficiary pays rent to the trustees (including through reimbursement of the expense, on account of the right to use the property). The beneficiary’s income and deductions Income 12. Generally, all of the amounts received from paying guests will be income, and, for the reasons discussed at \[1\] to \[6\], the income is derived by the beneficiary. 13. The beneficiary may be eligible to use a simplified method (in DET 19/02) for meeting their tax obligations from providing the short-stay accommodation (discussed from \[17\]). If they use this method, some or all of the income will be exempt, and it will only be necessary to return income over a certain level. This reflects the typical costs incurred in providing short- stay accommodation in your home. 14. If DET 19/02 isn’t used and the MUA rules apply there may also be some exempt income. The MUA rules could apply, for example, if a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out, or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year (eg, if the beneficiary was away for an extended holiday and the home was unused during that time). 15. If the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income: • • amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, close relatives of the beneficiary such as their children, grandchildren, siblings or in-laws); and • • amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). What will be income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB 19/07. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 61 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Deductions 16. Often where a beneficiary’s home is held in a trust the beneficiary will pay all of the outgoings for the property, irrespective of who the expenses are legally incurred by (eg, rates, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and any loan repayments for the property). 17. Where the beneficiary’s home is used to earn short-stay accommodation income (ie, through renting out a room or the whole property from time to time) and the beneficiary pays all of the property-related outgoings, they may be eligible to use standard-cost determination DET 19/02. This is a simplified method for a taxpayer meeting their tax obligations from providing short-stay accommodation in all or part of their home. 18. If DET 19/02 is used, income up to the amount of set standard-costs is exempt. Only income in excess of the standard- costs needs to be returned. No deductions for expenditure actually incurred are allowed, unless the expenditure is for things not covered by the standard-costs in the determination. 19. If DET 19/02 isn’t used, non-capital property-related expenses the beneficiary pays will be deductible to the beneficiary, subject to appropriate apportionment for any expenses that don’t solely relate to the income-earning use of the property. Deductible expenses would include things like: • • interest payments; • • property and contents insurance premiums; • • rates; • • repairs and maintenance; • • utility bills; • • advertising costs; and • • any commission or fee the beneficiary pays to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform, just fees the beneficiary pays). 20. Expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the private use of the home and the rental activity – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 21. Generally, the appropriate basis for apportionment will be as discussed in QB 19/05. But in some situations a different basis may be required. For example, if a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home is rented out, or if the home is vacant for 62 days or more in the year (eg, if the beneficiary was away for an extended holiday and the home was unused during that time). In those situations, QB 19/06 explains how to work out which tax rules apply. If the MUA rules apply, there is a formula for apportioning expenses, and periods of private use (including use that gives rise to exempt income) will restrict the availability of deductions. If the MUA rules don’t apply, QB 19/06 will refer readers to the appropriate guidance on apportionment. 22. Depreciation losses on chattels in the property owned by the beneficiary and available for use by paying guests will also be deductible either in full or in part (depending on whether the chattels are used solely by paying guests). QB 19/05 explains how to calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is tax deductible (except if the home was vacant for 62 days or more in the year – in which case see QB 19/07). Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 23. If the rental activity is loss-making, the residential rental ring-fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act may potentially limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. 24. Those rules will often not apply where the property the beneficiary is renting out is their main home. However, the rules could apply in some situations, for example, if a principal settlor of the trust has a separate main home, or if the property the beneficiary is renting out is not their main home. 25. Any deductions that can’t be allocated to the year because of the ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next year the beneficiary derives residential income. 26. The ring-fencing rules will not apply if the short-stay accommodation is provided in a dwelling that is a mixed-use asset for the purposes of the MUA rules. For example, this could be the case for a separate dwelling (eg, a sleepout) on the same property as the beneficiary’s home. There are separate rules called the “expenditure quarantine rules” that may apply in this situation if the rental activity is loss-making – see QB 19/07. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 62 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 27. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019), from page 53. The trustees’ income and deductions 28. In the family home context, it’s likely that most of the property-related expenditure will be incurred by the beneficiary who lives there. However, some expenditure will be incurred by the trustees, for example, the rates and possibly property insurance. 29. Often the beneficiary who lives in the property will pay the property-related outgoings incurred by the trust as part of the arrangement that allows them to live in the property. The payment of those amounts by the beneficiary would be rental income to the trustees under s CC 1. 30. However, this rental income would be offset by the trustees being able to deduct the expenditure, as it’s incurred by them in deriving the rental income. 31. If the trust is non-active, the trustees may not need to file a tax return. A return would not be required if the trust: • • is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors); • • is a non-active trust; • • has submitted a non-active trust declaration (IR633) to Inland Revenue; and • • hasn’t stopped being a non-active trust since making the declaration. 32. Essentially, a trust will be a non-active trust if it hasn’t derived (or been deemed to have derived) any income for the year and doesn’t have any deductions for the year. There also can’t have been any transactions involving assets of the trust that give rise to income to any person, or to fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. 33. In determining whether a trust is “non-active”, the following payments aren’t taken into account (s 43B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994): (a) reasonable fees paid to professional trustees to administer the trust; or (b) bank charges or other minimal administration costs totalling not more than $200 in the tax year; or (c) interest earned on trust assets in any bank account during the tax year, to the extent to which the total interest does not exceed $200; or (d) insurance, rates, and other expenditure incidental to the occupation of a dwelling owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. \[Emphasis added\] 34. So if a beneficiary is paying the trustee-incurred outgoings for the property because they live there, while those amounts may technically be rent, if the trust doesn’t otherwise have income or make any payments other than those mentioned at \[33\], it may be able to submit a non-active trust declaration (see the requirements at \[31\]). If the trust meets the requirements and does this, the trustees won’t need to file a tax return so long as the trust continues to be non-active. 35. Trusts that aren’t non-active trusts will have to file a tax return. Example 1 explains what rental income the trustees will have and what deductions they can claim when a beneficiary lives in property held in the trust, uses it to provide short-stay accommodation, and pays the outgoings incurred by the trustees. Could s GC 5 apply to deem adequate rent to be paid from the beneficiary to the trust? 36. Section GC 5 is a provision in the Act that may apply where property is leased to someone who uses the property in deriving income. If no rent is payable by the lessee, or the rent is inadequate, s GC 5 could deem “adequate rent” to be paid by the lessee and derived by the lessor. 37. “Lease” is defined in s GC 5(5) as meaning a tenancy of any duration (it also includes a sublease or bailment). As noted at \[5\], where a beneficiary of a trust lives in property held in the trust, there will be a tenancy at will, which meets the definition of “lease”. 38. Section GC 5 will only apply to certain leases (listed in s GC 5(2)). This includes a lease by a person to a relative. “Relative” (defined in s YA 1) includes a person connected with another person by being the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefitted or is eligible to benefit. 39. So in a family trust situation, where a beneficiary is living in trust property and using it to derive income (eg, renting out a room for short-stay accommodation), s GC 5 could potentially apply to deem “adequate rent” to be paid by the beneficiary to the trust. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 63 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 40. However, the Commissioner would not apply s GC 5 in this situation. This is because s GC 5 is aimed at ensuring income can’t be assigned to someone else through leasing income-producing property to a relative or related company at a nominal rent. That mischief isn’t present in the trust context, where a trust can legitimately allocate any income as beneficiary income. The Commissioner will not use s GC 5 to deem there to be “adequate rent” paid for a lease in a situation where the lease isn’t creating an opportunity for a tax benefit through the shifting of income from one person to another. Provision of below market value accommodation to the beneficiary 41. If the trust is a complying trust (an ordinary New Zealand trust with New Zealand resident trustees and settlors), the trustees allowing a beneficiary to live in the trust-owned property rent-free or for less than market rent will be an exempt distribution from the trust (ss CW 53 and HC 20). However, if the trust is a foreign trust or a non-complying trust, this will be a taxable distribution from the trust, and not subject to the ordering rules (s HC 15(6)). As to the value of the distribution, see from \[8.6\] of IS 18/01: Taxation of Trusts. Example 1: Trust income and deductions when a beneficiary living in trust property pays property outgoings • • Rent from Harry and Theresa = $4,500 (rates and property insurance paid) • • Associated deductible expenses (incurred by trust): − rates $3,300 − property insurance $1,200 • • $10,000 income from other investments • • Airbnb income $5,000 • • Harry and Theresa pay these property outgoings (incurred by the trust): − rates $3,300 − property insurance $1,200 • • Other expenses/losses (incurred by Harry and Theresa): − loan interest − utility bills − contents insurance − Airbnb host service fees − depreciation losses for chattels used by guests • • Rates $3,300 • • Property insurance $1,200 Legal liability Rent $4,500 (payment of outgoings incurred by the trust) T Harry and Theresa pay these outgoings (incurred by the trust) Harry and Theresa’s home is held in a family trust. They settled the trust when they bought the home, and they are beneficiaries of the trust. They have a spare room and rent it out on Airbnb, earning $5,000 from this during the year. Because they live in the property, Harry and Theresa pay the following outgoings that are incurred by the trust: the rates ($3,300 for the year) and the property insurance ($1,200 for the year). Harry and Theresa have other expenses related to earning the Airbnb income: loan interest (the home loan is in their names), utility bills, contents insurance, and Airbnb host service fees. They also have depreciation losses for chattels in the home that guests can use. Because Harry and Theresa are paying the outgoings for the property that are incurred by the trust (the rates and property insurance), on the basis they can live there, those amounts would be rent to the trust. The trust can deduct the amount of the rates and property insurance because it has incurred them, having a legal liability to pay them. The result is that the rent and the deductions for the trust net off. However, the trust has $10,000 income from other investments so is not a “non- active trust”. As such, the trustees need to file a tax return, which will need to include the rental income and associated deductions (even though they net off). If Harry and Theresa meet the criteria to use Inland Revenue’s “standard-cost” determination (DET 19/02), they might choose to do that, to simplify their tax obligations. But otherwise, they’ll need to return all of the Airbnb income they receive, and can deduct a portion of the rates, property insurance and other expenses (and depreciation losses) they have. QB 19/05 will help them work out what proportion of their expenses they can claim as deductions.

This “Question We’ve Been Asked” (QWBA) explains how the income tax rules apply if property held in a trust is rented out by the trustees for short- stay accommodation (eg, through Airbnb, Bookabach or Holiday Houses). It will usually be the trustees renting out the property where the property is either a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or a property that’s sometimes rented out and sometimes used for other purposes (eg, it’s used by beneficiaries of the trust). Key terms Guest means a person provided with short-stay accommodation in return for payment. Renting out and similar terms are used in this QWBA to refer to granting a licence for the use of the property by short-stay accommodation guests. Short-stay accommodation means accommodation provided for up to four consecutive weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s ordinary residence. It doesn’t include accommodation provided to residential tenants, boarders or care home residents, and it doesn’t include student or emergency accommodation. Tr u s t is sometimes used in this QWBA as meaning the trustees of the trust, where this is helpful for simplicity. Question If property held in a discretionary trust is rented out by the trustees for short- stay accommodation, who should declare the income, and what deductions can be claimed? Answer If property is held in a discretionary trust and the trustees rent it out for short-stay accommodation (eg, a holiday home or dedicated short-stay accommodation rental property), the income belongs to the trustees, and will generally have to be declared in the trust’s tax return. However, some or all of the income may be allocated as beneficiary income, which would mean it’s taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate rather than at the trust rate. Non-capital costs 1 related to earning the income can be deducted. However, such costs will only be partly deductible where the expenditure also relates to private use or non income-earning use of the property. 1 See \[23\]. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 65 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Explanation Who is renting out the property? 1. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, rental income from land belongs to the owner of the land and they must declare it to Inland Revenue. 2. Owning land is not limited to having the legal title. Under the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act), someone will own land if they have an estate or interest in land. This could be freehold, leasehold, or any other interest in land. 3. Beneficiaries of a discretionary trust do not have an interest in the trust property simply by virtue of being beneficiaries. So in many situations where a property is held in a trust, it will be only the trustees, who legally own the land, who have an interest in the land. This will generally be the case, for example, for a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, or for a holiday home that is also sometimes rented out to third parties. Where only the trustees have an interest in the land, it will be the trustees renting out the property, and the rental income will belong to the trustees. 4. However, in some situations there will be different people with interests relating to the same underlying piece of land, and they will all be “owners” of land for income tax purposes. If this is the case, and the property is rented out, the rental income will belong to the person whose land interest is affected. 5. For example, if a beneficiary of a trust has a right to the possession of the property, or if they in fact occupy it, they will have an interest in land as defined in the Act. A right to possession of land is specifically defined as an “interest in land” (s YA 1). Even if a beneficiary did not have the right to possession of the property, if they occupy it there will be, legally, what’s called a “tenancy at will”, 2 which gives rise to an interest in land. 3 The most common situation where a beneficiary will have an interest in the land is where the property is the beneficiary’s family home. 6. Where a beneficiary has an interest in the land and they rent the property out to short-stay accommodation guests, it is their interest that is affected. It is their right to possession of the property, or their interest as tenant at will, that is impinged on by the property being rented out, not the trustees’ legal interest in the land. As such, if a beneficiary has an interest in the land and rents out all or part of the property for short-stay accommodation, the income will be theirs. This QWBA deals with situations where it is a trustees of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. QB 19/15 deals with situations where it is the beneficiary of the trust renting out the property for short-stay accommodation. Trustees of the trust renting out the property 7. The most common situations where trustees of a trust may rent out property for short-stay accommodation are where the property is: • • a dedicated short-stay accommodation property; or • • a family holiday home that’s also sometimes rented out. 8. In these situations, the income will usually belong to the trustees as they would usually be the only ones with an interest in the land. 9. There could be circumstances where this is not the case, for example, if a beneficiary has leased the property from the trustees, or if it can be shown that a beneficiary has been given the right to possession and use of the property. But the most common situation is that the income will belong to the trustees, so the following discussion is based on that being the case. 10. There are slight differences in the tax treatment where trustees of a trust are renting out property for short-stay accommodation, depending on which rules apply. Summary of the income tax implications 11. In the situation covered by this QWBA – where the trustees rent out the property – any income from renting the property out for short-stay accommodation will belong to the trustees and will need to be returned by them. 12. The deductibility of the (non-capital) property-related expenses depends on whether the expense is incurred by the person deriving the income – in this case the trustees. Sometimes in a family trust situation this will not be the case. 13. Although some expenses will be fully deductible, others may be only partly deductible because they also relate to private use or non income-earning use of the property. 2 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 11.022, and The Laws of New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, “Lessor and Lessee” paras 108–112, and “Trusts” para 99. 3 Hinde, McMorland & Sim, Land Law in New Zealand (online ed.), LexisNexis NZ Limited, at 10.010(c). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 66 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 14. Table 1 summarises the income tax implications for short-stay accommodation properties held in trust, where the income is derived by the trustees. TABLE 1: SHORT-STAY ACCOMMODATION PROPERTY — INCOME DERIVED BY THE TRUSTEES IncomeGenerally, all amounts received from paying guests are income to the trustees. However, if the property is subject to the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules) – see from \[15\], the following amounts are exempt income: • • amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, settlors and beneficiaries); and • • amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). Expenditure incurred by and paid by the trustees The expenditure is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. See from \[31\] for how to apportion expenditure for property subject to the MUA rules, or from \[35\] for property not subject to the MUA rules. Expenditure incurred by the trustees and paid by a beneficiary For the beneficiary The expenditure isn’t deductible to the beneficiary, as there is no connection between the expenditure and the beneficiary earning income. For the trustees • • The expenditure is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. • • But if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed by the trustees, the amount of the expense paid by the beneficiary is income to the trustees as either: - rental income under s CC 1, if paid by the beneficiary for use of and/or ability to use the property, provided the property is not subject to the MUA rules; or - income under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed, if not paid by the beneficiary for use of and/or ability to use the property, or if the property is subject to the MUA rules. The net effect of this is that if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed, the trustees don’t get the benefit of the deduction. This reflects that the trustees haven’t borne the expense. Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary • • If the trustees reimburse the beneficiary (by actual payment or through their ‘beneficiary current account’), this is deductible to the trustees. However, for properties that are also used for non income-earning purposes (eg, used by the beneficiaries of the trust), this is subject to apportionment. • • If the trustees don’t reimburse the beneficiary, the expense can’t be deducted by anyone. In this case, the amount may be rental income, and there may be a settlement on the trust by the beneficiary or a distribution to the beneficiary from the trust. The amount could only be rental income if the property is not subject to the MUA rules, and the beneficiary incurred the expense for the use of and/or ability to use the property. Whether there is a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust depends on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or ability to use the property they get in return for incurring those expenses. Which tax rules apply? 15. If the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (eg, a family holiday home that’s sometimes rented out), there are different rules that could apply to determine the precise tax treatment for the property – in particular what counts as income, and the proportion of the expenses that can be deducted. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 67 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 16. For these properties, the first step will be to work out which rules the property falls into for the particular year: • • the “mixed-use asset rules” (the MUA rules); or • • the standard tax rules. 17. QB 19/06 explains how to work out which rules apply for each income year. The factor that determines which rules apply is whether the property is unused for 62 days or more during a year. 18. If property is a mixed-use asset, there are some situations in which the taxpayer can choose to opt out of the tax rules. This is explained in QB 19/06. 19. It’s necessary to revisit which tax rules apply each year. The income is derived by the trustees 20. As noted above, where the trustees are the ones renting out the short-stay accommodation, the income will belong to the trustees. 21. Generally, all amounts the trustees receive from paying guests will be income. However, this doesn’t include minor contributions from family or friends who aren’t charged rent (eg, if they pay $20 towards their power usage). 22. In addition, if the MUA rules apply, the following amounts will be exempt income: • • amounts received for renting the property to associated natural persons (eg, the settlor and beneficiaries); and • • amounts received from renting the property at “mates’ rates” (less than 80% of the market value rent). What will be income or exempt income under the MUA rules is discussed in detail in QB 19/07. Expenditure incurred by the trustees is deductible to them 23. Because the rental income in this situation belongs to the trustees, non-capital property-related expenditure that’s incurred by the trustees will be deductible to them under s DA 1, subject to any apportionment required. These expenses could include things like: • • interest payments; • • property and contents insurance premiums; • • rates; • • repairs and maintenance; • • utility bills; • • advertising costs; and • • any commission or fee the trust pays to an advertising platform or transaction facilitator (this does not include any service fee the guests pay the platform, just fees the trust pays). 24. Expenses incurred by the trustees will be deductible to the trustees (subject to any apportionment), regardless of whether the expense is paid by the trustees or by a beneficiary. 25. Expenditure will be incurred by the trustees if they either paid or became definitively committed to the expenditure in the income year. 26. This would include where the trustees have incurred the obligation themselves (eg, rates and property insurance). It would also include situations where the trustees have agreed that they’ll reimburse a beneficiary for expenditure incurred by the beneficiary. For example, if a beneficiary gets the power, pay-TV or internet connected in their name (which would often be the case, as this would be easier than getting those services connected in the trustees’ names). In those situations, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. 27. It may be that someone who is a beneficiary of the trust is also a trustee, and connects services such as power or internet in their individual name. Generally, in this case the person would be incurring the expenditure in their capacity as trustee, so the expenditure would be incurred directly by the trustees. 28. Some or all of the rental income may be allocated as beneficiary income, which would mean it’s taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate rather than at the trust rate. However, for the purposes of determining the deductions the trust is allowed, the beneficiary income is treated as trustee income (s DV 9(2)). This means that all the non-capital expenses the trust incurs in relation to the rental activity will be deductible to the trustees, subject to any apportionment required. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 68 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Dedicated short-stay accommodation property 29. If the property is a dedicated short-stay accommodation property, the above expenses will be fully deductible; no apportionment is necessary. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels would also be fully deductible. A holiday home that is sometimes rented out 30. However, if the property is sometimes rented out and sometimes used by people associated with the trust (eg, a family holiday home that’s sometimes rented out), the proportion of the expenses that can be deducted will depend on whether the MUA rules or the standard tax rules apply (see from \[15\]). If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home 31. If the MUA rules apply to the holiday home, expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and “private use” of the property – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 32. Use by natural persons who are associated with the trustees counts as “private use” for the apportionment formula in the MUA rules. Use by anyone else for less than 80% market value rent (eg, friends staying and paying “mates’ rates”) will also be “private use”. 33. Persons associated with the trustee will (relevantly) be: • • beneficiaries of the trust; • • settlors of the trust; • • persons associated with beneficiaries of the trust under the “two relatives” test in s YB 4; and • • persons with a power of appointment or removal of trustees – unless within the exclusion for providers of professional services (s YB 11). The IR620 guide explains how to work out if someone is associated with the trustees. 34. QB 19/07 explains how to calculate the percentage of the mixed expenses that is tax deductible under the MUA rules. The same formula is generally used to calculate the portion of depreciation losses for the property’s chattels that is deductible. The exception to this is depreciation losses or depreciation recovery income on disposal, which is dealt with by the depreciation provisions in subpart EE. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home 35. If the standard tax rules apply to the holiday home, expenses that relate solely to the rental activity (eg, advertising fees) will be 100% deductible. But mixed expenses – those that relate to both the rental activity and non income-earning use of the property (eg, use by beneficiaries or settlors of the trust) – need to be apportioned. These mixed expenses would include things like rates, insurance, utility bills, and loan interest. 36. These mixed expenses will usually be deductible based on the total number of nights in the year the property is rented out or available to be rented out. The discussion and examples in QB 19/08 (from \[20\]) explain how to calculate the percentage of the mixed expenses that is tax deductible. Although QB 19/08 refers to expenditure not being deductible for “private use” (which a trust can’t have), the same approach can be used. This is because there will only be the required nexus between the expenditure and the earning of income to the extent the property is rented out or available to be rented out. 37. Depreciation losses on the property’s chattels will also be partly deductible. QB 19/08 explains how to calculate the percentage of depreciation losses that is tax deductible. Income to the trustees if beneficiary not reimbursed for paying trustees’ expense 38. For properties that are either dedicated short-stay accommodation properties or holiday homes that are sometimes rented out, the trust will likely have a bank account that guests pay into. Therefore, where the trustees have incurred an obligation themselves (eg, rates and property insurance), they will likely have the funds to pay the expense. 39. But if for whatever reason they didn’t, and a beneficiary pays the expense instead, the expense would still be deductible to the trustees as they have incurred the legal obligation. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 69 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED 40. However, if the trustees didn’t reimburse the beneficiary (either in cash or through the ‘beneficiary’s current account’), the amount of the expense paid by the beneficiary will be income to the trustees either: • • under s CC 1, if: –the amount is paid by the beneficiary for the use of and/or ability to use the property; and –the property is not subject to the MUA rules; or otherwise • • under s CG 4, to the extent of the deduction the trustees have been allowed. 41. The net effect of this is that if the beneficiary isn’t reimbursed, the trustees don’t get the benefit of the deduction. This reflects that the trustees haven’t borne the expense. Reimbursement of expense incurred by beneficiary 42. As noted above, it may be that a beneficiary (who is not also a trustee) incurs an obligation to pay some property-related expenses (such as power bills or internet), because it’s easier to have those services connected in an individual’s name. 43. Those expenses aren’t deductible to the beneficiary, as there’s no nexus between the expenditure and the beneficiary earning income. The income from the rental activity belongs to the trustees. 44. However, the trustees may have agreed that they’ll reimburse the beneficiary for this expenditure. If they have, the agreement to reimburse the beneficiary is an obligation incurred by the trustees. The trustees can therefore deduct the amount they reimburse the beneficiary (whether by actual payment or through the ‘beneficiary’s current account’), subject to any apportionment required (see from \[30\]). Expenditure incurred by a beneficiary and not reimbursed by the trustees 45. If a beneficiary has incurred a property-related expense that the trustees don’t reimburse them for, the expense can’t be deducted by anyone. 46. In this case the amount of the expense the beneficiary has paid will be rental income to the trustees, if: • • the amount is paid by the beneficiary for the use of and/or ability to use the property; and • • the property is not subject to the MUA rules. 47. There may also be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. Whether there is a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust, and the amount of any such settlement or distribution, will depend on the value of what the beneficiary and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. This includes the value of property-related expenses incurred by the beneficiary that are of value to the trust and the market value of any use of and/or ability to use the property they get in return for incurring those expenses. Allocation of deductions if the rental activity is loss-making 48. If the property is not within the mixed-use asset rules and the rental activity is loss-making, the residential rental ring- fencing rules in subpart EL of the Act may limit the deductions that can be allocated to the income year. Any deductions that can’t be allocated to the year because of the ring-fencing rules will be carried forward to the next year the trustees derive residential income. 49. There is more information about the residential rental ring-fencing rules in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019), from page 53. Examples Example 1: Trust income and deductions for a dedicated rental property The B-F Family Trust owns an investment property in Queenstown that’s rented out on Airbnb. The property isn’t used at all by the settlors (who are deceased) or beneficiaries of the trust – it’s a dedicated Airbnb rental property. The corporate trustee pays all of the property-related expenses from its bank account. This includes the power, internet and pay-TV bills. The connections for those services are in the names of Ani and Charlie, who are beneficiaries (but not trustees) of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Ani and Charlie’s names as this was easier. But there’s an agreement that the trustee will pay all those expenses. All of the rental income is income to the trustee. All of the (non-capital) property-related expenses are deductible to the trustee. This includes the power, internet and pay-TV bills, as the trustee pays those. Because the property is only used for rental purposes, the expenses are all fully deductible. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 70 QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN ASKED Example 2: Trust income and deductions for a holiday house that’s subject to the MUA rules The Fab Five Family Trust owns the Brown family’s holiday house. The Browns use the holiday house for 45 nights during the tax year. The trustees of the Fab Five Family Trust rent it out to friends of the Browns for 15 nights in the year for “mates’ rates” of $50 a night, and the trustees rent it out to others for 80 nights in the year for $200 a night. The trustees have used QB 19/06 to work out the holiday house is a mixed-use asset for the tax year. This is because it was: (a) used privately (by the Browns, who are beneficiaries and settlors of the trust, and by friends for less than 80% of the market value rent), (b) used to earn income, and (c) vacant for 62 days or more. Therefore, the MUA rules apply. The trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mrs Brown, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mrs Brown’s name as this was easier. But there’s an agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Brown have a loan (in their names, with a guarantee provided to the bank by the trustees) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Brown’s ‘beneficiary current accounts’. The rental income from the full-rate paying guests is income to the trustees. The $50 a night “mates’ rates” paid by the Browns’ friends isn’t income to the trustees – it’s exempt because it’s less than 80% of the market value rent. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to Airbnb and Bookabach, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the full-rate paying guests. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned under the formula in the MUA rules, as they relate to both the rental activity and the private use of the holiday home (by the Browns and their friends who pay less than 80% of market value rent). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay those, and the loan interest that the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Brown for. The trustees use QB 19/07 to work out the deductible portion of these mixed expenses. There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Brown and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement. Example 3: Trust income and deductions for a holiday house that is subject to the “standard rules” not the MUA rules The We Are Family Trust owns the Miller family’s holiday house in a popular tourist destination. The Millers use the holiday house for 90 nights during the tax year, and rent it out as short-stay accommodation for 220 nights in the year. The trustees have used QB 19/06 to work out the holiday house is not subject to the MUA rules for the tax year, so the “standard rules” apply. This is because the holiday house was not vacant for 62 days or more during the year. The short-stay accommodation guests pay into the trustees’ bank account, and the trustees pay most of the property-related expenses from their bank account. This includes the power, pay-TV and internet bills, even though the connections for those services are in the name of Mr Miller, who is a settlor and beneficiary of the trust. The connections were signed up for in Mr Miller’s name as this was easier. But there is an agreement that the trustees will pay those expenses. However, Mr and Mrs Miller have a loan (in their names) from when they bought the property and settled it on the trust, and they pay the loan repayments. The trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller for the interest component of the loan repayments. This is recorded in Mr and Mrs Miller’s ‘beneficiary current accounts’. The rental income from the short-stay accommodation guests is income to the trustees. Some of the trustees’ expenses are fully deductible. This includes the fees they pay to the Holiday Houses and Bookabach websites, which they advertise on, and the cost of cleaners who come in after the paying guests’ stays. Other expenses the trustees incur need to be apportioned, as they relate to both the rental activity and the non income- earning use of the holiday home (when it’s used by the Millers). These expenses include the power and internet bills, as the trustees pay those, and the loan interest that the trustees reimburse Mr and Mrs Miller for. The trustees use QB 19/08 to help them work out the deductible portion of these expenses. There may be a settlement on the trust or a distribution from the trust. This depends on the value of what Mr and Mrs Miller and the trust are providing each other under the arrangement.

STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS SPS 19/05: Options for relief from child support debt Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice for providing relief when the immediate payment of an overdue child support or domestic maintenance obligation is not possible. The relief is provided in the form of an agreement to pay the debt in instalments; writing off penalties in certain situations; or in limited circumstances, writing off part or all the child support debt. Inland Revenue may collect a debt owed by a receiving carer in the same manner as for financial support owed by a liable person. References to “liable person” may therefore include a receiving carer. All references to child support debt or a child support obligation are to be read as including a domestic maintenance debt or obligation unless otherwise noted. All references are to the Child Support Act 1991 (the “Act”), unless otherwise stated. The relevant legislative provisions of the Act are set out in Appendix 1. Application This Statement applies from the date of signing. It replaces SPS 11/02 Child Support debt – Requesting an instalment arrangement that was issued on 16 February 2011. This Statement does not extend to other tax debt or student loan arrears. For more information on these, see SPS 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt and SPS 11/03 Student Loans – Relief from repayment obligations or any statements issued in replacement. Standard practice Summary 1. This Statement applies to the Commissioner’s discretion to provide relief when considering requests for payment agreements to settle child support debt. 2. The Act provides limited discretion when a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt in full and on time. A liable person is encouraged to contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible if they think that they may have trouble paying their child support obligations. We can then discuss options for payment, which may include a payment agreement and/or writing off penalties (in full or in part). 3. Although it is best to contact Inland Revenue before getting behind with child support payments, it is never too late to discuss the options for resolving child support debt and minimising related penalties. 4. Requests for a payment agreement may be made in writing, by telephone, or any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner – for example, through myIR secure online services at www.ird.govt.nz 5. Requests for financial relief will be considered on a case-by-case basis. A liable person will need to be able to show why they cannot make immediate payments towards their child support obligation. They may be asked to supply further information about their financial circumstances in support of their request for a payment agreement. 6. If the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is not able to make immediate payment, a payment agreement may be agreed to. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 73 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 7. A payment agreement will be for more than the annual assessed amount of child support payable. This is because payment agreements must include the annual assessed rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the child support debt. 8. A payment agreement will be structured so that the child support debt will be paid in the shortest possible time. 9. When the Commissioner agrees to a payment agreement, the terms will be confirmed and both the liable person’s and the Commissioner’s obligations under the payment agreement will be set out. For liable persons with a myIR Secure Online Services account, confirmation may be made electronically. 10. A liable person who enters into a payment agreement should inform the Commissioner as soon as possible if there is a change to their circumstances that may affect: • • an earlier decision to provide financial relief; or • • their ability to repay their child support debt. 11. In certain circumstances, the initial late payment penalty and/or incremental penalties that were incurred prior to a payment agreement being made may be written off. 12. When a payment agreement has been made, the Commissioner will provide relief to the liable person from ongoing incremental penalties for a particular month if all the payments that are due in that month are made. 13. Missing payments of an instalment may not undo the overall payment agreement. When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt under a payment agreement, the terms of the payment agreement may be changed at the request of the liable person. 14. However, when a payment agreement is cancelled because a liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations, the Commissioner will consider whether other options may be available to collect the child support debt. Penalties will accrue on any unpaid amount. 15. Where a liable person has defaulted on child support obligations, the Commissioner will look to make automatic deductions from their salary/wages or benefit income, as generally required under ss 130 and 131. Detailed Discussion 16. A liable person should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible if they think they are unable to pay their child support obligations on time and in full. Options for payment, which may include a payment agreement, can be discussed. The Commissioner will consider requests for relief on a case-by-case basis. Early contact may also minimise penalties where a payment agreement can be entered into. 17. Applications may be made by telephone, in person, in writing or by electronic means. Details on contact methods for Child Support are available at: www.ird.govt.nz/contact-us Available options for relief 18. The Commissioner may, when satisfied that immediate payment of child support debt is not possible, grant relief to a liable person by: • • agreeing to a payment agreement; • • in some instances, being able to grant relief from initial late payment penalties and/or incremental late payment penalties; or • • writing off part or all of the debt to the extent it is child support that was payable in respect of a period in which the receiving carer was a social security beneficiary (Crown entitlement) and payment will place the liable person in serious hardship. 19. Mandatory relief is also available for initial late payment penalties charged on the first payment due, if a payment arrangement is entered into, or a deduction notice is issued, (which includes that first payment), within 3 months of the issue date of the first assessment. 20. Where a payment agreement is adhered to, a mandatory write-off of related incremental penalties will occur. When will relief be provided? 21. For the Commissioner to consider a payment agreement, she must be satisfied that the liable person is not able to make immediate payment of their child support debt. 22. The Commissioner will consider all options available for payment but will look for arrangements that will see this debt repaid in the shortest possible time while also ensuring the liable person maintains their current child support obligations. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 74 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Payment agreements 23. A payment agreement may consist of one or more payments to settle a child support debt. To ensure that the liable person meets their current child support obligations a payment agreement will include any current-year child support payable. 24. The liable person will be expected to meet their current-year child support obligations, as well as providing a reasonable amount toward reducing the outstanding debt. Information to support application 25. The Commissioner’s decision on whether to agree to a payment agreement will be based on the circumstances of each case, with the aim of recovering the child support debt in the shortest possible time. The Commissioner will also consider whether the liable person can reasonably afford to pay their child support debt at the rate proposed in their payment agreement application. 26. The liable person may be asked to provide information to support their application for a payment agreement, including their proposed payment plan. Alternatively, they may be asked to complete a Child support – repayment of arrears (IR130) form. The information provided will be used to assist the Commissioner in considering the application and to determine whether the liable person has other options for settling their child support debt. The IR130 form is available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides 27. A liable person may ask for the payment agreement to be renegotiated at any time. Although the legislation does not prevent the Commissioner from reviewing a payment agreement at any time, generally the Commissioner will renegotiate a payment agreement only after two years from the date the agreement was entered into. This is to provide the liable person with some certainty as to the level of payments towards their child support debt. However, where the Commissioner becomes aware of a material change in the circumstances of the liable person, the Commissioner reserves the right to renegotiate the agreement at any time. Defaulting on instalments 28. Inland Revenue acknowledges that a liable person’s circumstances can change for reasons outside their control. For example, they may face an unforeseen household expense or default by debtors can erode their cash flow and affect their ability to maintain a payment agreement. 29. If this happens, the liable person should contact Inland Revenue promptly to discuss an adjustment to their payment agreement. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the liable person is unable to continue to meet their payment agreement, it may be re-negotiated or other options to recover the debt will be considered. 30. If a liable person does not comply with the terms of a payment agreement, the Commissioner may cancel that arrangement and look to collect the debt in another way. In considering whether to cancel the arrangement, where possible, the reasons for the default will be considered and the Commissioner will take into account the liable person’s overall child support compliance behaviour, including: • • regularity of payments; • • current financial circumstances; • • the circumstances under which the payments were missed; and • • the liable person’s cooperativeness and willingness to maintain current child support obligations and resolve their debt. 31. The Commissioner may also decline to enter into a payment agreement if the liable person has not complied with earlier agreements and there was no reasonable cause for the non-compliance. 32. The Commissioner may cancel a payment agreement if it was entered into on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the liable person. Charging of penalties 33. If child support obligations are not paid in full and on time, an initial late payment penalty is charged on the unpaid amount as follows: • • The greater of 2% of the unpaid amount or $5.00 is charged on the day after the due date; • • 8% of the unpaid amount (excluding the 2%) is charged 8 days after the due date. 34. Amounts remaining unpaid during the following 11 months will be charged an incremental late payment penalty of 2% each month. Amounts still unpaid after this will be charged a penalty of 1% each month. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 75 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Discretionary relief from penalties 35. When a liable person enters into a payment agreement, the Commissioner can grant the liable person relief from the payment of late payment penalties, either the initial or the incremental penalties (or both). The Commissioner can grant relief by writing off the whole or part of the penalty. Each of the write offs that may be available are discussed below. Incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into (s 135FA) 36. The Commissioner may grant relief in respect of incremental penalties that were unpaid at the time a payment agreement was entered into if she is satisfied that the recovery of those penalties would place the liable person in serious hardship, or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 37. The payment agreement must be entered into on or after 1 April 2016 and require the liable person to pay, in 1 sum or 2 or more instalments under a payment agreement, the amount of child support outstanding and the initial late payment penalties as well as any child support that the person will become liable to pay during the term of the payment agreement. 38. Before the Commissioner decides to grant relief due to serious hardship, she must have regard to the matters referred to in ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which pertain to protecting the integrity of the tax system and encouraging voluntary compliance. Incremental penalties where some or all of the debt paid (s 135G) 39. Where the liable person has paid some or all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties, the Commissioner may grant relief from the payment of the related incremental penalties if she is satisfied that the recovery of the penalties would place the liable person in serious hardship, or it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. Residual initial/incremental penalties (s 135GA) 40. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person from the payment of initial late payment penalties and/or incremental penalties if the liable person has paid or had written off all their financial support debt and the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of those penalties would place the person in serious hardship or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 41. Similarly, the Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person from the payment of initial late payment penalties and/ or incremental penalties if the Commissioner has written off some or all of the benefit component of an amount of child support that is payable by the person and the Commissioner is satisfied that the recovery of those penalties would place the person in serious hardship or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 42. In this instance the Commissioner must be satisfied that the penalties relate to, or arise from, some or all of the written-off benefit component. Determining serious hardship 43. In determining whether serious hardship exists, the Commissioner will consider whether the liable person will suffer significant financial difficulties that arise because: (a) the liable person would likely be unable to meet minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards; or (b) the liable person must meet the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the liable person, or their dependant; or (c) the liable person or their dependant has a serious illness; or (d) the liable person must meet the cost of education for their dependant. 44. Serious hardship does not include significant financial difficulties due to having to pay tax or child support, because the liable person may become bankrupt or that the person’s social activities and entertainment may be limited, or the liable person may not be able to afford expensive or high-quality goods or services. 45. The definition of serious hardship refers to “normal community standards”. While these standards must be considered in the context of the wider community of New Zealand, the actual expenditure of liable persons in different parts of the country may vary. When calculating a liable person’s minimum living expenses, the Commissioner will consider the reasonable costs of food, heating and accommodation in the liable person’s area, based on information provided by Statistics New Zealand. However, this is just a starting point and the Commissioner will have regard to expenditure incurred that is outside the norm due to the liable person’s specific circumstances. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 76 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 46. The definition of serious hardship also refers to a “dependant”. Whether a person is a liable person’s dependant will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Commissioner will consider whether the person depends on the liable person for financial support, what degree of financial support is provided, and to what extent providing financial support affects the liable person’s ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards. Fair and reasonable test 47. Whether it is fair and reasonable to write off incremental penalties depends on the circumstances of each case. Some of the factors that the Commissioner will consider include: • • whether the payment was late due to a circumstance beyond the liable person’s control, including medical or mental incapability, incarceration, hospitalisation, travel disruption, natural disasters, civil emergencies; • • whether the person generally has a good payment history; • • whether the person took reasonable steps to mitigate the debt; • • whether the person genuinely misunderstood the payment requirements; • • whether the person paid other debts or acquired assets in preference to paying financial support. Mandatory relief 48. Other provisions of the Act direct the Commissioner to grant relief from the payment of initial late payment penalties or incremental penalties if certain criteria are met. Full or substantial compliance with payment arrangement (s 135GB) 49. Where a liable parent has a child support debt that includes their first payment of child support and they entered into a payment arrangement after 1 April 2016 within 3 months of the date of the assessment, the initial late payment penalty will be written off if the arrangement is fully or substantially adhered to. 50. A payment arrangement includes a payment agreement, or a deduction notice issued under s 154. 51. A first payment is the first time a person is liable to make a payment of child support under a new liability. This includes when a liable person’s liability ceases then restarts at a later date (except when this is due to the person’s status changing between a person who is entitled to receive child support to being the person who is liable to pay). It does not include the situation where a liable person has an existing liability and they incur an additional liability, for example, the addition of a qualifying child. 52. An assessment may be a formula assessment, voluntary agreement or an order of the court. The payment arrangement needs to have been made within 3 months of the date the assessment is issued. 53. A payment arrangement has been fully or substantially complied with when: • • it has operated for a period that the Commissioner considers reasonable; and; • • there has been no default in the payments under the arrangement; or • • the only default is to an extent, or arising from a cause, that the Commissioner considers reasonable. 54. The extent of the default means the level or range of the default. Is the level or range of the default reasonable in the Commissioner’s opinion? This will depend upon the facts of each case. 55. A default that arises from a reasonable cause will include a default due to a cause beyond the control of the liable person such as a serious illness, accident or disaster. 56. The Commissioner considers that the payment arrangement has operated for a reasonable period when the first payment of child support that was due, is cleared by the arrangement. If the arrangement has been fully or substantially complied with over this time, then the initial late payment penalty can be written off. Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into on or after 26 September 2006 (s 135J) 57. The Commissioner must write off incremental penalties unpaid at the time a payment agreement is entered into if the liable person has complied with the payment agreement up to a particular review date. 58. Any payment agreement must require the liable person to pay the amount of the initial debt (child support plus initial late payment penalties) along with the amount of child support that the person will become liable to pay during the term of the agreement. 59. A review date will be set for a payment agreement. That review date will be at 26-week intervals from the date the liable person enters into the payment agreement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 77 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 60. A person has complied with the payment agreement up to a particular review date if the person has paid every instalment in full when required to by the agreement. 61. If a person has satisfied the criteria above, the incremental penalties will be written off proportionally to the amount of the initial debt that has been repaid over the last 26-week period. 62. In addition, if the liable person makes all the payments as agreed during the last month, the Commissioner must write off all the ongoing incremental penalties charged during that last month (s 135M). 63. When a liable person has not complied with a payment agreement, but the Commissioner is satisfied that the non- compliance was caused by: • • circumstances beyond that person’s control and a reasonable cause for the delay of payment; or • • the delay in payment of the debt was caused by an honest oversight, and there is no history of default with previous payments of financial support, and the oversight was corrected promptly; or • • the liable person had acted on in good faith, on an error made by Inland Revenue leading to the debt, and it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief; the incremental penalties may still be written off. 64. If a liable person has not complied with a payment agreement and has not contacted Inland Revenue to discuss options, it is likely that the payment agreement will be cancelled. Should a payment agreement be cancelled, incremental penalties will remain and continue to accrue on any unpaid child support debt. 65. After the payment agreement has been completed, and the child support debt and any initial late payment penalties have been paid, some incremental penalties may still remain. Those remaining incremental penalties may be written off (refer paragraph 38). Write-off of Crown entitlement (s180A) 66. Child support (not including domestic maintenance) will be payable to the Crown in respect of the period that the receiving carer is in receipt of a social security benefit. 67. A write-off of the amount of child support that is owed to the Crown may be available if the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of part or all of the amount will place the liable person in serious hardship and/or would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. 68. A liable person cannot request that their child support debt be written off because they consider that collection would be an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. That is a decision solely for the Commissioner to make under the duties charged to her under ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Other relief that may be available Reasonable cause (s 135B) 69. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the delay in payment was due to a reasonable cause and the liable person made payment of the debt as soon as practicable, relief may be granted. 70. Reasonable cause means an event or circumstance that is beyond the control of the liable person and includes a serious illness, an accident or a disaster. The Commissioner must be satisfied that it was the event or circumstance that caused a reasonable delay in the payment of the debt. Failure by another person to make deduction (s 135C) 71. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the circumstances that contributed to the delay in the payment of the debt were due to or caused directly or indirectly by the failure of any person to make a deduction as instructed by a notice issued by the Commissioner under Part 10 of the Act and the liable person has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of those circumstances, the Commissioner may grant relief if after having regard to the nature of those circumstances it would be fair and reasonable to do so. Honest oversight (s 135D) 72. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person if she is satisfied that the penalty arose due to an honest oversight and the person has no history of missing payments and the person paid the debt as soon as they became aware of the oversight. 73. Whether a liable person has a history of missing payments will be a matter of fact in each case. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 78 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Error made by Inland Revenue (s 135E) 74. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person if she is satisfied that the delay in payment which resulted in the penalty being applied was due to an error made by an officer of Inland Revenue and the person has acted in good faith and has altered his or her position in reliance on the error and it would be fair and reasonable to do so. Debt waived or uplifted (s 135F) 75. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the payee has waived the right to the payment to which the penalty relates or has uplifted the debt, relief may be granted if it would be fair and reasonable to do so. Reviewing a decision 76. If a liable person is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern and ask for the decision to be reviewed. 77. If a liable person is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue Complaints Management Service at www.classic.ird.govt.nz/contact-us/disputes-process/ complaints-process/complaints-process.html or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm).

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 83 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS Operational statements set out the Commissioner's view of the law in respect of the matter discussed. They are intended to be a preliminary view in the absence of a public binding ruling or an interpretation statement on the subject OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS OS 19/05: Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace – income tax (PAYE) and fringe benefit tax Operational statements set out the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. All legislative references in this Statement are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless specified otherwise. Introduction The Commissioner is aware that there has been significant uncertainty regarding whether employer-provided travel 1 from home to a distant workplace is subject to income tax, so PAYE must be deducted, or to fringe benefit tax (FBT). This Statement addresses whether this type of travel is subject to tax and outlines the approach to the tax treatment in this area which the Commissioner will, on a prospective basis, accept as correct. To reduce uncertainty and foster taxpayer compliance, the Commissioner has deliberately sought to take a pragmatic approach as far as this is possible within the law. In this Statement: • • employer-provided travel means: –travel an employer organises; –travel that an employee organises but an employer pays for; –travel that an employer reimburses an employee for; or –an allowance paid to an employee by their employer that is paid to cover the cost of travel to a distant workplace; • • home means a dwelling you use as a residence; • • hometown means the city or town where your home is located; and • • a distant workplace is a workplace that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee’s home. 2 When an employer physically provides the travel or pays for it directly, then that travel may be subject to FBT, which the employer must pay. If the employee is provided with an allowance or is reimbursed in relation to the cost of the travel, then the employer may have to deduct and pay PAYE in relation to that payment. We are aware that many employers and employees are uncertain about when employer-provided travel to a distant workplace is subject to tax. Indeed, some employers have been treating all employer-provided travel to a distant workplace as not taxable. This Statement addresses that uncertainty by setting out the Commissioner’s approach to determining whether employer- provided travel from home to a distant workplace is subject to either income tax or FBT or not taxed. Summary of approach 1. Payments made by an employer in relation to a private expense of an employee are usually subject to tax. The cost of home-to-work travel is generally private expenditure as it is incurred so an employee can get to work. As this expenditure is usually private, if the employer provides 3 the employee’s travel from home to work the starting point is that it is taxable. 1 Travel can be, for example, by car, taxi, plane, bus or train. 2 See also “Guidance on ‘Reasonable Daily Travelling Distance’”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009): 6; www.classic.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/general-articles/leg-2009guidance-reasonable-distance.html 3 In the context of this Statement, “provides” includes pays for directly or indirectly, including by way of a reimbursement or allowance. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 84 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS Inland Revenue’s approach Employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace will be taxable (and subject to FBT or income tax) unless one of the following applies: • • the travel is one-off or very occasional (de minimis applies); • • the travel relates to a temporary posting or secondment (up to two years); • • the employee also genuinely works at a hometown workplace; • • the employee works from home on specified days (home being their place of work on those days, and the travel relates to one of those days). 2. However, the courts have recognised that some travel from home to work is not taxable because the expenditure relates to travel that is “on work”. 3. This means not all employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to work is taxable, and an employer who provides travel from home to a distant workplace must consider whether that travel is subject to tax. 4. Where an employer physically makes available or directly pays for an employee’s travel from home to a distant workplace, the travel may be subject to FBT, which the employer must pay. 5. If the employee is provided with an allowance or is reimbursed in relation to the travel, that amount may be subject to income tax. If an allowance or reimbursement is taxable for income tax purposes, then the employer must deduct and pay PAYE in relation to that payment. This is because the allowance or reimbursing payment would be “salary or wages” under the PAYE rules. 6. It does not matter whether you are considering whether employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace is subject to FBT or income tax, the test is still effectively the same. 7. We recognise that it can be difficult to determine whether travel provided to employees to enable them to travel to a distant workplace is subject to tax. The following paragraphs set out the Commissioner’s approach to determining whether employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is subject to tax. Application of the Statement 8. The Commissioner is aware that there has been significant uncertainty regarding employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace, in relation to both the correct interpretation of the law and the appropriate practice. Consequently, the Commissioner has developed an approach to the tax treatment in this area which she will, on a prospective basis, accept as correct. In an effort to reduce uncertainty and foster taxpayer compliance, the Commissioner has deliberately sought to take a pragmatic approach as far as this is possible within the law. 9. Therefore, recognising that some taxpayers may need time to implement this approach the Commissioner does not expect taxpayers to apply this Statement to travel taken before 1 April 2020. However, taxpayers can choose to begin applying the approach outlined in this Statement from the date it is issued if they wish to. 10. Given the uncertainty that has existed, taxpayers do not need to revisit tax positions taken before publication of this Statement, and (in the absence of identified avoidance) the Commissioner will not be doing so. 11. The approach outlined in this Statement does not apply where the travel arrangements have been entered into with a purpose of avoiding tax. 12. When considering the tax treatment of employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace, to the extent that there is inconsistency between this Statement and the Interpretation Statement IS3448 Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications, the approach in this Statement is to be followed. Discussion 13. As noted above, if the employer provides the employee’s travel from home to work, the starting point is that it is taxable as either: • • income to the employee, so subject to PAYE (see from \[14\]); • • a fringe benefit subject to FBT (see from \[25\]). PAY E 14. Payments made by an employer to reimburse an employee for that employee’s private expenditure are generally taxable as income of the employee. This is because these payments reduce the need for the employee to incur those costs themselves. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 85 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 15. When a reimbursement or allowance is taxable it is included as salary or wages for the purposes of the PAYE rules (s RD 5(8)). This means PAYE must be deducted and paid by the employer to Inland Revenue for that reimbursement or allowance. 16. When a reimbursement or allowance is paid to cover costs for which the employee would be allowed a deduction if the employment limitation on deductions did not exist, then it is not subject to income tax (s CW 17). This means the employer would not have to pay PAYE to Inland Revenue in respect of that reimbursement or allowance. 4 17. Therefore, the issue is whether the cost of the particular travel from the employee’s home to a distant workplace would be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). 18. A deduction is allowable for expenditure incurred in deriving income or necessarily incurred in the course of carrying on a business for that purpose (s DA 1). But expenditure that is of a private or domestic nature is not an allowable deduction (s DA 2(2)). 19. The general rule is that home-to-work travel is private expenditure as it is expenditure to get to work and reflects the employee’s personal choice as to their home location. 5 The two main reasons for this rule are that the: • • cost of home-to-work travel is predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work); • • expense of commencing work is distinguished from expenses while “on work”, and employees are expected to bear the cost of commencing work. 20. This means the starting point is that employer-provided travel from home to work is private expenditure and would not be deductible to the employee (if employees could claim deductions). This is the case even if the employee’s travel is funded by the employer or the employee’s attendance at the workplace is required by the employer. 21. The courts have recognised exceptions to this general rule. 6 The cases relating to deductibility of travel expenditure between home and work have identified four broad factual situations where travel between home and work is regarded as business or work-related travel. These situations are where: • • a vehicle is essential for transporting goods or equipment necessary for the performance of employment duties at the home and elsewhere; • • the taxpayer carries on an “itinerant occupation” (that is, the taxpayer does not work from a fixed work place, and the home is the taxpayer’s base of operations); • • the taxpayer is required to be accessible at their home for employment duties and is required to undertake travel in response to emergency calls; • • the travel is “on work” travel between two workplaces, one of which is also the taxpayer’s home. 22. It can be seen from the cases that for home-to-work travel to be deductible, the employee must actually undertake work at home. 23. It is not sufficient to establish that the home is or can be a workplace. For expenditure to be deductible, the need for the work to be performed at the home, and, therefore, the need for the travel, must arise from the nature of the work and not from the personal choice or personal circumstances of the taxpayer. 24. In addition, the actual travel must be travel undertaken in the course of performing work (that is, the travel is “on work”). If that is the case, then the cost of that travel is not private expenditure of the employee; rather, it is expenditure that would be deductible if employees were not otherwise prevented from claiming deductions. This means the employer does not have to deduct PAYE in respect of the reimbursement or allowance, and the employee is not liable for income tax on the payments. 7 , 8 4 Operational Statement OS 19/04b: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for employee reimbursement of a motor vehicle explains the acceptable method to establish the tax-exempt portion of an amount paid to an employee as a reimbursement where the employee uses their private motor vehicle in the employer’s business. 5 See, for example, Ricketts v Colquhoun \[1926\] AC 1. 6 See Taylor v Provan \[1975\] AC 194; Garrett v FCT 82 ATC 4,060; FCT v Genys 87 ATC 4,875; Case F72 (1984) 6 NZTC 59,924; Miners v Atkinson \[1995\] STC 58; Kirkwood v Evans \[2002\] STC 231. 7 To the extent that the payments are a reimbursement of actual costs or an allowance paid to cover the costs of the travel when the employee incurs the costs themselves. If amounts in excess are received by the employee, the excess amount is taxable. 8 See Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications (Interpretation Statement IS3448, Inland Revenue, 2004), which discusses the question of determining deductibility of home-to-work travel generally. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 86 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS Fringe benefit tax 25. Where an employer provides travel from a person’s home to their workplace (other than by way of a motor vehicle), the position is that this “benefit” amounts to a “fringe benefit” as it is an “unclassified benefit”. 9 26. This travel will be subject to FBT unless one of the exclusions applies. 27. The Commissioner considers that the only exclusions that might apply in respect of employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace are: • • benefits provided instead of exempt allowances (s CX 19); and • • benefits provided to enable the performance of duties (s CX 20). 28. Benefits are not fringe benefits to the extent that they replace the need to pay certain exempt allowances (s CX 19(1)). 29. Travel provided by the employer will not be a fringe benefit where that travel is necessary for an employee to undertake their employment duties (s CX 20). 30. It could be argued that travel from home to work is travel that is necessary for an employee to undertake their employment duties. However, s CX 20 implicitly adopts the distinction between travel “on work” and travel “to work”, with s CX 20 relating to circumstances where an employee is travelling “on work”. The purpose behind the original predecessor to s CX 20 was to exclude from FBT incidental benefits arising to an employee as a result of travelling in the course of their employment and was not intended to exclude home-to-work travel from the coverage of FBT. 31. The Commissioner considers that whether these exemptions apply to employer-provided travel is determined by applying the same test as the one used for determining whether employer-provided travel is subject to income tax, and, therefore, salary and wages for PAYE purposes. 32. This means employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace will be subject to FBT unless the: • • need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel itself) arises from the nature of the work; and • • travel itself is actually “on work”. Motor vehicles 33. A fringe benefit arises in relation to a motor vehicle made available to an employee for private use (s CX 6). This Statement does not replace the FBT on motor vehicle rules. 10 34. However, determining whether travel in an employer-provided motor vehicle from home to a distant work location is private use can be relevant in determining whether a motor vehicle was available for private use and therefore a benefit to the employee under those rules. 35. Using an employer-provided motor vehicle for travel between home and work will not be private use of that motor vehicle for FBT purposes if the: • • need for the work to be performed partly at the home (and, therefore, the need for the travel itself) arises from the nature of the work; and • • travel itself is actually “on work”. 11 36. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that the approach in this Statement can be used in determining whether using an employer-provided motor vehicle (for example, a rental car) to travel from home to a distant workplace is work-related travel and not private use. 37. Note that even if travel between home and work is work-related travel (so that the use of a motor vehicle for that purpose is not private use), the employer must establish that the vehicle is not available for any private use. 12 9 Travel by employer-provided motor vehicle is discussed from \[33\]. 10 As set out in further detail in Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles (Interpretation Statement IS 17/07, Inland Revenue, 2017). 11 Using an employer-provided motor vehicle to travel between home and work is discussed in more detail in Travel by Motor Vehicle between Home and Work: Deductibility of expenditure and FBT Implications (Interpretation Statement IS3448, Inland Revenue, 2004). 12 How FBT applies to motor vehicles is discussed in further detail in Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles (Interpretation Statement IS 17/07, Inland Revenue, 2017). In the context of determining whether travel from home to a distant workplace is private use, to the extent that there is inconsistency between this Statement and IS 17/07, the approach in this Statement is to be followed. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 87 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS When employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace is not subject to tax 38. We acknowledge that in the modern working environment employees have more flexibility around where they can live and work than in earlier times. As a result, it can be difficult and costly to determine whether employer provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is subject to tax. 39. Bearing that in mind and taking into account the legislation, the case law and the Commissioner’s care and management duties under ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner has developed an approach to make it easier to determine whether employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace is taxable. 40. In arriving at this approach, the Commissioner considered it appropriate to treat temporary travel to a distant workplace as different from more longterm travel arrangements. This is because we recognise that where the requirement for the travel is a temporary one, the cost of the travel is less likely to have been predominantly determined by the private choices of the employee (where to live, how to get to work). Where the travel is temporary, an employee is less likely to have the ability to mitigate the costs arising from the requirement to work at a distant location (by relocating). 41. In relation to determining whether accommodation is subject to tax, Parliament introduced clear rules that treat an arrangement where accommodation is provided for two years or less as temporary. While similar rules have not been enacted in relation to travel, how these rules apply to accommodation at a distant workplace does provide a useful indication of what Parliament considered was an appropriate line to draw between temporary and more permanent arrangements in relation to working at a distant workplace. Summary of approach 42. In summary, the Commissioner’s approach is that travel from home to a distant workplace that is provided by the employer will be taxable (and subject to FBT or income tax) unless one of the following applies: • • the travel is one-off or very occasional (de minimis); • • the travel relates to a temporary posting or secondment (up to two years); • • the employee also genuinely works at a local workplace (meaning they have two workplaces); • • the employee works from home on specified days and the travel relates to one of those days. One-off or very occasional travel 43. Inland Revenue considers that one-off or very occasional travel from home to a distant location for work (when required by the employer) can be treated as not taxable on an incidental or de minimis basis. For example, attendance at a two-day conference at a distant location. 44. This approach will apply to employees who work at an office of their employer located in their hometown as well as employees who work all the time from their home. Temporary travel 45. More frequent or ongoing employer-provided travel from home to a distant workplace (when the employer requires the travel) can be treated as non taxable where the requirement for travel is a temporary requirement (which means for a period of two years or less). An example might be a posting or secondment to another office or a client’s premises for a 12-month term (see Example 1). 46. To treat the travel as temporary the employer must be able to show that the parties reasonably expected that the requirement for the travel was for two years or less. Reasonable expectation is initially measured at the time the requirement for the travel arose. The parties’ expectation may be evidenced by the employee’s terms of employment, but in many cases there may not be a written agreement. Other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents, and correspondence may demonstrate the expectation as to length of the secondment. 47. It is possible that travel which is treated as non-taxable can become taxable. If it becomes clear that there is now a reasonable expectation that the requirement for travel is no longer a temporary requirement (for a period of two years or less) that travel will be taxable going forward from the date the expectation changed. 13 48. Equally, if it becomes clear that a requirement for travel which was expected to be more than a temporary requirement is now expected to be a temporary requirement (a period of two years or less) then that travel can be treated as non-taxable from the date the expectation changed. 13 Not from the end of the original date of the arrangement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 88 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS Example 1: Temporary travel Robyn lives in Auckland but is seconded to a job in Wellington for 12 months. Robyn’s employer agrees to meet the costs of Robyn flying between Auckland and Wellington (and back) every week as well as taxis to and from the airport. As the secondment is for two years or less (in this case, 12 months) any employer-provided travel from home to the distant location can be treated as non-taxable. Example 2: Temporary travel After 11 months Robyn and her employer agree that she will continue to work in Wellington for another sixteen months. As it is now expected that Robyn will be working in Wellington for more than two years (27 months in total) the travel can no longer be treated as temporary and will be taxable from the date the expectation changed. Ongoing travel from home to a distant workplace 49. Ongoing employer-provided travel from an employee’s home to a distant workplace will be taxable when the travel is for more than two years. This is because Inland Revenue considers that at that stage the arrangement for the travel is more than temporary. (See Example 3.) Example 3: Ongoing travel from home to a distant workplace Rudolf is a senior manager in a multinational company with its head office in Auckland. Rather than move his family to Auckland, Rudolf negotiated an arrangement whereby his employer provided him with an apartment in Auckland and flies him to Auckland on Monday morning and flies him to Wellington on Friday afternoon. As well as the cost of flights, his employer also covers the cost of his taxi travel to and from Auckland and Wellington airports. The arrangement is for more than two years, so this employer-provided travel is taxable. The outcome would be the same if Rudolf were seconded to the job in Auckland for a period greater than two years (rather than permanently appointed). 50. This approach applies except where the employee has at least two workplaces. Travel between multiple workplaces 51. As noted above, the courts have recognised that travel between two workplaces is not private expenditure when the employer requires that travel. Therefore, where an employee has two (or more) workplaces that they work from, one in their hometown and one distant, the Commissioner considers that the travel from the employee’s home to the distant workplace can be treated as work-related travel (being travel between multiple workplaces) and not taxable (the “multiple workplace approach”). 52. The Commissioner does not require an employee to be travelling from their workplace in their hometown to the distant workplace before treating the travel as being between multiple workplaces. This means the multiple workplace approach can apply when an employee instead travels directly from their home to a distant workplace. The Commissioner has taken this approach to recognise the travel between the multiple workplaces and, at the same time, minimise taxpayer compliance costs. An employer’s workplace in their hometown can still be a workplace of that employee for the purposes of this approach, even if most of the employee’s working week is spent at a distant workplace. (See Examples 4 and 5.) Example 4: Travel between multiple workplaces Jim is employed as a specialist to provide ongoing advice to senior managers. The job was advertised as being based in Wellington, but Jim was not interested in working full time in Wellington because his family lives in Auckland. Jim and the employer agree that Jim can work two days a week in Auckland at the Auckland office and three days a week in Wellington. The employer provides Jim with the travel between his home and the Wellington office. Jim’s travel from home to the Wellington office and back will be travel between two workplaces and not subject to tax. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 89 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS Example 5: Travel between multiple workplaces Charlotte is a manager based in Nelson. She has staff based throughout the country that she visits regularly. She is often required to be in Wellington for meetings. The travel in question is the travel from her home in Nelson to the distant location(s) and back again. Charlotte’s travel to the distant workplaces will be travel between two (multiple) workplaces and not subject to tax. If Charlotte were to use an employer-provided car (such as a rental) to undertake that travel between home and a distant workplace, as the Commissioner is treating the travel as travel between two workplaces it would not be private use for the purposes of determining whether the car was available for private use. Whether home is a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplaces approach 53. If an employee does not have a workplace that is local to their home, then the travel to a distant workplace can still be travel between two workplaces, but only if their home can be considered to be a workplace. 54. Under the approach outlined in this Statement, the Commissioner will accept that in relation to travel, home can be a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. But whether home is actually a workplace depends on the arrangement entered into between the parties, and an employee does not have multiple workplaces just because they can choose to work at home from time to time. 55. The Commissioner notes that by accepting that home could be a workplace in the context of travel to a distant workplace, she is taking a more concessionary approach than Parliament has taken in relation to the question of multiple workplaces and accommodation. Accommodation that an employer provides or pays for can be exempt where the employee has multiple workplaces (section CW 16F). However, where the employee has only two workplaces and one of them is a home office, this approach cannot apply. 56. While home may be a workplace, it is also the employee’s home, so it is easy for the line between home-to-work travel and “on-work” travel to become blurred. This raises the question as to what extent does working from home convert that home to being a workplace for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. 57. In considering whether a person is travelling between two workplaces when they travel from home to a work location, the courts have said it is not enough that a person can work at home. The courts tend to treat the place where you live as private and require an explicit and demonstrable distinction to exist before treating where you live as anything other than your home. 58. The Commissioner also requires such an explicit and demonstrated connection with home as a workplace on any particular day. If this were otherwise, then a “tainting” issue would arise as to what portion of time working at home in a week would be sufficient for home to be treated as a workplace for the whole week. There is no legal basis for the selection of any particular proportion, and the Commissioner does not believe that the courts would support such an outcome. 59. Accordingly, the Commissioner’s position is that, for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach, home should be regarded as a workplace in this context only in relation to the days where home is contractually and actually the employee’s usual place of work. 60. For an employee whose arrangement requires that they work at home on every working day, home is clearly a workplace. 61. Where an employee’s employment arrangement requires that their home is their formal workplace where they are expected to work on specified days (such as every Monday and Tuesday), their home will be their workplace on those days for the purposes of the multiple workplace approach. However, their home is still home on the other days, and travel from home to a distant workplace in relation to the other days is travel from home to work and is taxable. 62. For a home to be a workplace on any day, the arrangement with the employer must provide that it is a specified day where the employee is required to work at home, rather than the employee simply having the potential to work at home on that day. 63. Where travel from the home to the distant workplace relates to a “working from home day” (being a day when home is a workplace), this travel will be treated as travel between multiple workplaces. 64. On other days, home is still regarded as home, so the travel from home to a distant workplace will generally still be taxed on the basis that it is home to work travel. 65. The Commissioner recognises that this approach could be seen as a constraint on the parties’ contracting arrangements or as a compliance cost. However, she considers it a necessary part of the approach being taken, which is itself an attempt to minimise compliance costs. (See Examples 6–9.) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 90 OPERATIONAL STATEMENTS 66. It is important to note that when applying the Commissioner’s approach outlined in this Statement, whether home is a workplace only becomes relevant in determining whether the multiple workplace approach applies. Example 6: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when person is contracted to work from home full time Under Adele’s employment arrangement, she is contracted to work at home on a full-time basis. This means home is usually her sole place of work. Therefore, it can be considered to be her workplace on every work day. As any employer-provided travel from Adele’s home to a distant workplace (for example, for a specific meeting or purpose) is very occasional or could be considered to be one-off, it is not subject to tax. Example 7: Multiple workplace approach - Whether a person has multiple workplaces Ruby lives in Auckland and works for a government agency. She has a permanent working arrangement where she works Monday and Tuesday at home. On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, Ruby works at the agency’s Auckland office. Ruby is seconded to work on a 26-month project that requires her to work in Wellington on Thursday and Friday. As the project is for more than two years, the key question is whether Ruby has at least two workplaces so that the multiple workplace approach applies. As Ruby normally works in the Auckland office on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, any employer-provided travel from Ruby’s home to Wellington in relation to her work in Wellington would be treated as travel between multiple workplaces (the Auckland office and the Wellington workplace). Therefore, the multiple workplaces approach would apply in relation to this particular employer-provided travel and it would not be subject to tax. Example 8: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when a person is permitted to work at home Leo lives in Tauranga but the company he works for is based in Auckland. Under his employment contract Leo can work up to two days a week at home in Tauranga. The days that Leo works at home can vary depending on personal and business convenience. Leo’s employer provides him with travel between his home in Tauranga and the Auckland office in the form of plane flights and connecting taxis. This is an ongoing arrangement, so the main question is whether Leo has at least two workplaces so that the multiple workplace approach applies. It is important to determine whether Leo’s home is a workplace. Leo does not have specified days where he works at home, which means the Commissioner will not accept that his home is a workplace for any particular day, for the purposes of the multiple workplaces approach. Therefore, as Leo only has one workplace (the Auckland office) the multiple workplace approach does not apply in relation to this employer-provided travel, which is subject to tax. (If Leo and his employer had a different arrangement where Leo had specified days where he was required to work from home (for example, Monday and Tuesday), then home would be accepted to be Leo’s workplace on those days.) Example 9: Multiple workplace approach - Whether home is a workplace when a person is required to work at specified places on different days Phil is contracted on an ongoing basis to work Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at his home and Thursday and Friday at a distant workplace. This ongoing arrangement is expected to last for more than two years. Therefore, the key question to answer when determining whether this travel to a distant workplace is taxable is whether Phil has at least two workplaces (the possibilities are home and the distant workplace) so that the multiple workplace approach applies. It is important to determine whether home is a workplace. In this circumstance, home is clearly a workplace on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and employer-provided travel to the distant workplace relating to those days will not be taxable. An example of this would be attendance at a conference or meeting on one or more of those days. But on Thursday and Friday Phil does not work from his home, so home is still his home for these purposes on those days. Consequently, employer-provided travel from home to the distant workplace will be travel from home to work (and taxable) when it is undertaken for the purpose of getting Phil to that distant location, so he can work there on Thursday and/or Friday. This means employer-provided travel from his home to a distant workplace on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday will be taxable, if the travel is undertaken so Phil can undertake his work on Thursday and Friday.

High Court upholds TRA decision regarding Income Tax, GST and PAYE assessments and TAA ss 108 and 108A time bar Case Dowden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 2729 Decision date24 October 2019 Act(s)Income Tax Acts 1994, 2004 & 2007; Student Loan Scheme 1992; Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 108 and 108A. Keywordsfraudulent, wilfully misleading, knowingly Summary This is an appeal from a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) regarding Mr Dowden’s challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“Commissioner”) PAYE, GST and INC assessments for tax periods between January 2004 and May 2012. These assessments concerned several businesses run by Mr Dowden, including Safeguard Security (“Safeguard”). Mr Dowden claimed to have transferred his interest in Safeguard to his former partner, Ms Jackson, in December 2003. Mr Dowden’s case was that Ms Jackson was liable for tax relating to Safeguard between January 2004 and December 2011. The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessments. The TRA held that Mr Dowden had not ceased to trade as Safeguard from January 2004 to December 2011 and also that the Commissioner was not bound by the limitation periods in ss 108 and 108A of the TAA. Impact The decision reaffirms the TRA’s entitlement to determine the weight to place on evidence where the witness was not available for cross-examination and that it is not required to disregard entirely, the conflicting statements of a witness. The decision also reaffirms the TRA’s entitlement to take into account all information relevant to the assessment made by the Commissioner. The decision reaffirms case law surrounding TAA ss 108 and 108A and provides a useful summary of judicial definitions of the terms used in these sections. Issues The issues for determination were: whether the TRA erred in finding that Mr Dowden had carried on business as Safeguard during the relevant period; and whether the TRA’s determinations regarding ss 108 and 108A were in error. Decision Mr Dowden argued that the TRA did not accord enough weight to statements made by Ms Jackson during an interview with Inland Revenue staff, which, according to Mr Dowden, were admissions that she and/or a company she controlled had taken over Safeguard. He also argued that various documents, which the TRA considered showed that Mr Dowden was owner/ operator of Safeguard, evidenced no more than an inattention to detail on Mr Dowden’s part and did not show that Mr Dowden was trading as Safeguard. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 93 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES The High Court did not accept Mr Dowden’s submissions, stating that the conclusion that Mr Dowden was operating Safeguard was plainly open on the evidence and that the contemporaneous documents, including Mr Dowden’s representations, led to this conclusion. The High Court also stated that, in deciding what weight to give Ms Jackson’s statements, the TRA was entitled to take into account that she had not given evidence and was not available for cross-examination. Mr Dowden’s argument regarding ss 108 and 108A was that the Commissioner was statute-barred from amending assessments relating to Mr Dowden’s 2004 Income Tax return and various GST returns throughout 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009. Section 108(2) permits the Commissioner to amend assessments for income tax outside a 4-year statute bar where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the relevant return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or does not mention income (i.e. “omitted all mention of a gain subsequently found to be assessable income”). Section 108A(3) permits the Commissioner to amend GST assessments outside a 4-year statute bar where the Commissioner considers that the person assessed has knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose to the Commissioner all of the material facts necessary for determining the amount of GST payable. The Court held that the TRA made no error regarding the application of ss 108 and 108A, in light of its factual findings that the relevant income tax return “did not reflect \[Mr Dowden’s\] true tax position, \[...\] was misleading” and omitted income, and also that Mr Dowden, knowingly or fraudulently, failed to disclose all material facts in the relevant GST returns. The consequence of these findings was that the Commissioner was not bound by ss 108 and 108A and was entitled to increase the amounts assessed as she had done.

KeywordsGST, taxable activity, donated goods and services, unconditional gift, consideration, non-profit body, exempt supplies, time bar. Summary This proceeding was a tax challenge in relation to reassessments made for six GST periods (from the tax year ended 31 March 2012 to the tax year ended 31 March 2015) to include payments that the disputant, CD Trust, has treated as not being subject to GST. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) and upheld the reassessments (during the preparation for the hearing the Commissioner’s investigator identified that there were errors in the calculations underlying the assessments and recalculated what the correct amount of the assessments should be. The Taxation Review Authority varied the assessments accordingly pursuant to s 138P of the TAA.) Impact This decision was an orthodox application of the law on GST. The decision highlights that nomenclature used by a party is not decisive. It did not matter how the disputant’s chose to characterise the payments they were receiving for X sport court hire and coaching fees if the true nature of the payments were such that they were taxable supplies which should have been included in their GST returns. Facts The disputant was an incorporated society for the disputed period but later became a registered charity. Mr Smith was the main trustee and essentially controlled the disputant. Mr Smith leased a property (“the ABX Centre”) he owned to the disputant. The disputant subleased office space and returned the output tax on this in its returns. Mr Smith returned output on the rents he received from the disputant. In all periods the disputant’s GST inputs were greater than its outputs and therefore received a refund. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 94 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES In 2014 it appeared to the Commissioner that the disputant was utilising parts of the building it leased office space in to hire out X sport courts and charge fees for X sport coaching without returning GST output. The Commissioner amended the disputant’s GST returns to account for this income which resulted in the denial of all the GST refunds and tax owing to the Commissioner. Issues Judge Sinclair applied the law of GST to the facts of this case by analysing the following issues: 1. Whether the disputant can challenge the Commissioner’s decision under s 108A(3) of the TAA to reopen the time-bar in s 108(1)(a) of the TAA? 2. Whether the payments received by the disputant were donations and therefore not subject to GST? 3. In the alternative, whether the payments were for exempt supplies under s 14(1)(b) of the GST Act 1985? 4. If the disputant is found to have made taxable supplies, whether it is liable for shortfall penalties under s 141A of the TAA? Decision The Authority dismissed the time bar issue on the basis that pursuant to s 138E(1)(i)(v) of the TAA the decision to lift the time bar for a GST return reassessment under s 108A of the TAA is not a disputable decision that can be challenged to the Authority. The Authority held that payments received by the disputant for X sport court hire and coaching fees were not donated because these payments were not “unconditional gifts”. The disputant was not a non-profit body because the disputant’s trust deed did not prohibit it from making any distribution to its members. The use of the courts and receipt of coaching services were conditional on fees to be paid. The Authority held that payments received by the disputant for X sport court hire and coaching fees were not exempt supplies which required a supply of donated goods and services to be made by a non-profit body. The disputant was not a non-profit body. The supply of X sport court hire and provision of X sport coaching services were not donated. A lease agreement showed that the disputant was renting the X sport courts from Mr Smith. The Authority concluded that the disputant was only in the position to pay their rent to Mr Smith by hiring out the X sport courts. The disputant’s bank statements reflected reasonably regular payments being made directly to Mr Smith who conducted some X sport coaching at the ABX Centre. The disputant was not able to discharge their onus of establishing that Mr Smith (and any other X sport coaches) had donated their services to the disputant. The Authority held that the disputant did not take reasonable care in taking a tax position when it filed its GST returns. The disputant did not establish it relied on professional advice when filing their returns. The Authority accepted that Mr Smith (who prepared and managed the affairs of the disputant) was an experienced businessman who was personally GST registered meaning he had an understanding of the GST legislation. The Authority held that a reasonable person in his position would have known that the supply of X sport court hire and coaching services were taxable supplies and required GST output tax to be included in the disputant’s GST returns. Court of Appeal dismisses appeal of application for judicial review of child support assessment Case P(CA85/2019) v CIR & Ors \[2019\] NZCA 531 Decision date4 November 2019 (re-issued 3 Dec 2019) Act(s)Child Support Act 1991 KeywordsOngoing daily care; change in circumstances Summary The Court of Appeal dismissed P’s appeal and accepted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“CIR”) had acted correctly in changing P’s child support entitlement to nil. Impact The judgment confirms the result reached in the High Court. The judgment also offers some guidance regarding the relationship between amending an ongoing assessment at s 82(2) and cessing assessments under s 25. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 95 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES Facts P was the Receiving Carer in respect of A. The liable parent (“W”) resides in Australia. The original assessment was made on the basis P was providing 100% of the “ongoing daily care” of A. P and W agreed that A would go to Australia to stay with W. A was residing with W from December 2017 to July 2018. The Court found the evidence allowed the CIR to conclude the visit was intended to be for at least six months (par \[13\] of judgment). The CIR decided there had been a change in circumstances and that the ongoing daily care during this period had changed: that W provided 100% of the ongoing daily care and P had provided none. P argued there had been no change to the ongoing daily care of A and that she was entitled to receive child support payments during the relevant period. P argued that because the period of time A was staying with W fell over two child support years, there was no change of circumstances in each of the two child support years affected. The High Court had dismissed P’s judicial review (\[2019\] NZHC 98). Issues Was the CIR correct to form the opinion there had been a change in circumstances in the ongoing daily care of A in the period December 2017 to July 2018? Decision The Court accepted the general scheme of the Child Support Act 1991 (“CSA”) was that the money should follow the child so that the person providing the ongoing daily care received the financial support to do so: par \[4\] At par \[6\] the Court observed: Where there has been a request for a formula assessment, the Commissioner is required to establish the proportion of ongoing daily care that each parent and/or non-parent carer provides. The phrase “ongoing daily care” is not defined but it is evident that this is an assessment to be made by the Commissioner on the basis of all the relevant information and with the assistance of other provisions of the Act. For example, in establishing the proportions of ongoing daily care being provided by each carer, the Commissioner is required to rely on any care order or agreement in place. However a parent or carer may challenge the establishing of proportions of care on that basis if there are reasons that a care order or agreement should not be relied on. In addition, if the Commissioner is satisfied that a care order or agreement does not accurately reflect the proportion of ongoing daily care provided, she must establish the proportion of care primarily on the basis of the number of nights that the child spends with the carer. And if the number of nights spent with a carer is not regarded as a true reflection of the proportion of care actually provided then the Commissioner must establish that proportion on the basis of the amount of time the carer is responsible for the daily care of the child. On the facts of this case the Court of Appeal noted: \[27\] However, during Ms P’s submissions she conceded that, faced with the fact that A would be in Mr W’s care for a continuous six-month period, the Commissioner was entitled to conclude that a change in circumstances had occurred and to have assessed the 2018 child support year on that basis. This was a responsible concession. Although “ongoing daily care” is not defined, the ordinary meaning of that phrase conveys continuity of present circumstances into the future. Who has the ongoing daily care of a child is not a retrospective enquiry; rather, it is directed towards the current and prospective situations. Only once that assessment is made does the past becomes relevant in order to determine (by reference to the past arrangements) whether there has been a change in circumstances. \[Emphasis added\] The Court continued at\[28\]: ... The parties \[here P and W\] were required by s 82(1)(a) to notify the Commissioner of the change in circumstances because it was a change that might have affected the determination of the cost care percentage. Such notification is required specifically “\[f\]or the purpose of enabling the Commissioner to make or amend a calculation of child support payable in respect of a child”. The scheme of the Act is clear that the Commissioner must respond to changes in circumstances when they occur and on a prospective basis i.e. assessing entitlements on the basis of ongoing care arrangements. If the response was determined by past arrangements the integrity and purpose of the scheme would be undermined. \[Emphasis added\] On these facts the CIR was right to conclude the living circumstances had changed. The combined effect of ss 25(3)(b), 86, and 87 meant the CIR was entitled to alter the existing assessment and did so. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 1 February 2020 Inland Revenue Department 96 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES In an obiter dicta footnote the Court specifically excluded the circumstances of this case from the ambit of 82(2) stating: \[Footnote 36\] ...Section 82(2) goes on to specify the dates on which a change of circumstances is to be treated as having occurred where the change either increases the liability of the liable parent or decreases the liability of the receiving carer or where notice of the change was received within 28 days of the change being notified to the Commissioner. The present case does not fall within those provisions because the result in this case was that the respective liability and entitlement ceased rather than increased or decreased. Cessation of liability is specifically governed by ss 25 and 62. So although s 82 applies generally insofar as it imposes the requirement to notify of changes in circumstances, the effect of the change where liability or entitlement ceases is not affected by s 82(2). \[Emphasis added\] Given the lack of a definition of the phrase “ongoing daily care” and the fact there were no earlier decisions on the phrases, the Court did not award costs to the CIR.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department IN SUMMARY IN SUMMARY Commissioner’s statement CS 20/05: GST treatment of payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package This Commissioner’s statement discusses payments received by GST registered bodies corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package (FAP) scheme. 2 Legal decisions - case summaries – Recent Case Summaries The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Tower City Holdings Limited \[2020\] NZHC 2239 The Commissioner applied for an order under s 241(4) of the Companies Act (“CA1993”) placing the defendant company (“Tower”) into liquidation on a number of grounds, including the company’s inability to pay its debts, its failure to keep proper accounting records and breaches of various directors’ duties. The defendant company unsuccessfully argued that the order should not be made. 4 Court of Appeal finds tax avoidance, but no shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“Commissioner”) sought to disallow interest deductions claimed by Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited (“Frucor”) in respect of a tax-driven structured finance transaction it entered in to in March 2003 with the Deutsche Bank. The Commissioner contended that the funding arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of s BG 1 of the (now repealed) Income Tax Act 2004 and denied a portion of Frucor’s claims for deductions in the 2006 and 2007 income tax years. She also contended that Frucor took an unacceptable tax position and shortfall penalties should be imposed. Frucor had been successful in the High Court, with that Court holding that the funding arrangement was not a tax avoidance arrangement; the Commissioner’s assessments for 2006 and 2007 were incorrect and were thereby cancelled; and Frucor did not take an unacceptable tax position (and so the Court would have set aside the shortfall penalties imposed of $1,786,555 and $1,924,779 even if it had been wrong on its principal conclusion). The Commissioner appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the High Court, reinstated the Commissioner’s assessments with regards to the disallowed deductions and held that shortfall penalties did not apply. 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 1 COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular matter. A Commissioner’s Statement is not a consultative document. COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT CS 20/05: GST treatment of payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Summary This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s position in relation to payments received by a GST registered body corporate from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) under the Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package (FAP) scheme. The Commissioner considers that a payment under the FAP scheme from MBIE to a body corporate is not a payment in respect of any actual supply of goods and services made by the body corporate in return for that payment. However, the Commissioner considers that these payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy from the Crown under section 5(6D) of the Act, and therefore are deemed to be in response to a supply from the body corporate. As a result these payments are subject to GST. A GST registered body corporate which receives such payments is therefore obliged to include the GST component in its GST return and to pay for any net GST output tax. A body corporate which is not registered (and not liable to be registered) for GST will not be obliged to account for GST. Background Under the FAP scheme, MBIE makes payments to eligible claimants as a contribution towards the repair of their leaky property. MBIE is not responsible for repairing leaky buildings. Any repairs required, as with all building maintenance, are the responsibility of the body corporate. As a result, when MBIE makes payment to a body corporate under the FAP scheme MBIE is not paying the body corporate for any services completed on MBIE’s behalf or for any supplies made to MBIE. Instead, the FAP payments are made by MBIE to ensure properties are repaired and to provide resolution for eligible claimants faster than what was being achieved through mediation or litigation under previously available processes. Eligible claimants have not supplied anything to MBIE in return for the payments, instead the payments are connected to the property having suffered damage as a result of water ingress (for which MBIE is not liable). For GST purposes, these payments will be subject to GST because they are consideration for a “supply” as defined under section 5. A body corporate does not supply anything to MBIE in exchange for the payments under the FAP scheme. Nevertheless, as this Statement sets out, a payment from MBIE to a body corporate is still subject to GST if that payment is deemed to be consideration for a supply under section 5(6D) of the Act. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT Explanation Section 5(6D) of the Act provides: For the purposes of this Act, where any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy is made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority to— (a) any person (not being a public authority) in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity; or (b) any person for the benefit and on behalf of another person in relation to or in respect of that other person’s taxable activity,— that payment shall be deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods and services by the person to whom or for whose benefit the payment is made in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity. The key requirements of section 5(6D) are that the payment is: • • in the nature of a grant or subsidy; • • made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority; and • • made to a person in relation to or in respect of that person’s taxable activity. The Commissioner considers that FAP payments from MBIE to a GST registered body corporate meets each of these requirements. First, the payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy – MBIE makes payments under the FAP scheme as it is in the public interest to ensure that affected properties are repaired to a satisfactory standard to remain habitable by current and future homeowners. The payments are not made under any obligation by MBIE to compensate homeowners, as MBIE is not under any legal obligation to do so. As a result of being made in the public interest and not in response to any obligation, the Commissioner considers that the payments are in the nature of a grant or subsidy. Second, the FAP payments are made by the Crown– MBIE makes FAP payments on behalf of the Crown. Finally, the FAP payments are made in relation to or in respect of the GST registered claimant’s taxable activity. A key part of a GST registered body corporate’s taxable activity is the maintenance of the unit title development. In the context of leaky buildings this will include repair and remediation of the affected building. Therefore, a FAP payment from MBIE to a body corporate is made in relation to that body corporate’s taxable activity. Application This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s position on all payments from MBIE under the FAP scheme to a GST registered body corporate, including payments made before the release of this Statement. The Commissioner will continue to apply this position to all cases. If you have any concerns about your compliance with the tax obligations outlined in this Statement, you should discuss this matter with a tax professional or contact Inland Revenue to make a voluntary disclosure.

CIR v Tower City Holdings Ltd CaseThe Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Tower City Holdings Limited \[2020\] NZHC 2239 Decision date31 August 2020 CSUM 20/10 Legislative ReferencesCompanies Act 1993, ss 241(2), 241(4), 194, 131, 135, 137, 246 Tax Administration Act 1994, parts 4A and 8A High Court Rules 2014, r 5.61 Legal termsliquidation, winding-up, interim liquidation, GST, income tax Summary The Commissioner applied for an order under s 241(4) of the Companies Act (“CA1993”) placing the defendant company (“Tower”) into liquidation on a number of grounds, including the company’s inability to pay its debts, its failure to keep proper accounting records and breaches of various directors’ duties. The defendant company unsuccessfully argued that the order should not be made. Impact The result indicates that the Court will at least sometimes be willing to grant a liquidation order where some of the debt is subject to dispute, so long as the Commissioner can establish she has standing as a creditor and can make out one or more of the grounds for liquidation in s 241(4) of the CA 1993. What is still unclear is whether the Commissioner would have been (or will be in future cases) successful in establishing standing to bring the claim when all of the debt in question is the subject of dispute. Facts Background – Tower’s tax debt The Commissioner commenced an audit of Tower (a property development company) in 2015, and in May 2017 made default assessments in respect of income tax for the tax years ended 31 March 2014 to 31 March 2016. Only the assessment for the 2016 year resulted in a liability to pay tax. The assessed income tax of $4,084,478.22 related to the sale of three properties in Auckland. The Commissioner also assessed Tower for an evasion shortfall penalty of $3,063,358.70. A default assessment was also made in May 2017 in respect of GST for the period ended 31 July 2016, resulting in GST to pay of $273,913.04, relating to the sale of another Auckland property. An evasion shortfall penalty of $205,434.78 was assessed for failing to declare the sale for GST purposes. The total amount of the assessments came to $7,627,184.74. Tower issued NOPAs in respect of the assessments, and the Commissioner issued NORs. The dispute reached conference stage and then stalled during the process of organising a date for a facilitated conference. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES In March 2019, Tower filed two income tax returns for the tax years ending 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2018. The 2017 return declared $46,331 to pay, which was due to be paid by 7 February 2018 but was not paid. Tower also filed GST returns in March 2019, covering five GST periods. One return, for the period ended 31 December 2017, assessed GST to pay of $286,885.27, which was due to be paid by 28 February 2019, but was not paid. After the audit began, Tower transferred a number of properties out of its ownership, without applying any of the proceeds to its tax debts. The Commissioner was particularly concerned about the nature of some of the property transactions, which did not appear to be arms-length commercial transactions between bona fide third parties, and with the dissipation of the proceeds to Tower’s director and to two other individuals involved with the management and control of the company (both had at times also been directors). For this reason, the Commissioner made the application for the appointment of interim liquidators as well as the liquidation application. Liquidation application and the application for the appointment of interim liquidators The Commissioner filed an application to place Tower into liquidation in July 2019. At the same time, she filed a without application for an order under s 246 of the CA 1993 appointing interim liquidators to Tower, which was granted. (Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Tower City Holdings Ltd \[2019\] NZHC1577) In granting the application for the appointment of interim liquidators, Associate Judge Andrews concluded that the Commissioner’s application would in all probability succeed. The Court agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that the dispute raised by Tower was not genuine, but rather a delaying tactic. There was also a portion of the tax that was self-assessed and not subject to any dispute. Further, there was no prejudice to Tower’s ability to pursue its dispute, as the Commissioner’s application expressly sought to preserve Tower’s dispute and/or challenge rights under Parts 4A and 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TA A”). The grounds under s 241(4) of the CA 1993 upon which the Commissioner based her liquidation claim were: Tower was unable to pay its debts, not only because it was insolvent, but because the wilful actions and conduct of those with control and management of Tower were preventing it from paying its debts (s 241(4)(a)); Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Tower City Holdings Limited \[2020\] NZHC 2239. Tower had persistently or seriously failed to keep proper accounting records (s 241(4)(b)); Tower’s directors had in a serious or persistent way failed to comply with duties relating to Tower under the CA 1993, specifically their duties under s 131, 135 and 137 (s 241(4)(bb)); and It was just and equitable that Tower be placed into liquidation by the Court. Issues Preliminary question – Did the Commissioner have standing to claim as a “creditor” of Tower? Was the liquidation proceeding vexatious, and/or an abuse of process? Had the Commissioner shown that Tower had persistently or seriously failed to comply with s 194 of the CA 1993 ? Had the Commissioner shown that Tower was unable to pay its debts? Did Tower have a genuine and substantial argument that there were GST set-offs which did or may exceed any amount owing to the Commissioner? Had the Commissioner shown that Tower’s directors had, in a persistent and/or serious way, failed to comply with duties relating to Tower under ss 131, 135, and/or 137 of the CA 1993? Had the Commissioner shown that it would be just and equitable to put Tower into liquidation? Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Decision Did the Commissioner have standing to claim as a “creditor” of Tower? The Court held that the Commissioner was a creditor of Tower, based on Tower’s two self-assessed returns showing an indebtedness of $333,216.27, and did not require leave (as a prospective or contingent creditor would have done) to bring the claim. Was the liquidation proceeding vexatious, and/or an abuse of process? This became an issue because counsel for Tower submitted that the claim had been brought for vexatious or ulterior motives, namely: • • so that the Commissioner could avoid determining Tower’s GST returns and/or making refunds to Tower; • • to obtain information about third parties, • • to deny Tower its rights to dispute and/or challenge the Commissioner’s application under the TAA. The Court found that there was no basis for any of the allegations of abuse of process. Had the Commissioner shown that Tower had persistently or seriously failed to comply with s 194 of the CA 1993? The Court found that there was “no doubt” that the Commissioner had shown that Tower had seriously and persistently failed to comply with its obligations under s 194 of the CA 1993 (being the obligation to keep proper accounting records). The Court concluded that satisfying this ground was sufficient for the Commissioner to be entitled to a liquidation order, and that there was no sound basis on which it should exercise its discretion against making an order. The liquidation order was therefore made on the basis of this ground having been established. Had the Commissioner shown that Tower was unable to pay its debts? Having determined that a liquidation order would be granted on the previous issue, the Court considered that there was strictly no need to address this issue, but recorded that, if necessary, it would have found for the Commissioner on this issue. Did Tower have a genuine and substantial argument that there were GST set-offs which did or may exceed any amount owing to the Commissioner? Again, an answer was not strictly required, but had an answer been necessary, the Court’s answer would have been “no”. It was not disputed that Tower owed the self-assessed amounts of tax, and r 5.61 of the High Court Rules 2016 precludes any set-off against that debt. Had the Commissioner shown that Tower’s directors had, in a persistent and/or serious way, failed to comply with duties relating to Tower under ss 131, 135, and/or 137 of the CA 1993? Again, no answer was required, and with respect to this issue the Court considered it “neither necessary nor appropriate to embark on an analysis of the performance of the directors, in a number of complex transactions, in order to make findings on whether they discharged their respective duties under ss 131, 135, and 137 of the Act (and to the extent that they did not, whether their defaults can be characterised as “persistent” or “serious”, so as to justify the making of a liquidation order).” Had the Commissioner shown that it would be just and equitable to put Tower into liquidation? Again, the Court considered there was no need to address this issue, as the need for a liquidation was clear on the issue of serious and persistent breach of s 194 of the Act, and “nothing useful would be added by making findings on the question of whether the circumstances are also caught by the broad “just and equitable” jurisdiction in s 241(4)(d) of the Act.” About this document These are brief case summaries, prepared by Inland Revenue, of decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the District Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in matters involving the Revenue Acts. For Taxation Review Authority matters, names have been anonymized. The findings of the court described in a case summary will no longer represent current law where the matter has been successfully appealed or subsequent amended legislation has been enacted. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Court of Appeal finds tax avoidance, but no shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position CaseCommissioner of Inland Revenue v Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited \[2020\] NZCA 383. Decision date 3 September 2020 CSUM 20/11 Legislative ReferencesIncome Tax Act 2004, ss BG 1, DB 7, EH 48(3)(a), subpart EW, GB 1, OB 1, OB 6. Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 108, 141B, 141D, 141FB. Legal termsTax avoidance, tax advantage, shortfall penalties, unacceptable tax position. Summary The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“Commissioner”) sought to disallow interest deductions claimed by Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited (“Frucor”) in respect of a tax-driven structured finance transaction it entered in to in March 2003 with the Deutsche Bank. The Commissioner contended that the funding arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of s BG 1 of the (now repealed) Income Tax Act 2004 and denied a portion of Frucor’s claims for deductions in the 2006 and 2007 income tax years. She also contended that Frucor took an unacceptable tax position and shortfall penalties should be imposed. Frucor had been successful in the High Court, with that Court holding that the funding arrangement was not a tax avoidance arrangement; the Commissioner’s assessments for 2006 and 2007 were incorrect and were thereby cancelled; and Frucor did not take an unacceptable tax position (and so the Court would have set aside the shortfall penalties imposed of $1,786,555 and $1,924,779 even if it had been wrong on its principal conclusion). The Commissioner appealed and the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the High Court, reinstated the Commissioner’s assessments with regards to the disallowed deductions and held that shortfall penalties did not apply. Impact The decision confirmed that the prohibition on identification of an economically equivalent arrangement that would not have constituted tax avoidance does not preclude consideration of the economic and commercial effect of the transaction under scrutiny. Such consideration, focusing entirely on the funding arrangement in question, was central to the second stage of the Ben Nevis analysis. The artificial and contrived features of the funding arrangement revealed the purpose of the arrangement was to dress up a subscription for equity as an interest only loan to achieve a tax advantage. The decision also confirmed that where an arrangement is deemed void in accordance with s BG1 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the taxpayer’s deductions and assessable income may be adjusted by the Commissioner by application of s GB 1, as she thinks appropriate to counteract any tax advantage obtained by the taxpayer from or under the arrangement. The tax advantage with which the section is concerned is the New Zealand tax advantage achieved by the New Zealand taxpayer and the Commissioner is not required to consider other arrangements the taxpayer might have entered into had it not chosen to proceed with the tax avoidance arrangement under review. Thus, the Commissioner may reconstruct by allowing a portion of a deduction and disallowing the balance. The Court of Appeal accepted the High Court’s expression of the test for whether a taxpayer takes “an unacceptable tax position” under s 141B, as “whether there is substantial merit in the taxpayer’s arguments.” Although it came to different conclusion on the core tax avoidance issue, it was not persuaded that Frucor’s arguments could be dismissed as lacking substantial merit, and this was particularly so where a lower court Judge explained in a careful, closely reasoned and comprehensive judgment why he was persuaded those arguments were factually and legally correct. Facts Frucor entered into a funding arrangement, whereby Deutsche Bank advanced $204m to Frucor in exchange for a fee of $1.8 million and a convertible note redeemable at maturity in five years’ time by the issue of 1,025 non-voting shares in Frucor (“the note”). The $204m advance by Deutsche Bank was funded by a contemporaneous payment of $149m from Frucor’s parent Danone Asia Pty Ltd (“DAP”) for the forward purchase of the shares from Deutsche Bank in five years’ time at a pre-agreed price matching the face value of the note (the forward purchase agreement). The balance of $55m was contributed by Deutsche Bank. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Over the life of the note, Frucor paid $66m to Deutsche Bank and claimed the full $66m as interest payments on an interest only basis on $204m. The $66m coupon payments equated to the amount required to pay amortising principal and interest on the $55m introduced into the funding arrangement by Deutsche Bank. Issues The issues for consideration by the Court of Appeal were: • • Did the High Court err in finding the funding arrangement was not a tax avoidance arrangement under s BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the Act”)? • • Did the Commissioner correctly counteract the tax advantage under s GB 1 of the Act? (Frucor argued there was no tax advantage even if this was a tax avoidance arrangement. Muir J in the High Court did not need to deal with this issue because of his principal finding. Frucor gave the Court of Appeal notice it supported the High Court judgment on this additional ground.) • • Did the High Court err in finding that shortfall penalties should not be imposed in any event? Decision Tax Avoidance The Court of Appeal found that it was “reasonably plain” that the funding arrangement had New Zealand tax avoidance as one of its purposes or effects and this was not merely incidental to some other purpose. The primary purpose of the funding arrangement was to provide a tax advantage to Frucor through the interest deductions it claimed. The funding arrangement was in many respects artificial and clearly contrived. The Court of Appeal found that taking the parts of the arrangement together, the purpose of the arrangement was to “dress up a subscription for equity as an interest only loan to achieve a tax advantage.” Gilbert J concluded: “\[i\]t is hard to discern any rational commercial explanation for the artificial and contrived features of the arrangement, other than tax avoidance.” Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Frucor Suntory New Zealand Limited \[2020\] NZCA 383. As a matter of commercial and economic reality, the Court of Appeal found that the payment of $149m by DAP did not carry any interest liability for Frucor or Deutsche Bank. The only amount that did attract interest was the $55m advanced by Deutsche Bank under the note, for which Frucor paid $11m in deductible interest expenditure. Therefore, Frucor used the specific provisions to claim deductions for interest in an artificial and contrived manner that cannot have been within Parliament’s contemplation. The Court of Appeal held it was not relevant that Frucor could have borrowed the $204 million from another Danone entity at an arm’s length rate of interest and be entitled to claim the same interest deductions. The focus must be on the arrangement that was entered into, not one that might have been entered in to but was not. The Court of Appeal concluded that the prohibition on identification of an economically equivalent arrangement does not preclude consideration of the economic and commercial effect of the transaction under scrutiny. Such consideration, focusing entirely on the funding arrangement in question, is central to the second stage of the Ben Nevis analysis and it is by no means “almost meaningless” or a “mere checkpoint for the Commissioner to divert around” as the High Court Judge had suggested. The Court of Appeal held: We consider that when the economic and commercial effect of the funding arrangement is examined in its context, it becomes clear that tax avoidance was its principal purpose or effect or, at least, tax avoidance was not merely an incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement. In summary, we accept the Commissioner’s submission that by entering into the funding arrangement Frucor achieved a $66 million interest deduction without incurring a corresponding economic cost for which Parliament intended deductions would be available. As a matter of commercial and economic reality, $55 million of the claimed interest represented the repayment of principal borrowed from Deutsche Bank and was not an interest cost. We have therefore concluded that the Commissioner was entitled to invoke s BG 1. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 10 November 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Section GB 1 The Court of Appeal noted that the tax advantage with which s GB 1 is concerned is the New Zealand tax advantage achieved by the New Zealand taxpayer (here Frucor). The funding costs and tax position of other parties to the funding arrangement are irrelevant to the analysis under s GB 1. The Court of Appeal held the tax advantage gained under the arrangement was not the entire interest deductions, but only those that were principal repayment of $55m. The Commissioner was therefore, entitled to reconstruct by allowing the permissible deductions totalling $11m but disallowing the balance. She was not required to consider other arrangements the taxpayer might have entered in to, had it not chosen this particular funding arrangement. Shortfall Penalties The Commissioner sought to impose shortfall penalties under s 141B of the Tax Administration Act for Frucor’s taking of “an unacceptable tax position” that when viewed objectively, failed to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The Commissioner contended that Frucor had taken such a position because tax avoidance was the dominant purpose of the arrangement. Frucor submitted that the question of whether a taxpayer’s position was “about as likely as not to be correct” was correctly distilled by the High Court Judge to “whether there is substantial merit in \[the taxpayer’s\] arguments”. Expressed another way, Frucor submitted, the question is whether the taxpayer’s argument would be seriously considered by a court. Frucor submitted that the High Court judgment was a complete answer to any question of penalties. Relying on the decision of Kós J in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v John Curtis Developments Ltd, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v John Curtis Developments Ltd \[2014\] NZHC 3034, (2014) 26 NZTC 21-113, Frucor submitted that its position must be regarded as one capable of being reasonably adopted and having substantial merit - given it was found to be correct by the High Court. The Court of Appeal agreed with Frucor referencing the Supreme Court’s stance in Ben Nevis, Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 that the inclusion of the word “about” in the test shows that a 50 per cent prospect of success is not the standard; rather the question is whether the merits of the arguments supporting the taxpayer’s interpretation are substantial. The Court of Appeal held that although it came to a different conclusion from the High Court on the core tax avoidance issue, it was not persuaded that Frucor’s arguments could be dismissed as lacking in substantial merit. The Court of Appeal regarded the High Court judge, Muir J as an experienced commercial Judge who regarded Frucor’s argument as deserving of serious consideration. The High Court judgment explained in a careful, closely reasoned and comprehensive way, the reasons why the Judge was persuaded Frucor’s arguments were factually and legally correct. The appeal was allowed, and the orders made in the High Court were set aside.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department IN SUMMARY IN SUMMARY New legislation The Privacy (Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue, New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service, and Serious Fraud Office) Order 2020 This Order approves an information sharing agreement entitled Information Sharing Agreement Between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service and Serious Fraud Office which was entered into under the Privacy Act 1993. This agreement enables the sharing of information to assist the identification, investigation and prosecution of serious crimes. 2 Determinations COV 20/11: Variation of section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for applications to change GST taxable period This COVID-19 variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means that some taxpayers may now wish to file on a one-monthly basis to provide earlier access to any GST refunds. It allows the change of taxable period to take effect much sooner than would otherwise be the case. 6 COV 20/12: Variation in relation to the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Lessors and lessees may have agreed to extend lease terms (or intend to do so) due to the financial impacts of COVID-19. The time period in the definition of “finance lease” has been extended using s 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow certain extended leases to continue to be treated as operating leases. 8 Standard practice statement SPS 20/05: Student loan repayment – options for relief This standard practice statement updates and replaces SPS 11/03 Student Loans - Relief from repayment obligations. This replacement standard practice statement reflects the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and changes introduced by the Inland Revenue transformation programme to encourage borrowers to self-manage student loans via the myIR secure online service.. 10 Legal decisions - case summaries Vivien Judith Madsen-Reis and Henry David Levin as Liquidators of Debut Homes Limited (in Liquidation) and Debut Homes Limited (in Liquidation) v Leonard Wayne Cooper and Leonard Wayne Cooper and Tracey Cooper as Trustees of the L & T Cooper Family Trust \[2020\] NZSC 100 This Judgment sets out the scheme of the Companies Act 1993 and the underlying principles for assessing whether a director has breached their duties under ss 131 (duty to act in the best interests of the company), 135 (reckless trading), 136 (duty not to incur obligations without reasonable grounds to believe the company can meet them when they fall due) and the correct approach to determining the compensation to be ordered under s 301.

NEW LEGISLATION The Privacy (Information Sharing Agreement between Inland Revenue, New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service, and Serious Fraud Office) Order 2020 Extending the serious crime information sharing agreement The Privacy (Information Sharing Agreement Between Inland Revenue, New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service, and Serious Fraud Office) Order 2020 came into force on 1 October 2020. The order approves an information sharing agreement entitled Information Sharing Agreement Between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police, New Zealand Customs Service and Serious Fraud Office which was entered into under the Privacy Act 1993. This agreement enables the sharing of information to assist the identification, investigation and prosecution of serious crimes. Background An Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) is a legal mechanism under the Privacy Act, which authorises the sharing of personal information between or within agencies for delivering efficient and effective public services. An AISA provides certainty on the purpose of the information sharing, the use of the information, the management of privacy risks, and the information safeguards. The serious crime AISA was implemented in 2014 to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the New Zealand Police (Police), either on request or proactively, to help reduce the level of serious crime committed in New Zealand. A serious crime is one punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more. Inland Revenue provides information to the Police where it is relevant to the serious offence being investigated and meets the criteria for disclosure. The Police can request a range of information from Inland Revenue, which includes non-individual and individual information about tax returns, debt, audit history, and information about individuals who are linked to those suspected of serious criminal activity. This agreement has proved successful, facilitating the investigation of over 500 cases. More recently, the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) expressed interest in joining the AISA and receiving information from Inland Revenue to assist their identification, investigation and prosecution of serious crimes involving fraud and corruption or cross-border crime punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more. The discussion document (Targeting Serious Crime: Extending information sharing) released at the end of 2018 presented the proposals for extending the existing serious crime AISA between Inland Revenue and the Police to include the SFO and Customs. The document outlined that the original serious crime AISA’s framework, mechanisms, robust privacy safeguards and the serious crime threshold would also apply to information sharing from Inland Revenue to Customs and the SFO. The parties could share information for the purposes of the prevention, detection, or investigation of a serious crime or that is evidence in the prosecution of a serious crime. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION Key features A new AISA has been entered into by Inland Revenue and the participating agencies (being Police, Customs, and the SFO) for the sharing of information in relation to serious offences. Definition of serious crime The AISA applies to offending that relates to crimes punishable by a term of imprisonment of four years or more and replicates the threshold used in the original agreement between Inland Revenue and Police. The four-year threshold aligns with the test for the offence of participation in an organised criminal group under section 98A of the Crimes Act 1961 and is consistent with the definition of a “serious crime” in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. The Customs offences that meet this threshold are such crimes as relating to controlled drugs (the importing, exporting or possessing for supply), knowingly importing or exporting objectionable publications, money laundering, and defrauding Customs revenue. These offences carry penalties that are between five years and life imprisonment. All the offences considered by the Serious Fraud Office carry maximum terms of imprisonment of at least seven years and involve the most serious forms of financial crime. Test for sharing Information sharing under this AISA will only occur where the following strict tests are met. A participating agency can request information from Inland Revenue A participating agency may request Information from Inland Revenue where the agency: • • considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a serious crime has been, is being, or will be, committed • • considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence relevant to, a serious crime • • confirms that it reasonably believes that the amount of Information requested is reasonable and proportionate for those purposes, in the circumstances, and • • has taken all reasonable steps to obtain the Information from other sources without success (where practicable). In considering whether to share information with a participating agency, Inland Revenue reviews the request and may share information where all of the following are met. Inland Revenue: • • requests any additional information necessary from the participating agency or clarification of the request to enable the department to consider the request • • determines that it is practicable to share the Information • • is satisfied that the scope of the Information to be shared is limited to that which is necessary for the purposes of the particular request, and • • is satisfied that it is reasonable, necessary and in the public interest to provide the Information to the participating agency. Inland Revenue can proactively share information Inland Revenue may proactively share information with a participating agency where the department: • • considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a serious crime has been, is being, or will be, committed • • considers that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the Information is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence relevant to, a serious crime • • determines that it is practicable to share the Information • • is satisfied that the scope of the Information to be shared is limited to that which is necessary in the circumstances of the particular disclosure, and • • is satisfied that it is reasonable, necessary and in the public interest to provide the Information to the participating agency. Information that can be shared The AISA provides for the sharing of information between Inland Revenue and each of the other agencies either in response to a request for information from another agency or proactively, from Inland Revenue to the other agencies. The agreement does not provide for the sharing of information between the other agencies (for example, sharing cannot occur between SFO and Customs under the AISA). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 3 NEW LEGISLATION The information that Inland Revenue can disclose to the other agencies under the AISA will be information that is readily available and has been collected for tax purposes. Inland Revenue will not exercise its powers to collect information on behalf of other agencies, share information that is not readily available within Inland Revenue or share information that is not relevant to the serious crime in question. Where the tests for sharing information above have been met, an agency may request that Inland Revenue share Information falling within the categories in Row 1 of the table below and Inland Revenue may share such Information in response to a request. In making such a request of Inland Revenue, a participating agency may itself need to share information (both personal and non-personal) and the grounds for the request to enable Inland Revenue to process the request and/or for Inland Revenue to assess whether relevant parts of the test are met. Inland Revenue may proactively share Information described in Row 2 of the table below where it considers that a serious crime has been, is being, or will be committed and the tests above have been met. This means that Inland Revenue may proactively share Information with a participating agency that could otherwise be requested by the agency under Row 1. Inland Revenue may also share any other Information discovered by IR whilst carrying out its usual functions and duties, when the test for sharing is met. Inland Revenue may share the following information with a participating agency: Row 1Information Inland Revenue may share with a participating agency upon request • Information about a person’s associates • Tax Information • Financial Transaction Information • Financial relationship information (for example, a fellow director of a company or a fellow partner of a partnership) • D omestic relationship information (for example, whether the suspect has a partner, husband, wife, children) • In formation about assets • Employment information • Person records • S ocial assistance information Row 2Information Inland Revenue may share with a participating agency proactively • I nformation falling within the categories in Row 1 above • A ny other Information discovered by Inland Revenue while carrying out its usual functions and duties (however discovered). For example, information obtained during an audit about where drugs are located. Sharing information obtained by compulsion The AISA imposes conditions on Inland Revenue sharing information with the other agencies that was obtained by compulsion for tax purposes using section 17B of the TAA. Prior to sharing such information, Inland Revenue needs to review the information to determine whether limitations should be placed on its use and/or its security. Also, where Inland Revenue obtains information by compulsion by way of an inquiry held by the Commissioner or a District Court Judge (under sections 17I or 17J of the Tax Administration Act 1994), information may only be shared with: • • Police or Customs in relation to charges of perjury against a person, or • • SFO upon request (not proactively) where SFO confirms that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence involving serious or complex fraud may have been committed and confirms that the test for sharing information upon request under this AISA is met. Information obtained by Inland Revenue by compulsion can be shared with the SFO as it has similar powers to compel the production of information as Inland Revenue. An agency may proactively share information that it holds in relation to serious crime with IR where other legislation provides for such sharing. For example, section 36 of the Serious Fraud Office Act 1990 or under one of the exceptions to the privacy principles contained in section 22 of the Privacy Act 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 NEW LEGISLATION Sharing information about third parties The AISA enables a participating agency to request information about third parties, being a person that is connected to a suspect in a serious crime. A third party can include a person in a relationship with a suspect or a family member or an associate of a suspect. Before information about a third party is provided to an agency, the agency has to both justify that the above tests are met with regard to the suspect and justify that the above tests are met with regard to linking the third-party to the suspect. The agency also has to prove that the third-party information is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation of, or is evidence relevant to, a serious crime and confirm that it reasonably believes that the amount of Information requested is reasonable and proportionate for those purposes, in the circumstances. Prior to Inland Revenue sharing third party information with Police, Customs, or SFO, it will ensure that it meets the above tests, it is practicable for IR to share the Information, that the information is limited to that which is necessary for the purposes of the particular request, and that it is in the public interest to provide the Information to the participating agency. Participating agencies will use reasonable endeavours to protect the interests of persons who are indirectly connected to a serious crime or related to a person who is a suspect in a serious crime. Such measures could include redacting third-party information from information given in evidence or requiring third-party information to be destroyed once it is no longer required. How participating agencies may use the information A participating agency may use information received under the AISA for purposes of prevention, detection, or investigation of, or to use as evidence of, a serious crime. For example, the types of activities could include, but are not limited to: • • the potential commissioning of a serious crime • • identifying individuals involved in a serious crime (including victims, witnesses, offenders) • • identifying lines of inquiry for a serious crime • • using information as intelligence for a serious crime investigation • • using the information as evidence in the investigation and prosecution of any person for a serious crime • • using information as part of an investigation into serious crime to identify roles and relationships within criminal networks to then identify the enablers of financial structures • • identifying potential victims or offenders of serious crime to enable activation of preventative measures, or • • enabling, where the test is met, the sharing of information for joint participating agency and IR taskforces. An agency cannot use any information obtained under the AISA for any other purpose that is not enabled under the AISA.

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS COV 20/11: Variation of section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for applications to change GST taxable period Determination The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: Section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is varied to state that a change in taxable period takes effect at the commencement of the \[6-month\] taxable period in which the person applies to change the basis on which the person’s taxable period is set. This variation applies to a registered person who wishes to change from a 6-month to a 1-month taxable period, and for a 6-month taxable period commencing between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021. The variation is subject to the following conditions: • • The person notifies the CIR before 31 March 2021 that they wish their election to have this effect; and • • The person does not elect to change back from a 1-month taxable period before 30 September 2021. • • The impacts of COVID-19, including uncertainty as to its financial impacts, materially affected the person’s ability to make this election earlier and they expect applying this variation will materially assist the sustainability of their business. Application date This variation applies from 4 November 2020 to 31 March 2021 Dated at Wellington on 4 November 2020 Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel Inland Revenue Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. Section 15(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows a person to apply to the Commissioner to have a one-month taxable period for GST. Under s 15D(2) of the GST Act, the change in taxable period takes effect at the end of the taxable period in which the person applies. The effective date of the change has been modified to the start of the taxable period using s 6I of the TAA. Provisions affected 2. Section 15D(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Application of variation: 3. This variation applies to a person who wishes to change from a six-month taxable period to a one-month taxable period for GST. A person is permitted to do so under s 15(3) of the GST Act, but the change will take effect from the end of the taxable period in which they apply. This variation allows that change to be effective from the start of the taxable period in which a person applies. The variation recognises that the impact of COVID-19 means that some taxpayers may now wish to file on a one-monthly basis to provide earlier access to any GST refunds. It allows the change of taxable period to take effect much sooner than would otherwise be the case. 4. The variation is aimed primarily at a person who applies to change their taxable period after 1 October 2020 to allow that change to take effect sooner. A person who has a standard balance date and applied after the expiry of variation COV 20/03 on 30 June 2020, but before 1 October, will already be on a one-monthly taxable period effective 1 October 2020 without the need for a variation. The variation may apply to a person with a non-standard balance date who applies in a taxable period that commenced before 1 October 2020 and is still in progress. Associated variations: COV 20/03 5.

Legislative References Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 6H and 6I Goods and Services Tax Act 1 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS COV 20/12: Variation in relation to the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Determination The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has, under the discretion provided under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made the following statutory variation: T he time period of “more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life” referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is extended to “more than 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life plus an additional 18 months” where the term of the lease is extended between 14 February 2020 and 31 March 2021. The variation is subject to the following conditions: • • The lease was entered into before 14 February 2020. • • The lease term was not more than 75% of the estimated useful life when the lease was entered into. • • The lease term is not extended more than 18 months beyond the end of its term as at 14 February 2020. • • The lease was extended because, in the period between January 2020 and 31 March 2021, the lessee’s business has experienced a significant decline in actual or predicted revenue which means the lessee had difficulty satisfying their existing lease agreement, and that decline in actual or predicted revenue is related to COVID-19. Application date This variation applies from 5 November 2020 to 31 March 2021 Dated at Wellington on 5 November 2020 Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel Inland Revenue Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Background (material under this heading does not form part of the variation) Summary of effect 1. An operating lease of an asset has a maximum term of 75% of the asset’s estimated useful life before it is treated for tax purposes as a finance lease (with different tax treatment) under the Income Tax Act 2007. Lessors and lessees may have agreed to extend lease terms (or intend to do so) due to the financial impacts of COVID-19. The time period in the definition of “finance lease” has been extended using s 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow certain extended leases to continue to be treated as operating leases. Provisions affected 2. Paragraph (b) of the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application of variation: 3. This variation applies to a person who has entered into an operating lease of an asset, but the lease term has been extended beyond 75% of the estimated useful life of the asset, and so in the absence of this variation it would be reclassified as a finance lease for tax purposes, with associated complexity and compliance costs. 4. T he variation is subject to the conditions that the lease was entered into before 14 February 2020; that the lease term was not more than 75% of the estimated useful life when the lease was entered into; and that the lessee has experienced a significant decline in actual or predicted revenue related to COVID-19 meaning the lessee had difficulty in satisfying their existing lease agreement. 5. Customers who may wish to apply this variation should note: • • A lessor and lessee are not required to adopt the same treatment of the lease asset as both parties can make their own decision about whether they rely on the variation; • • Customers do not need to take the same approach to all leases they have entered into for the same class of lease asset; • • The variation applies to leases that are extended between 14 February 2020 and 31 March 2021 and is not limited to leases where the lease term would otherwise have ended during that period. Associated variations: COV 20/03 6. This variation has the same effect as the earlier COV 20/08 “Variation in relation to the definition of “finance lease” in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007” which expires on 30 November 2020. It provides additional time for a person to decide whether to extend their operating leases without them becoming finance leases for tax purposes. Legislative References Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 6H and 6I Income Tax Act 2007: s YA 1, paragraph (b) of the definition of finance lease About this document These variations concern the Commissioner’s additional discretion to extend a due date, deadline, time period or timeframe or vary a procedural or administrative requirement arising from COVID-19 or the Government’s response measures. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 9 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS SPS 20/05: Student loan repayment – options for relief Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This standard practice statement updates and replaces SPS 11/03 Student Loans - Relief from repayment obligations. This replacement standard practice statement reflects the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and changes introduced by the Inland Revenue transformation programme to encourage borrowers to self-manage student loans via the myIR secure online service. S TA RT DAT E 10 Nov 2020 REPLACES: SPS 11/03 Introduction This Statement sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for providing relief 1 under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (the “Act”). It covers relief from payments for: • • overdue student loan repayment obligations • • student loan repayment obligations not yet due • • student loan repayment obligations for the current tax year, and • • penalty 2 and late payment interest imposed on overdue student loan repayment obligations. All legislative references in this Statement refer to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, unless otherwise specified. Application This Statement applies from the date of signing. It replaces SPS 11/03: Student Loans – relief from repayment obligations, which was published in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 23, No 2 (March 2011). Standard practice Summary 1. Requests for relief are generally not required by any specific time. However, a request for anticipated hardship for a future year’s obligations should be received by Inland Revenue on or before 31 March in the current tax year. 2. R equests will be considered based on a borrower’s current or future ability to meet their student loan repayment obligation. In considering a request, the Commissioner will look at all options available to a borrower to enable them to meet their loan repayment obligations. 3. When providing relief, the Commissioner may: • • refrain from issuing a notice of assessment, and may write off a student loan repayment obligation not more than $20; • • refrain from the collection of any student loan repayment obligation payable that is more than $20 but less than $334 (excluding late payment interest); 1 The reference to “relief ” for the purposes of this statement is to the overall relief provisions contained in Subpart 4 of the Act and includes “hardship relief ” in section 147 of the Act. The reference to “serious hardship’ is as provided under section 147(1)(a) of the Act, where hardship relief may be granted based on serious hardship. 2 The reference to “penalty” in this statement refers to penalties defined in section 146A of the Act and does not include abusive tax position penalties or evasion or similar act penalties as per sections 141D and 141 E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS • • reduce any amount that must be paid by a borrower for the current tax year, or the next tax year; • • reduce a repayment obligation for a previous tax year (the amount not collected is capitalised and will remain on their loan); • • agree to an instalment arrangement to repay an unpaid amount; • • refund any amount paid for the previous or current tax year; • • cancel some or all the late payment interest if it would be equitable to do so. Detailed discussion Request for relief 4. Borrowers are encouraged to contact Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity if they think that they may have trouble meeting their repayment obligations on time, so that the options for payment and loan relief can be discussed 3 . 5. R equests can be made through the self-service options available in Inland Revenue’s myIR Secure Online Services, by telephone or other manner acceptable to the Commissioner. 6. To ensure there is a record of a request made by a borrower, the ability to accept requests by telephone is limited to calls that are received by Inland Revenue at a site that has call recording. That can be achieved by calling one of Inland Revenue’s 0800 numbers. Where a call is received by a site that does not have call recording, the borrower may be asked to put their request through use of the myIR Secure Online Services or by letter. 7. A b orrower requesting relief should clearly advise why they cannot make loan repayments as required or why they think relief should be given for some other special reason. Each application will be considered on its own merits. The Commissioner may ask the borrower to provide further information in support of their request. Relief options Relief from small amounts 8. For small amounts owed, the Commissioner: • • will not issue an assessment nor collect 4 a student loan repayment obligation, if the amount payable is $20 or less. However, this discretion will not generally apply to situations where borrowers have not provided their employer a “SL” Tax Code Declaration and a pay period student loan obligation repayment shortfall occurs as a consequence. Alternatively, when a borrower’s consolidated loan balance is $20 or less at the end of the year, a write-off will occur at that date; or • • if the amount is more than $20 but less than $334 (excluding late payment interest), the Commissioner may choose to not collect the small amount if the due date for payment has passed. However, the amount not collected will remain on the loan balance and where applicable will accrue interest. Reduce a repayment obligation 9. A student loan borrower’s repayment obligation may be reduced if the Commissioner is satisfied that serious hardship will be caused as a consequence of a repayment obligation or there are other special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to do so. Salary and wage earners 10. If a borrower is a salary and wage earner, their repayment obligation is determined on a pay period basis. If the Commissioner grants hardship relief by reducing the borrower’s repayment obligation, she will issue the borrower with a special repayment deduction rate certificate that varies the rate of payment for a current or future year to reflect the reduced repayment obligation. 11. R elief is also available via a repayment exemption for full-time students who also work and earn under the annual repayment threshold. An exemption applies only to borrowers’ who receive salary or wages or pre-taxed income, and any untaxed income is less than $500. Eligible borrowers may request an exemption on a quarterly basis, so that their earnings do not have student loan repayment deductions made by an employer, when their pay period earnings would otherwise prompt loan repayments. 3 I f a student loan borrower also has a tax debt or a child support debt, they should refer to SPS 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt or SPS 19/05 Options for relief from Child Support debt. 4 and write off an amount payable (less than $20) by an employer or PAYE intermediary. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 12. Similarly, borrowers with more than one employer and whose main income is below the student loan repayment threshold can apply for a reduced deduction rate on their secondary employment earnings for any remaining unused repayment threshold. These payment reductions also only apply on a quarterly basis and a new request is required if borrowers want a reduced payment rate extended for any quarterly unused repayment threshold amount that is available for offset against pre-taxed income. 13. The borrower may request Inland Revenue send a certificate directly to their employer, or they will need to give the certificate received to their employer, who can then apply a reduced rate for, or exemption from, a student loan repayment. 14. T he amount not collected because of a repayment rate reduction will remain on the loan balance. Income from other sources 15. If a borrower receives income from other sources (other than or in addition to their salary and wages) of $500 or more, their repayment obligation is the amount of their student loan repayable determined on their adjusted net income for a tax year. 16. I f the Commissioner grants repayment relief, the percentage payable by the borrower (for receiving income that is not subject to PAYE) will be reduced. 17. The amount not collected because of a reduction of a repayment obligation will remain on the loan balance. Temporary repayment suspension 18. A borrower who intends to be overseas-based for 365 consecutive days or less, may request a temporary repayment suspension 5 (formally called a repayment holiday) from their repayment obligations. A criterion is that a borrower must be New Zealand based and is required to nominate a contact person who resides in New Zealand, for the period of their absence from New Zealand. Borrowers can apply for a temporary repayment suspension in myIR or by calling us. Commissioner may treat certain borrowers as being physically in New Zealand 19. Borrowers can apply to keep a student loan interest free overseas, when they are: • • unexpectedly delayed when returning to New Zealand • • unexpectedly required to travel after having returned to New Zealand • • studying overseas • • working overseas for the government, or sent overseas for work by a business that has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, and borrowers have a permanent place of abode only in New Zealand • • receiving a qualifying government-funded scholarship for study or an internship • • living in Niue, Cook Islands, Tokelau or Ross Dependency • • have a serious illness, injury or disability that means you’re not able to engage in paid work nor meet your repayment obligation. 20. Further information on how the make an application can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/student-loans/when-can-i-keep-my-student-loan-interest-free-overseas Hardship relief: serious hardship or other special reasons 21. Applications for relief are considered on a case-by-case basis. The onus is on the borrower to show that payment of their student loan obligations will cause serious hardship or there is good reason for the Commissioner not to require repayment of their full student loan repayment obligation for a period. Serious hardship 22. If the Commissioner is satisfied a repayment obligation will cause serious hardship to a borrower or there are special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to provide relief, the Commissioner may: • • refund 6 any amount that was paid that is considered more than a borrower can afford to pay without causing hardship; and/or • • adjust the repayment obligation amount to what the borrower can afford without causing serious hardship. 5 Further information on how to make a request is available at the Inland Revenue website www.ird.govt.nz/student-loans/what-happens- to-my-student-loan-when-i-go-overseas/temporary-repayment-suspension-for-student-loans 6 However, any overpayment of a loan repayment obligation for years prior to the year preceding the current year, are not refundable to the borrower and will be offset against the student loan balance (s 122(2)). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 23. The Act does not provide a definition of “serious hardship”. However, s 154 (applications for instalment arrangement) of the Act does refer to s 177A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the “TAA”), which provides what considerations should be made when applying the serious hardship provisions in the TAA. 24. The TAA sets out a list (although not exhaustive) of circumstances that would indicate a taxpayer is experiencing significant financial hardship because of: • • a serious illness suffered by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's dependant(s); or • • the taxpayer’s inability to meet: –minimum living expenses according to normal community standards; or –the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s dependant(s); or –the cost of education for the taxpayer’s dependant(s). 25. T he Commissioner may also consider other factors relevant to whether a taxpayer will experience serious hardship, when deciding if relief should be provided, and the extent of such relief. Other special reasons 26. The Commissioner can grant relief from a repayment obligation if satisfied there are “other special reasons” that make it fair and reasonable to do so. 27. Providing relief because a borrower perceives their repayment obligation as unfair or unreasonable, is not a sufficient reason to apply the “other special reason” relief without first explaining how the unfair or unreasonable situation, led to hardship. 28. C onsideration of what is fair and reasonable should have regard to the perception of other borrowers who are meeting their repayment obligations. Examples of relief under “serious hardship” and “other special reasons” Example 1 Relief is likely to be granted under “serious hardship” where a borrower’s partner (the household primary income earner) experiences a severe health problem and is on medical leave without any income for 8 months to recuperate. In the interim, their partner (a student loan borrower) claims hardship as they struggle to support a family household and extra costs of medical treatment, on their modest wage income. After looking at the borrower’s financial situation and being satisfied no other payment option is available, the Commissioner will likely agree hardship is being experienced and provide relief from their current loan repayment obligation. The borrower is required to advise the Commissioner of any change or improvement to their financial circumstances that impact on their ability to make loan repayments. Example 2 A borrower has received a lump sum payment from the Accident Compensation Corporation to provide for alterations to their home to improve the borrower’s mobility around their home. The borrower has unpaid student loan obligations for the previous year which they have no prospect of making an immediate payment of the loan debt. As the ACC lump sum payment has a specified purpose of promoting a borrower’s mobility and preserve their independent living standard, the Commissioner will consider relief under the other special reasons provision. The borrower’s repayment obligation would likely be reassessed to what they can afford to pay and the unpaid balance would remain as part of the loan balance. Example 3 A borrower has access to savings, but they intend to use those funds as a deposit to purchase a house. The Commissioner is unlikely to provide relief when funds are available to pay a debt. In considering this, the Commissioner will give regard to promoting compliance, maintaining the integrity of the tax administration and that other borrowers would have reduced savings as a consequence of meeting their repayment obligations. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Entering into an instalment arrangement 29. As noted above, borrowers who are likely to experience hardship in meeting their repayment obligations are encouraged to contact Inland Revenue early to obtain an agreed solution, particularly as late payment interest is charged on defaulted repayment obligations. Early contact may minimise late payment interest charged on any amount that remains unpaid after the due date for payment. 30. W hen a borrower complies with an agreed instalment arrangement, a lower late payment interest rate 7 will apply to the unpaid amount for each month while an instalment arrangement applies. 31. The Commissioner may agree to an instalment arrangement where a borrower can demonstrate that they will experience hardship if they are required to pay their repayment obligation in full but can make a partial payment. 32. T he Act imposes no time limit on when an instalment arrangement must be completed. However, the Commissioner considers that instalment arrangements should be for as short a period as possible without causing serious hardship to a borrower. 33. When the Commissioner enters into an instalment arrangement, the terms will be confirmed with the borrower via myIR or by letter to ensure that both parties clearly understand their obligations and for future reference by the borrower. 34. A b orrower may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time. However, the Commissioner may only do so after two years have elapsed from the date the instalment arrangement was entered, as long as the borrower maintains the terms of their arrangement. Refund amount paid 35. The Commissioner may refund any amount paid to meet a student loan repayment obligation, limited to the current tax year and the previous tax year, where that repayment will cause serious hardship, or there are other special reasons that would make it fair and reasonable to make a refund. Relief from late payment interest and penalties 36. A penalty and late payment interest may be imposed if a borrower does not meet their student loan repayment obligations in full and on-time. Late payment interest will also compound monthly until the arrears are paid. 37. U pon application, and depending on the borrower’s circumstances, the Commissioner can cancel some or all of the late payment interest if it would be equitable to do so. The Commissioner will only consider an application for the cancellation of a penalty and late payment interest once the initial repayment obligation has been paid. 38. T he Commissioner has no discretion to cancel base interest charged on student loans held by overseas based borrowers, that will remain payable. 39. The Commissioner will cancel a penalty and late payment interest when it is considered equitable to so do, after looking at the reasons for late payment. For example, a penalty and late payment interest may be cancelled when a payment default was: • • the result of a genuine error; • • beyond the control of the borrower or the borrower’s agent; or • • any other situation in which the Commissioner considers it is equitable to do so. 40. When considering an application to cancel a penalty or late payment interest, the Commissioner will consider the borrower’s previous loan repayment record, including whether they have paid their student loan repayment obligations as soon as practicable. The borrower’s overall loan compliance history will also be a factor in deciding whether to cancel late payment interest. Consideration of requests for relief 41. Where it is apparent a borrower can pay overdue repayment obligations immediately, the Commissioner will not enter into an arrangement. For example, if the borrower has access to investment funds, beneficial interests, shareholder current accounts or trusts, the Commissioner expects those funds will be used to pay the overdue repayment obligation. A decision will be based on the financial information provided by a borrower along with any further enquiries the Commissioner considers necessary. 7 When a borrower meets their obligations in an instalment arrangement, late payment interest payable is reduced from the base rate plus 4% to the base rate plus 2% interest. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 42. The Commissioner will look at all options available for collection of unpaid repayment obligations when considering a request for relief. Options may include requesting that the borrower sells assets or arranges other finance to pay their unpaid repayment obligations more promptly. 43. Despite any application for relief, the Commissioner may make a counteroffer based on the information available and what is considered appropriate for a borrower’s circumstances. 44. I f the Commissioner is satisfied that meeting a repayment obligation will cause serious hardship to a borrower or there are special reasons that make it fair and reasonable to provide relief, the Commissioner may: • • refund 8 any amount that had been paid that is considered more than a borrower should have been expected to pay without causing hardship, and/or • • reduce the amount that must be paid, and so enable the borrower to meet their adjusted repayment obligation. 45. T he unpaid balance of the original student loan repayment obligation that is not recovered when providing hardship relief, remains as part of the loan account. 46. When the Commissioner agrees to provide relief, the terms and details of the adjusted student loan repayment obligation and other matters (eg, refunds, changed tax code for PAYE purposes) will also be confirmed, with a borrower or a nominated contact person by letter. If registered for myIR they will receive a notification of this letter to view in their account unless they have asked communications to be directed to a tax agent. Reviewing a decision Change in circumstances (for a reduced payment obligation) 47. Borrowers, who are under a current relief arrangement, must notify the Commissioner if there is a change in their circumstances. The Commissioner may review any decision to grant relief if it is considered there has been a material change in the circumstances upon which the relief had been agreed. 48. A change in circumstances, includes any information given to the Commissioner that is no longer correct, or likely impact on whether hardship relief will continue to be granted. Upon review, all or part of a repayment obligation may be reinstated by the Commissioner. Misleading or false information 49. The Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement if a borrower had provided false or misleading information, or a borrower is not meeting their obligations under an instalment arrangement. Service feedback 50. If a borrower is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern with the staff member that considered their request and ask for the decision to be reviewed by a more senior officer. 51. If a borrower is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue complaints management service at www.ird.govt.nz/contactus/complaints-disputes-compliments/complaints or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm). Challenges 52. A borrower may challenge a decision 9 by the Commissioner to not to grant relief or enter into an instalment arrangement by commencing proceedings to the Taxation Review Authority, on the ground that the decision is not fair and reasonable. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 10 November 2020. Rob Falk National Advisor, Technical Standards - Legal Services 8 However, any overpayment of a loan repayment obligation for years prior to the year preceding the current year, are not refundable to the borrower and will be offset against the student loan balance (see section 122(2)). 9 Dispute process must be completed before challenge is made.

CSUM 20/12: Debut Homes Ltd (in liquidation) v Cooper CaseVivien Judith Madsen-Reis and Henry David Levin as Liquidators of Debut Homes Limited (in Liquidation) and Debut Homes Limited (in Liquidation) v Leonard Wayne Cooper and Leonard Wayne Cooper and Tracey Cooper as Trustees of the L & T Cooper Family Trust \[2020\] NZSC 100 Decision date24 September 2020 Legislative ReferencesCompanies Act 1993, ss 131, 135, 136, and 301 Legal termsDirectors duties, solvency, reckless trading, best interests of the company, incurring obligations, breach of duty, interest of creditors, compensation, “rob Peter to pay Paul”. Summary This Judgment sets out the scheme of the Companies Act 1993 (“the Act”) and the underlying principles for assessing whether a director has breached their duties under ss 131 (duty to act in the best interests of the company), 135 (reckless trading), 136 (duty not to incur obligations without reasonable grounds to believe the company can meet them when they fall due) and the correct approach to determining the compensation to be ordered under s 301. The Appeal was allowed. Impact This has a significant impact on clarifying when the actions of will be in breach of their duties under the Act. In particular, directors must consider the interests of creditors in cases of near insolvency. It also confirmed that s 136 applies in respect of all debts incurred, not only contractual debts, otherwise the situation would allow Peter to be robbed to pay Paul. The effect of this decision is that if the director incurred GST when they knew that it could not be paid, this was a breach of duty under s 136. The approach to the calculation of compensation under s 301 was confirmed as a two-step approach. Facts Debut Homes Ltd (“Debut”) was a property development company and had been balance sheet insolvent since 2009 but by October 2012 was in serious financial difficulty and unable to pay its debts. In November 2012 its director, Mr Cooper, sought advice from his accountant and it was clear that the company debt was insurmountable. A GST debt to Inland Revenue was expected to be $300,000 at that stage. Debut still owned six properties, all at various stages of completion. Mr Cooper made the decision to complete these properties on the belief that they would sell for a higher price once they were completed rather than if they were sold incomplete. Mr Cooper obtained further finance to complete the building projects which he personally guaranteed and also obtained a loan from his family trust, subject a general security agreement. The properties were sold, and the sale proceeds used to pay secured creditors, but no GST was paid on any of the property sales. Inland Revenue applied to liquidate the company and in 2014 and at the time of the liquidation Debut owed approx. $499,000 to its creditors, of which approx. $450,000 was owed to Inland Revenue for unpaid GST on property sales. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 17 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES Issues Whether the Court of Appeal decision was in error. Specific issues included: • • Whether continuing to trade to complete the unfinished properties and incur further debts was a breach of duty under ss 131, 135 and 136. • • Whether creditors interests had to be considered by directors in cases of near insolvency • • Whether incurring GST was the type of debt that was captured under s 136 • • The correct approach to calculating compensation Decision The appeal was allowed. The full court made the following observations about the scheme of the Companies Act in general: • • Under the scheme of the Act, maintaining solvency is the key value in the Act and vital to the best interests of the company. • • In cases of near solvency, the interests of creditors must be considered. • • The formal mechanisms within the Act and the informal mechanisms of maintaining solvency all involve consultation and agreement with creditors. • • Directors may be compromised and where they have an interest (e.g. a security) in resolving the company debt. Section 135 The Court took the view that contrary to the Court of Appeal’s decision, it cannot sensibly be said that completing the properties benefitted Inland Revenue because higher sale prices would increase the GST payable, given that it was clear there was no intention or ability to pay GST on the sales of the properties. If a company reaches the point where continued trading will result in a shortfall to creditors and the company is not salvageable, then continued trading will be in breach of s 135 of the Act. Subject to the use of the formal or informal mechanisms elsewhere discussed, this applies whether or not continued trading is projected to result in higher returns to some of the creditors than would be the case if the company had been immediately placed into liquidation, and whether or not any overall deficit was projected to be reduced. Section 136 The Court held that as GST is payable at the time of supply, the obligation did not arise at the time the properties were purchased, there is no debt to Inland Revenue until the time they are sold. It is not legitimate to take a course of action where some creditors have a higher return than others at the expense of new creditors not being paid, that it is not legitimate to “rob Peter to pay Paul”. If directors agree to debts being incurred where they do not believe on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligations when they fall due, then there will be a breach of s 136 of the Act. Such obligations do not need to arise from direct contractual arrangements between the company and the creditor. Section 131 In cases of near insolvency, a director must consider the interests of creditors. There will be no breach of s 131 if a director honestly believed they were acting in the best interests of the company. There will, however, be a breach of s 131 if directors, in an insolvency or near-insolvency situation, fail to consider the interests of all creditors. Such a breach may be exacerbated by a conflict of interest. Where there are no prospects of a company returning to solvency, it makes no difference that a director honestly thought some of the creditors would be better off by continuing trading. There are alternatives other than liquidation open to directors where continued trading is projected to result in a shortfall. The formal mechanisms available include those in Parts 14 and 15A of the Act. Section 301 Where there have been breaches of duties, any relief ordered under s 301 must respond to and provide redress for the particular duty or combination of duties breached. Relief can be compensatory or restitutionary in nature and must take account of all of the circumstances, including the nature of the breach or breaches, the level of culpability of the director, causation, duration of the breach, holding the director to account and reversing the harm to the company. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 11 December 2020 Inland Revenue Department 18 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE SUMMARIES For breaches of s 135 the starting point is the net deterioration in the company’s financial position between the date it should have stopped trading and the date of actual liquidation. For breaches of s 136 the net deterioration method will not necessarily respond adequately to the breach, especially where new obligations are incurred and “Peter has been robbed to pay Paul”. There the net deterioration will not reflect the harm. Any relief should therefore be restitutionary. Other findings The Court considered that the GSA should be set aside as the GSA would frustrate the purpose of the judgment if it would enable to family trust to claim the benefit of the judgment by returning any compensation paid by Debut to Mr Coopers as a beneficiary of the trust. Mr Cooper could not rely on s 138 as the accountant’s advice was too general and the forecast of $300,000 GST debt was unsurmountable.

LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS LIVESTOCK VALUES – 2020 NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released a determination, reproduced below, setting the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2019–2020 income year. These costs are used by farmers as part of the calculation of the value of livestock on hand at the end of the income year, where they have adopted the national standard cost (“NSC”) scheme to value any class of specified livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply the rising one-year NSC to stock bred on the farm each year, and add the rising two-year NSC to the value of the opening young stock available to come through into the mature inventory group at year-end. The cost of livestock purchased are also factored into the valuation of the immature and mature groupings at year-end, so as to arrive at a valuation reflecting the enterprise’s own balance of farm bred and externally purchased animals. NSCs are developed from independent survey data of national average costs of production for each type of livestock. Only direct costs of breeding and rearing rising one-year and two-year livestock are taken into account. These exclude all costs of owning (leasing) and operating the farm business, overheads, costs of operating non-livestock enterprises (such as cropping) and costs associated with producing and harvesting dual products (wool, fibre, milk and velvet). For bobby calves, information from spring 2019 is used while other dairy NSCs are based on the 2018-2019 income and expenditure from a DairyBase sample of owner-operated dairy farms. For sheep, beef cattle, deer and goats, NSCs are based on survey data from the 2017-2018 sheep and beef farm survey conducted by the Beef & Lamb New Zealand Economic Service. This is the most recent information available for those livestock types at the time the NSCs are calculated in December 2019. For the 2019–2020 income year the NSCs for all livestock types except dairy goats have remained reasonably static when compared to the previous year. There has been a substantial increase in NSCs for dairy goats. This has come about because of a change in the calculation methodology in the 2017-2018 year. In recent years the dairy goat farming industry has changed from a largely pasture based model to primarily a housed farming system. As a result of these changes, the NSC formula was updated to take account of the different costs structure attributable to this housed farming model. The resultant increase in costs is being phased in over three years and commenced with the 2017-2018 income year. 2020 is the final year of change to the new dairy goat valuation model. This being so, the 2020 NSC values for dairy goats have been arrived based solely on costs incurred by the housed goat system. The NSCs calculated each year only apply to that year’s immature and maturing livestock. Mature livestock valued under this scheme retain their historic NSCs until they are sold or otherwise disposed of, albeit through a FIFO or inventory averaging system as opposed to individual livestock tracing. It should be noted that the NSCs reflect the national average costs of breeding and raising immature livestock and will not necessarily bear any relationship to either the market values (at balance date) of these livestock classes or the costs of production of any individual farmer. In particular, some livestock types, such as dairy cattle, may not obtain a market value in excess of the NSC until they reach the mature age grouping. One-off movements in expenditure items are effectively smoothed within the mature inventory grouping, by the averaging of that year’s intake value with the carried forward values of the surviving livestock in that grouping. For the farm-bred component of the immature inventory group, the NSC values will appropriately reflect changes in the costs of production of those livestock in that particular year. The NSC scheme is only one option under the current livestock valuation regime. The other options are market value, replacement value, the herd scheme and the self-assessed cost scheme (“SAC”) option. SAC is calculated on the same basis as NSC but uses a farmer’s own costs rather than the national average costs. There are restrictions in changing from one scheme to another and before considering such a change farmers may wish to discuss the issue with their accountant or other adviser. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination 2020 This determination may be cited as "The National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination 2020". This determination is made in terms of section EC 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates their tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see Binding rulings: How to get certainty on the tax position of your transaction (IR715). You can download this publication free from our website at www.ird.govt.nz BINDING RULINGS BR Prd 19/03: StockCo Limited This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by StockCo Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, DA 1(1), DA 2, EA 3, EJ 10, FA 6 to FA 11, FA 12, GA 1 and subpart EW. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement The Arrangement is the leasing of livestock by StockCo Limited (StockCo) to its customers (Customers) to use in a farming business. Each Customer will be a “New Zealand resident” (as defined in s YA 1). The leased livestock will either be purchased by StockCo from the Customer and will then be leased back to them, or will be specifically purchased by StockCo from a third party and then leased to the Customer. The Customer will lease the livestock over a period of usually four years. The livestock will be progressively culled (or will otherwise go missing or die) over the period of the Lease, with cull payments being returned to StockCo. Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. The Purchase of Livestock 1. StockCo will purchase an agreed number of “specified livestock” (as defined in s YA 1), in this case cows, from the Customer, or a third party, for the purchase price (Purchase Price): WE WILL PURCHASE THE HERD 4 We will purchase the Cows specified in each Lease Agreement for the Purchase Price detailed in the Lease Agreement on the Commencement Date. 5 When we purchase Cows from you we will create a buyer generated invoice. 6 We are purchasing the Cows at your request. You are responsible for inspecting and approving all Cows prior to us purchasing them. ... 2. The Purchase Price is the equivalent of the market value of the purchased cows at the time of acquisition. 3. Where the livestock are purchased from a third party, the Purchase Price will be paid by StockCo to the third party vendor. 4. The Customer will apply the Purchase Price to debt or other farming costs (such as expanding their farming operations or covering other business related costs). The Lease 5. The Agreement entered into between StockCo and its customers comprises of two documents: the Dairy Herd Lease Master Terms (Master Terms) and the Lease Agreement (Lease Agreement) (together, the Lease). The Lease sets out the terms of the sale (where StockCo purchases livestock from the Customer) and the lease of the livestock. 6. The terms of the Lease Agreement and the Master Terms will not be materially different from the version provided to Inland Revenue on 25 October 2019. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 BINDING RULINGS 7. As provided for in clause 7 of the Master Terms, StockCo owns the cows and leases the purchased cows to the Customer for the lease period, while the Customer owns all milk and progeny produced by the leased cows: 7 We will own the Cows. You will own all progeny and milk produced by the Cows during the Lease period. WE WILL LEASE YOU THE HERD 8 We lease to you, and you take on lease, the Herd for the term specified in the Lease Agreement from the time we purchase the Herd. 8. The progeny will be valued in accordance with the livestock valuation rules set out in Part EC of the Act. 9. Clauses 11 to 13 of the Master Terms set out the payment obligations of the Customer: YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS 11 You will pay us for each Herd: 11.1 Lease Payments: the Lease Payments as set out in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Lease Payments are the rent payable for the lease of the Herd. 11.2 Cull Payments: the Cull Payments as set out in the relevant Lease Agreement. (a) The Cull Payments are the amounts we agree to realise from Cull Cows when they are culled. You agree to realise this amount for us by selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. (b) You will pay us the Cull Payments regardless of the amount you realise from selling the Cull Cows on our behalf. If you realise more than the Cull Payments you may keep the additional amount. 12 On the Commencement Date (or as otherwise specified) you will also pay us any establishment fee or other fee specified in a Lease Agreement. 13 You will provide us with a signed Dairy Order so that the Lease Payments are paid directly to us by the Dairy Company. 10. Under clause 13 the Customer must arrange for the Lease Payments to be made directly to StockCo by the Dairy Company (defined in clause 59 of the Master Terms as “Fonterra”). Accordingly, only Fonterra members are eligible to enter into the Agreement. 11. The Customer will use the livestock valuation regime in subpart EC of the Act to determine the value of the leased livestock. Early Termination of the Lease and Events of Default 12. Clause 21 of the Master Terms provides for the early termination of the Lease by the customer in certain situations: EARLY TERMINATION 21 Where there is a material change in your circumstances, you may terminate the Lease early by: 21.1 purchasing the remainder of the Herd for the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; and 21.2 paying us any other amount owing to us under this agreement in relation to the relevant Lease; or 13. It is expected that this clause would be applied only in rare cases as a cost/benefit analysis would normally favour the Customer remaining in the lease and continuing to meet the Lease obligations. 14. Clause 22 of the Master Terms provides for early termination by StockCo: 22 We can end the Lease under clause 25.2 because of your default. 15. Clause 25.2 of the Master Terms states: 25 If an Event of Default has occurred, we may: ... 25.2 end the Lease with effect from any date specified by us and require you to, at our option: (a) return the Herd to us at the location and by the date nominated by us. If we end the Lease under this clause 25.2(a) you will pay us liquidated damages equal to the amount (if any) by which the market value of the Herd (as determined by us, acting reasonably) is less than the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments; or (b) purchase the Herd for the sum of the Net Present Value of the unpaid Lease Payments and Cull Payments. 16. Clause 25.1 allows for StockCo to repossess the Herd or any Cows following an Event of Default: 25.1 enter the Land (or any land where we consider the Herd or any Cows may be) without notice and repossess any or all of the Cows; ... 17. This Ruling does not consider or rule on Early Termination or Events of Default that occur as part of the Arrangement. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 BINDING RULINGS Return of the leased cows 18. The leased cows are returned to StockCo by way of an agreed culling process over the term of the lease. In this respect clauses 9 and 10 of the Master Terms state: YOU WILL CULL THE COWS ON OUR BEHALF 9 We recognise that the Herd will progressively reach the end of its useful milking life over the Lease period. 10 You agree to reduce the Herd to zero over the Lease period at the approximate Annual Cull Rate specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. The Annual Cull Amount Due has been determined on the basis of the Annual Cull Rate and Cull Value specified in the relevant Lease Agreement. 19. Despite clause 10, it is acknowledged in the Lease that cows may die or go missing. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Lease set out terms relating to missing and dead cows: MISSING AND DEAD COWS 15 We understand that deaths occur and that Cows may go missing. We have included an annual death and missing cow allowance of 2.5% of the Herd within the Lease Payment calculation. 16 You agree that the Cows are at your sole risk. You must pay the Lease Payments and Cull Payments regardless of anything else, including the reason for, or the number of, deaths or missing cows. 20. A dairy herd generally loses approximately 25% of its mature cows annually through culling of the older cows and natural attrition. Therefore, it is expected that none of the leased livestock will remain at the end of the Lease period. Deferred Cull Payment 21. The amount and timing of the Cull Payments are agreed at the time of entering into the Lease and is reflected in the Payment Schedule. As the amounts payable are fixed the Customer takes on the risk of under-recovery from the meat works on the culled cows but gets the benefit of any over-recovery. 22. The frequency and timing of the Cull Payments are negotiated between the Customer and StockCo, but payment will generally be either at the time the livestock are culled, or deferred until the end of the Lease term and paid as a lump sum. 23. As legal ownership of the Cull Payments remains with StockCo, it will return the Cull Payments as income in the year in which those payments are derived. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The lease payments are deductible under s DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in s DA 2 applies to prevent deductibility, provided that: no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction under s DA (1). b) At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, s EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments to be included in the Customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the Customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year, provided that the Lease is not “revenue account property” or “trading stock” (within the meaning of s YA 1) of the Customer. c) The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is an excepted financial arrangement. d) Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement. e) Sections FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not a finance lease. f) Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not a hire purchase agreement. g) Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to negate or vary the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on the date this Ruling is signed and ending on 31 December 2023. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19 th day of December 2019. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT The purpose of a Commissioner’s Statement is to inform taxpayers of the Commissioner’s position and the operational approach being adopted on a particular tax matter. A Commissioner’s Statement is not a consultative document. COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT CS 20/01: GST liability for insurance and settlement payments to third party claimants – Section 5(13) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 All legislative references are to the Good and Services Tax Act 1985 (the Act). Summary This Statement confirms the Commissioner’s long-standing position on the GST liability of a GST registered third party claimant when they receive a payment for damages or loss incurred, including by way of settlement agreement, under a contract of insurance. The Commissioner’s position is, and has been for many years, that when an insurer of an insured person pays an amount to a GST-registered third party claimant, in relation to a claim that the third party claimant has against the insured person, and the other requirements of section 5(13) of the Act are met, then the third party claimant must return GST on the receipt of that payment. Background It was recently identified that there has been confusion by some taxpayers as to whether or not a third party claimant has a GST liability under section 5(13) of the Act when an insured person’s insurer pays an amount directly to a third party claimant in settlement of the insured person’s liability to the third party claimant. Some taxpayers considered that the wording in section 5(13) meant that if an insurer made a payment to a GST registered third party claimant rather than to the GST registered insured person, the insurer was entitled to an input tax credit under section 20(3)(d), but the third party claimant did not incur a corresponding output tax liability. The Commissioner considers this latter assertion to be incorrect. Explanation Section 5(13) of the Act provides: For the purposes of this Act, except for subsection (13B) and section 20(3), if a registered person receives a payment under a contract of insurance, whether or not the person is a party to the contract, the payment is, to the extent that it relates to a loss incurred in the course or furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity, deemed to be consideration received for a supply of services performed by the registered person – (a) On the day the registered person receives the payment; and (b) In the course or furtherance of the registered person’s taxable activity: provided that this subsection shall not apply in respect of any payment received pursuant to a contract of insurance where – (a) The supply of that contract of insurance is not a supply charged with tax pursuant to section 8(1); or (b) That payment is in respect of an entitlement for any loss of earnings (being earnings within the meaning of the Accident Compensation Act 1982 or the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 2001); or (c) The supply of the contract of insurance is a supply that is chargeable with tax only because sections 5B and 8(4B) apply to it; or (d) The supply of the contract of insurance is a supply of remote services that is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). When interpreting section 5(13), the Commissioner considers that the word “receives” as used in section 5(13), is intended to have a more constrained meaning, restricted to “actual” receipt of a payment (by the GST registered third party claimant) under a contract of insurance rather than any “constructive receipt” by the insured person. It is considered that “receives” also has the meaning of “being paid”. Therefore, a third party claimant of a damages payment funded by the liability insurer of the insured person is “being paid” when they obtain a cheque, cash or have their bank account credited with that sum. Assuming that the relevant amount is being paid under a contract of insurance, then the third party clearly “receives” the payment within the meaning of section 5(13). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 The word “under” as provided for in section 5(13) requires a broad interpretation. This is reinforced by the words that follow that – “whether or not the person is a party to the contract \[of insurance\]”. These words confirm that a person receiving a payment under a contract of insurance might not be a party to that contract. It is consistent with this to take the view that the focus is on whether the payer of the payment is doing so under a contract of insurance rather than whether the recipient receives the payment under that contract or under another agreement (such as a settlement agreement). Amounts payable by an insurance company in an arrangement, are still amounts payable under the original insurance contract. It is just the quantification of the amount due under that contract that is fixed by the settlement agreement between the insured party and the third party claimant. The quantification of the sum due by the settlement agreement does not remove the liability of the insurance company under the insurance contract. The Commissioner considers that this supports the view that “under” relates to a payment consequential on a claim under an insurance contract, even if quantification of the amount to be paid is determined by a separate settlement agreement. The existence of a settlement agreement is not sufficient to break the connection between the payment to the third party claimant and the contract of insurance. The Commissioner’s position is that when an insurer of an insured person pays an amount to a GST-registered third party claimant, in relation to a claim that the third party claimant has against the insured person, and the other requirements of section 5(13) of the Act are met, then the third party claimant must return GST on the receipt of that payment. Example: While driving between plumbing jobs, Joe Bloggs accidently drove over Farmer Fred’s fence causing significant damage. In settlement of Joe’s liability to Fred for the loss incurred, Joe’s insurer, AGHY Insurance Ltd, pays Fred $5,000 in settlement of Fred’s claim under the contract of insurance. AGHY Insurance Ltd is entitled to a GST input tax credit. Fred, as a GST registered farmer, must return GST on the payment received from AGHY Insurance Ltd. Application This Statement confirms the Commissioner’s long-standing position (which has been applied for many years) on the application of section 5(13) of the Act. As there has been no change in the Commissioner’s position on this issue, the Commissioner will continue to apply this position to all cases, whether past, present or future. If you have any concerns about your compliance with the tax obligations outlined in this Statement, you should discuss this matter with a tax professional or contact Inland Revenue to make a voluntary disclosure. Vanessa Montgomery National Advisor, Escalations Technical Standards, Legal Services Date of issue: 03 February 2020 COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS SPS 20/01: Tax payments – when received in time Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time. With the influence of technology there has been a significant shift in practice to use digital methods for making tax payments. The Commissioner encourages customers to use direct banking facilities when they make tax payments (or when refunds are issued). The table below outlines the payment options for customers, to make payments to Inland Revenue: Payment optionsYou’ll need Pay online in myIR - Debit or credit card payments, or - Set up a direct debit (immediate payment or future dated) www.ird.govt.nz/myIR to login or register IRD number Tax/product type Payment period Authorise IR to take direct debit payment from bank Pay on our secure payment website - Debit or credit card payments www.ird.govt.nz search ‘make a payment’ IRD number Tax/product type Payment period Pay using internet bankingIRD number Tax/product type Payment period Authorise the bank to make one-off or regular payments Pay through Westpac (you don’t need to be a Westpac customer) - EFTPOS or cash Counter payment - IRD number - Tax/product type - Payment period - Use Smart ATM (Westpac customers only)- Barcode (off return or IR statement) or create your own at www.ird.govt.nz/barcode Pay through your bank - Phone or visit your bank to discuss options - Examples, direct credit, automatic payment\* and phone banking \* Automatic payment allows for 2 people to sign, one-off or regular payments IRD number Tax/product type Payment period Pay IR by phone - Credit and debit card - Domestic direct debits IRD number Tax/product type Payment period Pay by post - Cheque (exception arrangement) Prior IR approval necessary IRD number Tax/product type Payment period It is important to make your payment by the due date to avoid penalties or interest.

Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 9 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Application This Statement applies from the date of signing. It replaces SPS 19/01 Tax payments – when received in time, which was published in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 31, No 3 (April 2019). Standard practice Summary 1. This Statement sets out when the Commissioner will accept a payment as having been received in time, including:   New Zealand electronic payments   debit/credit cards   Westpac over-the-counter payments   tax pooling   overseas electronic payments   tax transfers   payments by cheque   Income Equalisation Scheme deposits and primary sector business customers   weekends and public holidays Detailed discussion 2. This Statement applies to all tax types, as well as student loan repayments and child support payments (payment of tax). New Zealand electronic payments 3. Customers are encouraged to make payments electronically, including by internet banking. Payments by this method minimises delays and include formal notification of the date and time payment was made to Inland Revenue. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date. To ensure payment is received in time, you may need to be familiar with your bank’s processing schedule. 4. A customer is able to future-date an electronic payment by using the “my tax payment” option available with all major New Zealand bank’s internet banking service. 5. Customers who are registered for myIR can set up direct debits (except for child support payments). A direct debit payment will be received in time when the direct debit transaction is made on or before the New Zealand due date. 6. Tax agents who are registered for myIR can set up instalment arrangements and one-off payments on behalf of their clients (who are registered for myIR) by direct debit, with client authorisation and assistance with making related bank arrangements. Debit/credit cards 7. Customers can make payment by using a (Visa or Mastercard only) debit/credit card over the phone to Inland Revenue, through the payment page on the IR website and through myIR, our secure online service. 8. A convenience fee of 1.42% is payable (charged by the banks) on all debit/credit card tax payments made. This fee also applies to debit/credit card payments from an overseas bank, except for payments of child support debt and student loan repayments where Inland Revenue pays the convenience fee. 9. A debit/credit card payment will be received in time when it has been paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account on or before the New Zealand due date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Westpac over-the-counter payments 10. Payments cannot be accepted over-the-counter at an Inland Revenue office. Westpac bank is authorised to receive over- the-counter payments on behalf of Inland Revenue. 11. From 1 July 2020, over-the-counter payments at a Westpac branch must either include a barcode obtained from letters, returns \[1\] , and statements issued by Inland Revenue, or a barcode created through the Inland Revenue website \[2\] to provide clear payment instructions. A separate barcode is required for each individual tax type payable and tax period. 12. Customers with a Westpac bank account may pay (cash or EFTPOS) via Westpac Smart ATMs. Customers making payments at a Westpac smartATM must also use a barcode obtained from letters, returns \[3\] , and statements issued by Inland Revenue, or a barcode generated online \[4\] 13. Payments made at Westpac are received in time if they are made on or before the due date. Tax pooling 14. Tax pooling involves customers depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary who then deposits that money into a tax pooling account with Inland Revenue. These deposits are not tax payments at this stage. When a payment is transferred from the tax pooling account into a taxpayer’s tax account it becomes a tax payment. 15. The date of payment to Inland Revenue is triggered when the tax pooling deposit is transferred into a taxpayer’s account. The effective date of the transfer can be no earlier than the date the tax pool deposit was received by Inland Revenue. 16. For more information on the implications of tax pooling see Tax Information Bulletins \[5\] , Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) pages 64 to 67, Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011) pages 35 to 55 and Vol. 29, No. 5 (June 2017) pages 148 to 149. Overseas electronic payments 17. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date. 18. For more information about making payments from overseas visit www.ird.govt.nz/makepayment/overseas/ from-overseas-index.html Tax transfers 19. For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes refer to Tax Information Bulletins, Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002) pages 35 to 47, Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004) page 71 and Vol. 17, No. 1 (February 2005) pages 101 to 102. Payments by cheque 20. From 1 March 2020, Inland Revenue will no longer accept cheques as a method for payment of tax. Customers are expected to explore and use other bank services available for making payments. 21. The Commissioner may agree in exceptional circumstances to continue to receive a payment by cheque where a customer is unable to pay by any other means. Customers who consider that none of the other options for paying tax is practicable for them should contact the Commissioner explaining why they cannot use one of the current options and so wish to continue to pay their tax using cheques. Each situation will be considered on a customer’s individual circumstances. Example 1: Alternative payment method available Mary is 75 and lives in a remote area. She does not have access to the internet and there is no Westpac branch close by. Mary does have a landline and an EFTPOS card. Through discussion with the customer about her circumstances, it was agreed that she is able to (with assistance by phone) set up a direct debit with us, or make payments using an Automatic Payments form. On this basis, an exceptions arrangement to pay tax by cheque post 1 March 2020 would be declined. \[1\] While payment of tax may be made at Westpac branches, Westpac is not authorised to accept returns. Returns may be filed electronically, posted to Inland Revenue or delivered to an Inland Revenue office. \[2\] Through Inland Revenues website payment page at www.ird.govt.nz/make-a-payment/paying-at-westpac or www.ird.govt.nz/barcode \[3\] While payment of tax may be made at Westpac branches, Westpac is not authorised to accept returns. Returns may be filed electronically, posted to Inland Revenue or delivered to an Inland Revenue office. \[4\] Through Inland Revenues website payment page – refer note 2 above. \[5\] Tax Information Bulletins can be found at www.classic.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/tib/ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Example 2: Agreed cheque exception arrangement Jock lives in a remote rural area and lives off-the-grid. He does not have access to the internet or a reliable phone service and is many hours from any bank services. His only contact with Inland Revenue is through a Post Office box service from which he collects mail infrequently. The Commissioner would agree his circumstances are exceptional and that he may continue to pay tax by cheque post 1 March 2020. 22. Requests for approval to continue paying by cheque can be made by telephone, SecureMail (log in to myIR), by post and at face to face appointments with Inland Revenue. It is important that requests for cheque exception arrangements made via myIR include customer phone contact details (where possible), should Inland Revenue want to further discuss alternative payment options with them. Customers that are unable to provide phone contact details will be sent a response via myIR (if registered) or by post. Cheques through post 23. Where the Commissioner’s agreement has been given to make cheque payments, cheques must be received on or before the due date irrespective of whether they are posted from within New Zealand or from overseas. Payments by post should be sent to: Inland Revenue, PO Box 39050, Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045. 24. Post-dated cheques will not be accepted as a payment method for tax after 1 March 2020. 25. Cheques will be returned to customers who have not obtained prior agreement from the Commissioner to pay by this method. Physical delivery to Inland Revenue offices 26. Where the Commissioner’s agreement has been given to make cheque payments, cheque payments will be accepted as being received in time if delivered to an Inland Revenue office on or before the close of business on the due date. Income Equalisation Scheme (IES) deposits and primary sector business customers 27. Customers are to continue paying IES by cheque until an alternative payment option is provided. IES customers will be advised when the myPay tax payment upgrade is available to pay IES deposits. Weekends and public holidays 28. If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), a payment will be in time when it is received at a Westpac branch or an Inland Revenue bank account on or before the next working day. 29. The treatment for a provincial anniversary day only applies to those customers located in the province that is celebrating its anniversary day and usually make tax payments in person over-the-counter at Westpac, so are unable to make payment on that day. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 5 February 2020. Rob Falk National Advisor, Technical Standards (Legal Services) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 OPERATIONAL POSITION The purpose of an Operational Position is to outline the legal position that the Commissioner considers is correct for an issue identified and the approach the Commissioner will be taking to applying that position in practice. OPERATIONAL POSITION OP 20/01: Part 10B transfers of excess tax, effective date for ICA entries Under Part 10B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) taxpayers can request the Commissioner to transfer overpaid tax to another period or tax type within their own tax accounts or to the accounts of other entities or associates. They can also sometimes choose a date (the date of transfer) that a transfer of overpaid tax will be effective from. A question has arisen over the effect on the imputation credit account (ICA) of both transferor and transferee companies if an earlier date is chosen (as the TAA allows). It has been identified that in practice taxpayers, and Inland Revenue, have often treated the effective date as the date the transfer is processed rather than requiring adjustments to the ICA back to whatever earlier date has been chosen. The Commissioner considers that the correct position is that an ICA must have entries recorded as at the date of transfer ie. the effective date chosen. It is not appropriate to record the entries as at the date Inland Revenue processes the request to transfer excess tax. This conclusion is consistent with the explanation of the transfer rules in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). It may mean, however, that adjustments need to be made to ICA balances back to the date of transfer and that imputation returns after the date of transfer are no longer correct. The consequences of that could include further income tax, imputation penalty tax and Use of Money Interest for the transferor company. When making requests for transfers, taxpayers need to consider the possible effects on ICA balances and imputation returns and take them into account to ensure the ICA is correct after the transfer. Operational position The Commissioner will be applying this interpretation to requests for transfers made on or after 5 February 2020. The Commissioner will adjust, and apply the correct view of the law, when an audit or investigation uncovers incorrect ICA entries or where incorrect entries are identified when processing a transfer request to an earlier period. However, the Commissioner will not devote resources to identifying adjustments to ICA accounts and assessments affected by an incorrect transfer date being used for a transfer of excess tax under Part 10B of the TAA where transfers have been requested prior to 5 February 2020. Vanessa Montgomery National Advisor, Escalations Technical Standards, Legal Services Date of issue: 5 February 2020 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 2 March 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 Tax Counsel Office On 17 February the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (“OCTC”) was renamed the Tax Counsel Office. The new Tax Counsel Office (“TCO”) will continue to provide taxpayer rulings, public rulings and other interpretative statements, adjudications of tax disputes, and escalations and advising services. You will not see significant changes to the nature and quality of the TCO’s primary services, but the TCO will operate differently (internally) in several respects to provide timely rulings, guidance and advice on complex matters of law relating to tax and social policy.

In particular, it considers when apportionment will be required. The statement is a re-issue of IS 16/04; in the course of considering some related issues, it came to Inland Revenue’s attention that paragraph \[68\] of IS 16/04 was incorrectly stated as quoting from Case 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603. The quote was instead from the Commentary to Binding Ruling BR Pub 05/12 Taxability of payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings. Paragraph \[68\] has now been corrected and IS 16/04 republished as IS 20/01. 10 Standard practice statement SPS 20/02: Loss offset elections between group companies This standard practice statement updates and replaces SPS 17/03 Loss offset elections between group companies. Example 3 has been expanded to clarify that late loss offset elections can be made where at the original time of filing the loss company’s return, the loss company was unaware of the group companies’ profit outcome. It also recognises that not all additional late loss offsets will result in an amendment to assessments. However, the same rationale as set out in the SPS 16/01 on amending assessments will also apply when the Commissioner considers whether to accept late loss offset elections. 18 Legal decisions – case impact statement Court of Appeal decides forgiveness of debt can be a charitable gift qualifying a taxpayer for donation tax credit This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision that Nancy Lois Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a “charitable or other public benefit gift” within s LD 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) qualifying her for a donation tax credit (Nancy Lois Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2153). The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision and found that: For the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), the term “monetary” means “of or pertaining to money”; - In this context, “monetary” is not limited to include only cash, credit cards, cheques and bank transfers as the Commissioner submitted; - In this context, “monetary” also includes a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities; and - Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a monetary gift that was paid. 24 General article Check out beta version of Tax Technical site now We’re building a new Tax Technical website to help people find tax technical answers more quickly. 27 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 1 N E W L E G I S L AT I O N This section of the TIB covers new legislation, changes to legislation including general and remedial amendments, and Orders in Council. NEW LEGISLATION TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES SETTING PROCESS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2020 Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 An Order in Council has been made to ensure that the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate cannot be set at a negative rate. The Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997 outlines the methodology to be used when setting the use of money interest rates. This has been amended to specify that when setting the Commissioner’s paying rate, that it must be set at the higher of: • • The 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points; or • • 0% In effect, this prevents it being set at a negative rate. Background The use of money interest (“UOMI”) rates are a cornerstone of the tax compliance system in New Zealand. UOMI interest is paid by the taxpayer where tax has been underpaid and by the Commissioner where tax has been overpaid. The rate of UOMI payable for overpaid tax is referred to as the Commissioner’s paying rate. The legislated twin objectives of the UOMI provisions are to: • • fairly compensate the party (either the Crown or the taxpayer) that does not have the use of its money; and • • encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The method used for setting the overpayment rate is outlined in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulation 1997. This method uses the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (“RBNZ”) 90-day bank bill rate minus 100 basis points (1%). When the UOMI rates were last set, at the start of July this year, the UOMI for the Commissioner’s paying rate was reduced to 0.81%, as the 90-day bank bill rate was 1.81%. However, since then, the RBNZ has decreased the Official Cash Rate (“OCR”) further to 1.00. This has caused the 90-day bank bill rate to drop to 1.27% for the month of January 2019. Key features The measure prevents the Commissioner’s use of money interest paying rate being set at a negative rate. Application date(s) The Order in Council came into force on 9 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 2 NEW LEGISLATION TAX ADMINISTRATION (DIRECT CREDIT OF REFUNDS OF EXCESS FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS) ORDER 2020 Sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 An Order in Council has been made to include refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions as tax types refundable by direct credit under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The provisions in sections 184A and 184B require tax refunds to be paid via direct credit to a bank account nominated by the taxpayer and were introduced to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to cheques. Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Refunds of Excess Financial Support and Student Loan Payments) Order 2020 mandates the direct credit of refunds for excess payments of financial support and student loan deductions. Financial support means child support and domestic maintenance as defined in the Child Support Act 1991. Student loan deductions are salary or wage deductions as defined in section 4(1) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Section 184A still allows the Commissioner to provide an exemption when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. Background Compulsory direct crediting for income tax and gaming machine duty was implemented when their administration was moved to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform (START), which modernises and improves information flows, and enables more online self-service and automated processes. The administration of financial support and student loan deductions are to be moved to START in the next phase of Inland Revenue’s business transformation project, planned for April 2020. Whilst the intent was that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds of excess tax paid, the progressive implementation for various tax types through Orders in Council was legislated for to allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to choose the optimal dates to implement direct crediting of refunds for each tax type. Application date(s) The Order in Council comes into effect on 9 April 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 3 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS 2020 International tax disclosure exemption ITR31 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") requires taxpayers to disclose interests in foreign entities. Section 61(1) of the TAA states that a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a foreign investment fund ("FIF") at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. In the case of partnerships, disclosure needs to be made by the individual partners in the partnership. The partnership itself is not required to disclose. Section 61(2) of the TAA allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined in section YA 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA"). To balance the revenue forecasting and risk assessment needs of the Commissioner with the compliance costs of taxpayers providing the information, the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption under section 61(2) of the TAA that applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2020. This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR31 "("the 2020 disclosure exemption") and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 2020 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2019 disclosure exemption. Application date This exemption applies for the income year corresponding to the tax year ended 31 March 2020. Summary In summary, the 2020 disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose: • • An interest of less than 10% in a foreign company if it is not an attributing interest in a FIF or if it falls within the $50,000 de minimis exemption (see section CQ 5(1)(d) and section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA). The de minimis exemption does not apply to a person that has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the income year an amount of FIF income or loss. • • If the resident is not a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10%, if the foreign entity is incorporated (in the case of a company) or otherwise tax resident in a treaty country or territory, and the fair dividend rate or comparative value method of calculation is used. • • If the resident is a widely-held entity, an attributing interest in a FIF that is an income interest of less than 10% if the fair dividend rate or comparative value method is used for the interest. The resident is instead required to disclose the end-of- year New Zealand dollar market value of all such investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed. The 2020 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident or transitional resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 4 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Commentary Generally, residents who hold an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company, or an attributing interest in a FIF are required to disclose these interests to the Commissioner. These interests are considered in further detail below. Attributing interest in a FIF A resident is required to disclose an attributing interest in a FIF if FIF income or a FIF loss arises through the use of one of the following calculation methods: • • attributable FIF income, deemed rate of return or cost methods; or • • fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is a "widely-held entity" or • • fair dividend rate or comparative value methods, if the resident is not a widely-held entity and the attributing interest is incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020. The 40 countries or territories with which New Zealand does have a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020 are listed below. Australia Austria Belgium Canada Chile China Czech Republic Denmark Fiji Finland France Germany Hong Kong India Indonesia Ireland Italy Japan Korea Malaysia Mexico Netherlands Norway Papua New Guinea Philippines Poland Russian Federation Samoa Singapore South Africa Spain Sweden Switzerland Ta i w a n Thailand Tu r k e y United Arab Emirates United Kingdom United States of America Viet Nam For the avoidance of doubt, the term "double tax agreement" does not include tax information exchange agreements or collection agreements and is limited to the double tax agreements negotiated with the 40 countries or territories listed in this 2020 disclosure exemption. No disclosure is required by non-widely-held taxpayers for attributing interests in FIFs that are income interests of less than 10% and are incorporated or otherwise tax resident in a tax treaty country or territory, if the fair dividend rate or comparative value methods of calculation are used. A "widely-held entity" for the purposes of this disclosure is an entity which is a: • • portfolio investment entity (this includes a portfolio investment-linked life fund); or • • widely-held company; or • • widely-held superannuation fund; or • • widely-held group investment fund ("GIF"). Portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund and widely-held GIF are all defined in section YA 1 of the ITA. The disclosure required, by widely-held entities, of attributing interests in FIFs which use the fair dividend rate or the comparative value method of calculation is that, for each calculation method, they disclose the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. In the event that tax residence is not easily determined, a further option of a split by currency in which the investment is held will also be accepted as long as it is a reasonable proxy - that is at least 90-95% accurate - for the underlying jurisdiction in which the FIF is held, listed, organised or managed. Investments denominated in euros will not be able to meet this test and so euro-based investments will need to be split into the underlying jurisdictions. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 5 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS FIF interests The types of interests that fall within the scope of section 61(1) of the TAA are: • • rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (eg, a unit trust) • • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person acquired the interest before 1 April 2014 and treated the interest as a FIF interest in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 and for all subsequent income years • • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme, if a person’s interest in the scheme was first acquired whilst the person was tax resident of New Zealand • • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy • • an interest in an entity specified in schedule 25, part A of the ITA. However, the following interests are exempt (under sections EX 31 to EX 43 of the ITA) from being an attributing interest in a FIF and do not have to be disclosed: • • certain interests in Australian resident companies included on the official list of the Australian Stock Exchange and required to maintain a franking account (refer to Inland Revenue's website www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: other exemptions)) • • certain interests in an Australian unit trust that has a New Zealand RWT proxy with either a high turnover or high distributions • • an interest held by a natural person in a foreign superannuation scheme that is an Australian approved deposit fund, Australian exempt public sector superannuation scheme, Australian regulated superannuation fund or Australian retirement savings account • • an income interest of 10% or more in a controlled foreign company (“CFC”) (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company) • • certain interests of 10% or more in a foreign company that is treated as resident, and subject to tax, in Australia (although separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company) • • an interest in certain venture capital investments in New Zealand resident start-up companies that migrate to a grey-list country • • an interest in certain grey-list companies owning New Zealand venture capital companies • • an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from shares acquired under a venture investment agreement • • an interest in certain grey-list companies resulting from the acquisition of shares under an employee share scheme • • certain interests held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency. • • an interest held by a natural person who is a non-resident or transitional resident • • a beneficial interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was first acquired whilst the person was not a tax resident of New Zealand and which has not been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF by the person • • certain foreign pensions or annuities (see Inland Revenue's guide Overseas pensions and annuity schemes (IR257) for more information). De minimis Interests in foreign entities held by a natural person not acting as a trustee also do not have to be disclosed if the total cost of the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year. This disclosure exemption is made because no FIF income under section CQ 5 of the ITA or FIF loss under section DN 6 of the ITA arises in respect of these interests. This de minimis exemption does not apply to a person who has opted out of the de minimis threshold by including in the income tax return for the year FIF income or loss. Please note that a person opting out of the de minimis threshold is generally required to continue to apply the FIF rules in each subsequent tax year. Where a person has previously opted out of the de minimis threshold, they will be required to apply the FIF rules unless they have less than $50,000 of attributing interests in FIFs for the current year, and for each of the four previous tax years: • • the person had no attributing interests in FIFs (for example, they had no foreign shares, or only had foreign shares which were exempt from the FIF rules); and/or • • the person had more than $50,000 in attributing interests in FIFs (note that for these years they would have been required to apply the FIF rules). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 6 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Format of disclosure The forms for the disclosure of FIF interests are as follows: • • IR443 form for the deemed rate of return method • • IR447 form for the fair dividend rate method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities) • • IR448 form for the comparative value method (for individuals or non-widely-held entities) • • IR449 form for the cost method • • IR458 spreadsheet form (this spreadsheet form can be used to make electronic disclosures for all methods) • • myIR income tax return attachment form (this form can be used to make electronic disclosures for all methods) The IR458 spreadsheet and myIR income tax return attachment forms, which reflect the disclosure options for fair dividend rate and comparative value for widely-held entities, must be filed online. As discussed above these disclosures are by country rather than by individual investment as is the general requirement of section 61 of the TAA. In order to be exempt from the general requirement, these disclosures must be made electronically. As noted above, all other disclosures may be filed using the IR458 spreadsheet or myIR income tax return attachment form options. If you choose the spreadsheet option you will be able to save the form as a working paper on your computer. When completed, submit the form by logging into your myIR account and uploading it as part of the electronic income tax return filing process, or by logging into your myIR account and attaching it to a web message with ‘FIF disclosure’ in the subject line. Alternatively, you can complete the myIR income tax return attachment disclosure form online when preparing your income tax return electronically in myIR. The IR443, IR447, IR448, IR449 and IR458 forms can be found at www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses- and-organisations/types-of-business-income/foreign-investment-funds-fifs/file-a-foreign-investment-fund-disclosure Click ‘Other ways to do this’ on this web page to access the IR458 spreadsheet form. Income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company A resident is required to disclose an income interest of 10% or more in a foreign company. This obligation to disclose applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. For this purpose, the following interests need to be considered: a. an income interest held directly in a foreign company b. an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company c. an income interest held by an associated person (not being a CFC) as defined by subpart YB of the ITA. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more for CFCs, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the ITA should be applied. To determine whether a resident has an income interest of 10% or more in any entity that is not a CFC, for the purposes of this exemption, sections EX 14 to EX 17 should be applied to the foreign company as if it were a CFC. Format of disclosure The forms for disclosure of all interests in a CFC are: • • IR458 spreadsheet form, or • • myIR income tax return attachment form If you choose the spreadsheet option you will be able to save the form as a working paper on your computer. When completed, submit the form by logging into your myIR account and uploading it as part of the electronic income tax return filing process. Alternatively, you can complete the myIR income tax return attachment disclosure form online when preparing your income tax return electronically in myIR. The IR458 spreadsheet form must be accessed online at www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: ir458). Please note that electronic filing is a mandatory requirement for CFC disclosure. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 7 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS Overlap of interests It is possible that a resident may be required to disclose an interest in a foreign company which also constitutes an attributing interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an income interest of 10% or greater in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an attributing interest in a FIF. To meet disclosure requirements, only one form of disclosure is required for each interest. If the interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, then the appropriate disclosure for the calculation method, as discussed previously, must be made. In all other cases, where the interest in a foreign company is not an attributing interest in a FIF, the IR458 spreadsheet form or myIR income tax return attachment form for CFCs must be filed. Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents Interests held by non-residents and transitional residents in foreign companies and FIFs do not need to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs; or to a transitional resident with interests in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF. Under the international tax rules, non-residents and transitional residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under either the CFC or FIF rules. Therefore disclosure of non-residents' or transitional residents' holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules and so an exemption is made for this group. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as "International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR31". 1. Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). It details interests in foreign companies and attributing interests in foreign investment funds (“FIFs”) in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirements in section 61 of the TAA to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ended 31 March 2020. 2. Interpretation For the purpose of this disclosure exemption: • • to determine an income interest of 10% or more, sections EX 14 to EX 17 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) apply for interests in controlled foreign companies (“CFCs”). In the case of attributing interests in FIFs, those sections are to be applied as if the FIF were a CFC, and • • double tax agreement means a double tax agreement in force as at 31 March 2020 in one of the 40 countries or territories as set out in the commentary. The relevant definition of "associated persons" is contained in subpart YB of the ITA. Otherwise, unless the context requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section YA 1 of the ITA. 3. Exemption i. Any person who holds an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company, including interests held by associated persons, that is not an attributing interest in a FIF, or that is an attributing interest in a FIF in respect of which no FIF income or loss arises due to the application of the de minimis exemption in section CQ 5(1)(d) or section DN 6(1)(d) of the ITA, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA for that interest and that income year. ii. Any person who is a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct interest of 10% or more in a foreign company that is not a foreign PIE equivalent, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method for that interest, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, if the person discloses the end-of-year New Zealand dollar market value of investments, in an electronic format prescribed by the Commissioner, split by the jurisdiction in which the attributing interest in a FIF is held or listed. iii. Any person who is not a portfolio investment entity, widely-held company, widely-held superannuation fund or widely-held GIF, who has an attributing interest in a FIF, other than a direct income interest of 10% or more, and uses the fair dividend rate or comparative value calculation method is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year, to the extent that the FIF is incorporated or tax resident in a country or territory with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement in force at 31 March 2020. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 8 LEGISLATION AND DETERMINATIONS iv. Any non-resident person or transitional resident who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an attributing interest in a FIF in the income year corresponding to the tax year ending 31 March 2020, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the TAA in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: ••no attributed CFC income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company under sections CQ 2(1)(d) or DN 2(1)(d) of the ITA; and/or ••no FIF income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that FIF under sections CQ 5(1)(f) or DN 6(1)(f) of the ITA. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the TAA. This exemption is signed on 6 March 2020 Haydn Clark Technical Specialist Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 9 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner's view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS IS 20/01: Income tax – treatment of the receipt of lump sum settlement payments All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. Summary 1. The focus of this statement is setting out how the Commissioner will treat a lump sum payment received under a settlement agreement for claims that (if successful) would have resulted in receipts of both a capital and revenue nature. 2. Whether a settlement payment is taxable depends on what it is paid for – in this case, what was given up in return for the payment – and its nature in the hands of the recipient. It is essential to first determine what a payment is for before determining whether apportionment is necessary. 3. It has been suggested that two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 4. Given this, where a single undissected sum is received, it should be apportioned between its capital and revenue elements where possible. Any apportionment must be made on an objective basis. The starting point for determining an appropriate apportionment will be the settlement agreement and any related documents (for example, the statement of claim (if there is one)). Where necessary, the circumstances surrounding the agreement and other relevant evidence (such as evidence of any negotiations between the parties) should be considered. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer to show the apportionment is appropriate. 5. In the rare circumstance where the payment cannot be appropriately apportioned, the whole amount should be treated the same. Where the lump sum includes an amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. Introduction 6. We have been asked to clarify the Commissioner’s position on how to treat lump sum payments made to settle claims partly capital and partly revenue in nature. There has been uncertainty as to how such payments should be treated. In particular, some people have taken the view that the lump sum should be treated as always wholly capital and, therefore, not subject to income tax. This is based on an interpretation of two High Court of Australia decisions: McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 and Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62. This item sets out the Commissioner’s view on this issue. Analysis How to determine whether an amount is capital or revenue 7. To decide whether a payment is capital or revenue, it is necessary to determine what the payment is for (Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA)). The character of a cause of action discharged by a payment will determine the nature of the payment (Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA)). Therefore, where a payment is received in return for settling claims, it is necessary to consider what the nature of any payment received would have been if those claims had been successful. A payment received to settle claims of a revenue nature would be revenue. A payment received to settle claims of a capital nature would be capital (Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092). This is regardless of the nature of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 10 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS legal rights to make the claims for payment – that is, whether made in contract or tort or under statute or in any other way in which a right to claim may arise (London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll \[1967\] 2 All ER 124 at 134 per Diplock LJ). 8. Sometimes a payment will be made to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. As discussed below, in the Commissioner’s view, generally such payments should be apportioned. An exception to this is where one of the advantages sought is ancillary or incidental to the other. In such a case it may be proper to characterise the payment as wholly capital or wholly revenue (Buckley & Young (at 61,275): Difficulties of characterisation may arise where the director or employee agrees to resign and to give a restrictive covenant. The proper conclusion may be that the payment secures one advantage and the other provision is merely ancillary or incidental, not affecting the character of the payment (cf. Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited v Dale (H.M. Inspector of Taxes) \[1932\] 1 K.B. 124, 139-140). In other cases distinct and separately identifiable advantages may be gained by the payment. There the payment is of a dual character. The statement of the problem highlights the importance of identifying the true character of the payment for which deduction is sought. \[Emphasis added\] In that case, it would not be necessary to go on and consider apportionment. 9. For an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C (and not exempt or excluded income). In the context of settlement payments, common provisions that could apply include s CB 1 (amounts derived from business) and s CE 1 (amounts derived in connection with employment). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “revenue” amounts in this statement assume that a provision in Part C would apply to treat the amount as assessable income. 10. At issue is the tax treatment of a lump sum paid to settle claims of both a capital and revenue nature. Apportionment New Zealand approach 11. The Commissioner considers the approach of the New Zealand courts is to seek to apportion a payment into its capital and revenue elements wherever possible. This is demonstrated in Richardson J’s judgment in Buckley & Young – one of the leading New Zealand cases on apportionment. Although Buckley & Young considered the apportionment of expenditure rather than income, in the Commissioner’s view the same principles are relevant to both. Buckley & Young shows the approach of the New Zealand courts is to apportion where possible, rather than applying an all-or-nothing approach. However, an all-or-nothing approach can arise where the taxpayer fails to provide a reasonable basis for apportionment. 12. Buckley & Young concerned a series of agreements aimed at removing an unsatisfactory employee. The payments made were for both capital (restrictive covenant) and revenue (payment made to remove employee) elements. The contract did not specify how the amounts paid were to be apportioned. 13. Richardson J noted that the purpose of apportionment is to determine how much of an amount the parties have attributed to a particular item. This is done by considering the terms of the contract and, where relevant, the context and background to the agreement. Richardson J took the view that a situation where apportionment was impossible was likely to be rare and the fact an apportionment might be difficult was not, of itself, a reason not to apportion. 14. He also noted that “absolute precision” was not required, nor was it necessary that the apportionment could be “calculated by some kind of scientific process”. Apportionment cannot, however, be based on mere speculation and there must be sufficient evidence to justify the result. Ultimately, apportionment was not possible on the facts of that case as the taxpayer had not put forward any argument as to how apportionment should be made. 15. Case V8 considered the characterisation of a lump sum settlement payment. In that case, the taxpayer (the operator of a kiwifruit packhouse and storage facility) had filed a statement of claim alleging breach of contract by the supplier and manufacturer of an allegedly defective fruit-processing machine, misrepresentation and negligence. The taxpayer claimed compensation of $1,050,561.25. Mediation resulted in an out of court settlement under which the taxpayer received $170,000 from the designer of the machine and $100,000 from the manufacturer. The agreement included a denial of liability by all parties. It was also entered into in “full and final settlement of all issues between the parties in or in connection with” the proceedings. 16. Judge Barber considered that in determining the character of the settlement payment it was necessary to consider the statement of claim, the mediation agreement, the settlement agreement and the circumstances surrounding the case. As the mediation agreement referred to the attached settlement agreement and the statement of claim, these documents were intended to be read together. Judge Barber considered that the settlement payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for the losses specified in the statement of claim. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 11 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 17. The taxpayer argued that, because the payment was received as a lump sum, it could not be apportioned between the ingredients of the original claim made by the taxpayer. Judge Barber held that, as the payment was made to compensate the taxpayer for loss of profits and for repair costs as per the statement of claim, the settlement payment was income, being compensation for revenue losses. The judgment suggests that if it had been established that the settlement payment was compensation for losses of both a capital and revenue nature, apportionment would have been required. Unlike in Allsop (considered in more detail below), the fact that the agreement included a general clause settling all issues between the parties was not seen as relevant – even though there may have been capital claims that the taxpayer could have (but did not) bring. Foregoing the right to sue was an incident of settlement; it did not characterise the payment. 18. Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 related to personal grievance proceedings against an employer. The settlement agreement had been lost so the Taxation Review Authority had to consider whether (and how) a lump sum settlement payment should be apportioned (between revenue amounts (for loss of income) and capital amounts (for humiliation, loss of dignity and hurt feelings)). The taxpayer argued that the entire settlement payment was compensation for injury to feelings. 19. Judge Barber considered all of the available evidence and circumstances and chose to apportion the payments on a pro rata basis of the amounts claimed in the original proceedings. In his view, this was a fair apportionment (at 7,608): I consider that the non taxable element of the settlements needs to be now fixed by this Authority because it has heard the available evidence, and regardless of what limit may have been imposed by the Settlement Agreement. The issue must be what, in commercial and personal reality, was a fair apportionment of each settlement to compensation for feelings injury. \[Emphasis added\] 20. Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 involved an employment court award for wrongful dismissal. The Employment Court awarded Mr Sayer compensation including $62,142 as compensation for lost remuneration, $50,000 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings and $5,000 for costs (a total of $117,142). Mr Sayer applied to wind up the company and also took action against the directors and shareholders of the company for any shortfall that he might suffer as a result of the company’s liability to him, as well as interest and exemplary damages. 21. Mr Sayer entered into a deed of settlement and assignment with the directors and shareholders of the company. At that time, the company owed Mr Sayer $130,944.30. Under the deed of settlement, in consideration of the amount of $100,000, Mr Sayer agreed to assign to a second company all claims that he might have against the company and to release the directors and shareholders from any claims that he had against them. The deed provided that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration for the assignment of Mr Sayer’s claim against the company. 22. The Commissioner had assessed $50,000 as monetary remuneration and had attributed the other $50,000 to compensation for humiliation (capital). Mr Sayer argued that no part of the $100,000 was monetary remuneration as it was paid to bring about the discontinuance of his proceedings against the directors and shareholders (rather than to settle his dispute with the company). However, Doogue J considered that the deed of settlement made it clear that $99,999 of the settlement amount (together with interest less withholding tax) was attributable to the consideration paid for the assignment of the claim against the company and that it was not possible to go behind the deed. 23. The taxpayer also argued that the $100,000 could not be apportioned and must be considered as a whole. This was on the basis of McLaurin and Allsop (which are considered below). Doogue J rejected the taxpayer’s argument on the basis that it was not supported by the facts and distinguished McLaurin and Allsop on the basis that the settlement agreement in Sayer involved settling a claim for liquidated damages (which was squarely within one of the exceptions noted in McLaurin). 24. In Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 the majority of the Court of Appeal (Richardson J and Hardie Boys J) held that payments received under a contract for services were partly capital in character as the payments were received in return for both acting services (income) and for the restraint of trade (capital). The majority also held the payments could be apportioned. 25. In determining an appropriate apportionment, Richardson J was willing to take into account the TRA’s finding as to what level of fee would have been commercial in the circumstances (ie attributing a value to that element of the contract). This, in conjunction with implications from the contract, provided the basis for Richardson J’s conclusion that the TRA’s apportionment was appropriate. 26. On the other hand, Hardie Boys J appears to have been trying to work out from the contract how much the parties intended to allocate to each element (which he found in clause 11 of their contract). In the absence of any indication to this effect, Hardie Boys J suggested that apportionment may have been impossible. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 12 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Conclusion on New Zealand approach 27. The New Zealand courts have tended to take a broad approach to apportionment. The default position is that the courts will apportion where there is a reasonable basis for doing so. In determining an appropriate apportionment, the courts have looked at the documentation between the parties, as well as the relevant context and background. United Kingdom case law 28. Two United Kingdom cases directly on point are Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL) and Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA). Both cases considered the apportionment of undissected lump sum settlement payments. 29. Wales v Tilley was a decision of the House of Lords (which was followed by the House of Lords more recently in Mairs (Inspector of Taxes) v Haughey \[1993\] 3 All ER 801). It concerned the managing director of a company. The company had agreed to pay Mr Tilley a salary of £6,000 a year and had also agreed to pay him a pension of £4,000 a year for 10 years after he ceased to be managing director. Mr Tilley agreed to release the company from the obligation to pay the pension and agreed to a reduced salary of £2,000 a year in consideration for a lump sum payment of £40,000 in two equal instalments. 30. The House of Lords held that, to the extent the payment was received for surrendering a right to a pension, it was capital and, to the extent the payment was made in consideration of a reduction of salary, it was income. There was nothing in the agreement that apportioned the amount between the two rights that had been surrendered. Nor was there any other evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. 31. Viscount Simon noted that if the court considered tax was due under one head but not the other, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Crown, had accepted the amount should be treated as apportionable. On the same point, Lord Thankerton commented that, on the issue of practicability, Mr Tilley’s accountants had provided a basis for apportionment. Lord Porter considered that although there were difficulties in determining the amount attributable to each component (which depended, for example, on when Mr Tilley’s employment ceased), it was not impossible to do so (at 285): It only remains, therefore, to see whether the sum attributable to the release of the pension can be separated from that payable for the reduction of salary. It was only faintly argued on behalf of the Crown that such a division was not possible; but it was said that there were no materials upon which such a calculation could be made inasmuch as the cessation of the salary and the commencement of the pension were dependent on many unascertainable matters, amongst others on the Appellant’s choice of the time of his retirement. No doubt there are difficulties but the resultant figure seems no more incalculable than, say, the length of time during which an injured workman would have continued to earn wages had he not received his injury, a period difficult no doubt to ascertain, but one which has constantly to be estimated in dealing with cases of personal injury. \[Emphasis added\] 32. Therefore, in considering whether an apportionment was possible, Lord Porter considered whether it was possible to objectively calculate the respective values of the rights given up in return for the lump sum payment. The fact the respective amounts would have to be estimated (as they could not be calculated exactly) did not mean apportionment was not possible. The case was referred back to the Special Commissioners to determine the appropriate apportionment. 33. A similar issue was considered by the UK Court of Appeal in Carter v Wadman. In that case, the taxpayer (Mr Carter) was employed as the resident manager of a public house for a salary of £10 per week plus a quarter share of the net profits of the business. The term of the agreement began on 30 January 1942 and ended on 24 June 1949. In 1942 the employer (Mrs Pierce) wished to assign the lease and the licence for the premises and to sell the goodwill, chattels and stock relating to the premises. Mr Carter’s consent to the assignment was required as it was a term of Mr Carter’s agreement with Mrs Pierce that she could not, without his consent, sublet or part with possession of any part of the premises or the goodwill or assets of the business, except in the ordinary course of business. 34. Mr Carter and Mrs Pierce entered into an agreement under which Mrs Pierce agreed to pay Mr Carter £2,000 in consideration of his agreeing to the transfer of the licence to the purchaser and in full settlement of “all past, present and future claims” he might have against her under the management contract. At the time the agreement was made Mr Carter had been paid his salary up to the cancellation date (2 December 1942), but his share of the profits for the 1942 year had not been calculated. In view of the agreement, Mr Carter could no longer make any claim against Mrs Pierce for a share of the profits. Subsequently, it was determined that Mr Carter’s share of the profits would have been £1,090. 35. The Court of Appeal had to determine whether any part of the £2,000 was employment income. It considered the payment was, in part, the price for the cancellation of the agreement and, in part, paid in settlement of past and present claims. One of the possible claims was for the taxpayer’s share of the profits up to 2 December 1942 (this would be employment income). The court considered it was possible to determine the value of the unexpired term of the agreement, at 52-53: Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 13 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Mr. Mustoe sought to argue that, as the consideration was one lump sum of £2,000, it was impossible to point to any portion of the £2,000 and say that it was a profit arising from his employment: but the Crown might equally well have argued that, as it was impossible to fix any sum which represented a capital payment, the whole must be income. ... But we respectfully agree with their Lordships \[in Wales v Tilley\] that in principle there must be apportionment, and we think that on the facts of the present case, though the calculation of the value to the Appellant of the unexpired portion of the agreement must be a matter of estimate, there is no insuperable difficulty in estimating its value. \[Emphasis added\] 36. It can be seen from this that the court was concerned with apportioning the lump sum based on the values of the respective elements. Consistent with Wales v Tilley, there was no consideration given to trying to determine any agreement between the parties as to how the amount was made up. This emphasis on valuation is consistent with the order the court gave regarding apportionment when referring the case back to the General Commissioners. 37. The court found apportionment should be made on the basis of the proportion the sum of £1,090 (the share of the profits to which the taxpayer would have been entitled) bore to the aggregate of £1,090 and the sum the taxpayer would have been entitled to recover from Mrs Pierce as damages for breach of the employment contract, if he had been paid his salary and a share of profits up to cancellation date and had then repudiated the contract. Australian case law 38. The leading Australian cases on this issue are the High Court of Australia decisions in McLaurin and Allsop. The taxpayer in McLaurin had made claims for a total amount of £30,240 as compensation for damage to property as a result of a fire that had spread from a property owned by the Commissioner of Railways. Some of the claims were for amounts that were capital in nature and some for amounts that were revenue in nature. The Commissioner of Railways made a settlement offer of £12,350 and the taxpayer accepted it “in full settlement of all claims for damage arising out of ” the fire. 39. The £12,350 lump sum offer was based on a valuation of the items of property for which the claims had been made, as carried out by a valuer employed by the Commissioner of Railways. There had been various discussions between the valuer and the taxpayer in the course of the valuer arriving at his valuation. However, the court found no information was given to the taxpayer as to how the amount was arrived at. 40. The Commissioner considered £11,000 of the compensation was income, being compensation for the revenue items claimed, determined on the basis of the valuation. The court accepted the valuation was based on a list of items supplied by the taxpayer and the taxpayer could make a confident guess as to the amount allowed by the valuer for each item claimed. However, the court considered the character of the payment in the hands of the recipient could not be determined by the payer’s (the Commissioner of Railways) uncommunicated reasons for agreeing to pay the amount. The court considered the offer made and accepted was for a single undissected amount (not payments for each individual item claimed). 41. The court accepted that it may be appropriate to apportion a single payment of a mixed nature made in settlement of specific claims where at least some of the claims are for liquidated amounts or are amounts that are “otherwise ascertainable by calculation”. In this context, the court referred to Carter v Wadman and Wales v Tilley. It gave Carter v Wadman as an example of a case that included liquidated claims and Wales v Tilley as an example of a case where some of the distinct claims were ascertainable by calculation. 42. However, the court considered apportionment was not appropriate where a payment is made only for claims for unliquidated damages under a compromise that treats the payment as a single undissected payment. In such circumstances, the amount must be considered as a whole. The court considered the damage caused by the fire (whether included in the taxpayer’s claim or not) was compensated for by one entire sum. There was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument that the settlement payment was income on the basis it had the same character as the profits the taxpayer would otherwise have derived. The court, therefore, held the entire sum was capital in nature. 43. The court was concerned with establishing what the parties had agreed the amount was paid for. It was not relevant what one party had originally claimed was payable. It was also not relevant what the other party was willing to pay for (ie the uncommunicated reasons of the payer for making the payment were not relevant). Further, there was no discussion of the possibility of valuing the respective claims given up and apportioning on that basis. This may be because the parties had not argued the case on this basis. 44. Allsop concerned a taxpayer who was in the transport business. The taxpayer had paid the Commissioner for Motor Transport permit fees totalling £54,868 and had been allowed deductions for the permit fees. Following a decision by the Privy Council that the fees were not legally payable, the taxpayer sought recovery of the fees paid on the basis that the amounts had been improperly demanded under the colour of office. A settlement was negotiated under which the taxpayer was paid £37,500. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 14 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 45. The settlement deed was made without any admission of liability on the part of the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport. The deed provided that, in consideration of the payment, the taxpayer released the Government and the Commissioner for Motor Transport from all actions, suits, proceedings, causes of action, arbitrations, debts, dues, demands, costs, charges and expenses the taxpayer had in connection with or arising out of anything done or omitted to be done under the relevant legislation. 46. The High Court of Australia rejected the Commissioner’s argument that, as the payment was a refund of expenditure for which a deduction had been allowed, the amount was income. The court considered there was no factual basis for the Commissioner’s argument. 47. Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the taxpayer would have had valid claims against the Commissioner for unlawful interference with the taxpayer’s vehicles and his business (even though no such claims had been made by the taxpayer). As the settlement deed provided the amount was paid for the release of all potential claims, Barwick CJ and Taylor J considered the entire payment was made by way of compromise of all claims the taxpayer had. No part of the payment was attributable solely to the refund of the fees paid. 48. Windeyer J held the consideration for the payment was the release of a variety of claims the taxpayer had or might be thought to have had against the Government. No part of the payment was received as a refund of permit fees paid by the taxpayer. In particular, Windeyer J appears to have been seeking evidence as to how the parties had calculated the amount before he would have been willing to apportion (at 65): It does not appear from the material before us that the sum of £37,000, or any definite part of it, was computed, paid and received as a refund of particular amounts that had been paid by the appellant for road charges and which had been allowed as deductions in the assessment of his taxable income. 49. The court did not consider attempting to value the respective claims given up. Rather the court seems to have been looking for evidence as to how the parties calculated the amount (ie what they agreed the amount was paid for). As the agreement contained (and, in that case, was limited to) a general release clause covering all potential claims, it was not possible to determine that any specific amount was paid for any specific claim. The court, therefore, found the whole amount should be treated as capital. 50. McLaurin and Allsop have also been followed in later Australian decisions. In determining whether apportionment is possible, the courts have sought evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the amount was calculated. See, for example, FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) at 4128: After negotiation, an entire sum of $200,000 was accepted. Its payment was the subject of agreement, but there was no agreement as to the way in which it was made up. The evidence as to the way the settlement was seen, from one side or another is scant. \[Emphasis added\] 51. The Court held that the entire amount was capital as the payment was received as a lump sum, the ingredients of which were not identified, so there was no basis for apportionment. Conclusion on apportionment 52. In the Commissioner’s view, the Australian and UK courts have taken different approaches to apportioning lump sum settlement payments. The courts in Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman were willing to accept apportionments based on objectively estimated values for different elements of the agreements. On the other hand, the High Court of Australia in McLaurin and Allsop seemed concerned with trying to find evidence of agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. In the absence of this, the courts found that no apportionment was possible. 53. Although McLaurin distinguished Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman, this, arguably, does not fully explain the different approaches to apportionment. The fact the agreement in Carter v Wadman included a liquidated amount did not appear to assist the court with determining any agreement between the parties. It was not a case where the court concluded an amount equal to the amount of the liquidated damages (in that case £1,090) was allocated to that head. In such a situation, it would be easier to argue that the parties had implicitly agreed on the amount to be allocated. However, the court found the £2,000 was paid as a lump sum to cover all of the rights given up. It found that £2,000 had to be apportioned according to the respective values of the different claims. In this regard, the fact there was an amount of liquidated damages was of no more assistance to the court than any other right that could be valued. 54. Similarly, the amounts making up the lump sum in Wales v Tilley do not seem to be any more easily “ascertainable by calculation” than the amounts in McLaurin or Allsop. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 15 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS 55. Neither McLaurin and Allsop nor Wales v Tilley and Carter v Wadman have been applied in New Zealand. The court in Sayer did suggest that, if the facts had been different, the taxpayer would have been able to argue that McLaurin and Allsop applied – however, this does not mean that such an argument would necessarily have been accepted. Rather, in the Commissioner’s view, the broad approach taken in New Zealand apportionment cases is more consistent with the UK approach than the Australian one. It has been suggested that McLaurin and Allsop are authority for the proposition that, if an undissected settlement payment includes both capital and revenue amounts, the whole amount will be treated as capital. To the extent that McLaurin and Allsop stand for this proposition, the Commissioner’s view is that they would not be followed in New Zealand. Rather, where possible, New Zealand courts would seek a reasonable basis for apportioning a lump sum. 56. It is noted that McLaurin and Allsop have also been judicially criticised by the High Court of Australia (see FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001). In that case, the Commissioner was seeking leave to appeal to the High Court. He argued that McLaurin and Allsop should be overturned despite their longevity. Ultimately, although critical of McLaurin and Allsop, the High Court denied the application for leave to appeal. This was because the cases had stood for (at that time) 40 years and Parliament had not chosen to overturn them by legislation. This was despite a recommendation by the Asprey Committee in 1975 that specific legislation be introduced to apportion on a valuation basis. As McLaurin and Allsop have never been applied in New Zealand, the High Court’s reasons for not considering overturning McLaurin and Allsop are not relevant. However, their criticisms are equally valid in New Zealand as in Australia. How should an appropriate apportionment be determined? 57. Any apportionment must be undertaken on an objective basis. The ultimate aim of apportionment is to determine what the amount was paid for and to split it into its capital and revenue parts. As well as considering any settlement agreement, it is likely to be necessary to look at the surrounding circumstances and other, related documentation. 58. Where it can be established that the parties to the settlement have agreed how the payment is made up, this will generally be an appropriate basis for determining the apportionment between capital and revenue amounts. However, the Commissioner may not accept such an apportionment where taking into account the relevant circumstances, the amount allocated to the capital element is excessive, the agreement is a sham, or the agreement is part of a tax avoidance arrangement (see Case S96 at 7,606). 59. Often there will be no agreement between the parties as to how the lump sum was made up. The nature of settlement agreements is that they represent a compromise between parties with competing interests. For example, an employee may want a higher payment for hurt and humiliation, but their employer may prefer a higher payment for lost wages. Other times, the parties may care only about the total amount of the payment and may not have given any thought as to how it is made up. 60. Where there is no (or insufficient) evidence of how the parties intended the amount to be apportioned, it may be appropriate to calculate (or estimate) the value of the respective claims given up in return for the payment. 61. The terms of any statement of claim should be considered. How helpful a statement of claim is will depend on the particular circumstances. For example, a statement of claim is likely to be highly relevant where there is an express link to it in the settlement agreement (as in Case V8). At the other end of the spectrum, if the dispute was settled on a different basis to the statement of claim, it may be of little or no relevance in determining an appropriate apportionment (see du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD)). In situations in between, it is likely to be of some assistance along with evidence of later negotiations between the parties. 62. Evidence of negotiations between the parties prior to settlement and other background facts may also be relevant if they help determine what the payment was made for. 63. The relevance of a general clause releasing a party from all liability will be similarly fact dependent. In some circumstances, it will be included as an incidental element of a settlement agreement (as in Case V8 and Sayer). In other cases, it may be intended to cover one or more claims (as in Carter v Wadman). This will generally be a question of characterisation, rather than apportionment. As discussed above, it is essential to work out what the payment is for before considering apportionment. In Allsop the agreement consisted entirely of a general release clause. In the Commissioner’s view, no apportionment would be required on the facts of Allsop as the full payment was made to settle a claim by the taxpayer of a revenue nature. 64. All relevant factors need to be considered when determining a reasonable basis for apportionment. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 16 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS Amounts that cannot be apportioned 65. In the Commissioner’s view, it will be possible to find an appropriate basis for apportionment in most situations. The taxpayer has the burden of proving that any apportionment is reasonable. Where a taxpayer does not make an apportionment, the Commissioner may, depending on the relevant facts and the information available, make an apportionment that the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. 66. There may be rare situations where no apportionment is possible. In these cases, the whole amount received should be treated the same. As noted above, for an amount to be taxable, it must be “income” under a provision in Part C. Where no part of the amount comes within a provision in Part C, none of the amount will be taxable. 67. However, where the lump sum includes an amount that is taxable under a provision in Part C, the taxpayer has the burden of proving what part of the amount is not taxable. If a taxpayer is unable to show what part of a lump sum payment is capital, the Commissioner’s view is that generally the whole amount should be treated as income. This is consistent with Buckley & Young (at 61,283): If there is insufficient evidence to arrive at a conclusion, any answer must be mere speculation and the taxpayer will have failed to discharge the onus of proof upon him ... 68. This is also consistent with the Commissioner’s position as set out in the Commentary to BR Pub 05/12 Taxability of payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings: Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is settled by the Human Rights Commissioner under the Human Rights Act. The onus of proof regarding the taxability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. \[Emphasis added\] References Related rulings/statements “BR Pub 05/12: Taxability of payments under the Human Rights Act 1993 for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 6 (August 2005): 4 “IS 16/04: Income tax – treatment of the receipt of lump sum settlement payments” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 12 (December 2016): 33 Subject references Income Tax Lump sum Settlement payment Case references Allsop v FCT (1965) 14 ATD 62 (HCA) Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) Carter v Wadman (1946) 28 TC 41 (UKCA) Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 Case V8 (2001) 20 NZTC 10,092 du Cros v Ryall (1935) 19 TC 444 (KBD) FCT v CSR Ltd No S278 of 2000, 23 November 2001 Federal Coke Pty Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 (FCA) Henwood v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271 (CA) McLaurin v FCT (1961) 12 ATD 273 (HCA) FCT v Spedley Securities Ltd 88 ATC 4126 (FCA) Wales v Tilley \[1943\] 1 All ER 280 (HL) Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 17 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS SPS 20/02: Loss offset elections between group companies Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out certain practices that the Commissioner will accept for offsetting losses by election between group companies. It also sets out the consequences of specific events that can impact on a loss offset and how these should be addressed. The Statement does not consider all questions relating to loss offsets within a group of companies and accordingly is not a fully comprehensive guide to Subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007. All legislative references in this Statement refer to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise specified. Application This Statement applies from 12 February 2020 and replaces SPS 17/03 Loss offset elections between group companies published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 1 (February 2018). Standard practice Summary 1. The purpose of the loss offset provisions is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. This means that there is similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. 2. This Statement sets out the application of certain pre-requisites and other aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part-year losses and explains what should happen when the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election and/or subvention payment. 3. A loss company must be resident in New Zealand in terms of s IC 7. The loss company must have maintained a 49% continuity of ownership from the time of the loss to the time of the offset. The profit company(ies) and the loss company must have at least 66% common ownership. The amount of loss offset(s) will be limited to the amount of profit(s) in the profit company(ies). The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the electing company but need not be quantified in the election. Refer to \[13\] to \[15\] for more detail in this area. 4. The loss company must notify the Commissioner of an election for the loss offset and where applicable of a subvention payment within the timeframe under s IC 9. The election may be notified in a tax return or separately from the tax return. The Commissioner may agree to an extension of time for filing the election so long as the request for an extension of time is made and approved before an offset is made. Detailed discussion 5. Subpart IC provides for the sharing of losses between companies that are in the same group of companies. A company may make its tax loss available for subtraction from the net income of another group company. 6. There are two methods of sharing losses which may be used together. The first is for the loss company to notify an election in its tax return for the loss to be made available to the profit company. Any such election is irrevocable. That election must be notified to the Commissioner no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: s IC 9(2). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 18 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 7. Another method of sharing a loss is for the profit company to make a “subvention payment” to the loss company. A subvention payment made to the loss company is offset against the profit company’s net income and reduces the loss company’s available net losses. The payment to the loss company and notice to the Commissioner by the loss company of that payment must be made no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: ss IC 9(1) and (2). 8. Previously the Commissioner took the view that a subvention payment required actual payment to be made. However, from December 2010 it is accepted that in the absence of any statutory definition of “payment” in the context of subvention payments, the following principles will apply: a) The ordinary meaning requires a discharge of obligations between parties. b) There are several ways in which an obligation may be discharged including payment in cash or its equivalent or by certain accounting entries. c) Payment may be made by accounting entries where they cause a genuine crediting in the payee’s account or set off a pre-existing obligation. Making a journal entry will not be generally sufficient to cause a “payment” unless there is a clear agreement between the parties that this will satisfy the obligation. Consequently, in the subvention payment context, “payment” will be satisfied when the obligation under the subvention payment agreement has been discharged. The obligation can be discharged by an actual cash payment, cheque or bank transfer. Other methods of discharging an obligation can also amount to “payment”. An obligation will generally be discharged where the payee can no longer sue the payer for the payment. It should be noted that an accounting entry that merely records an intention to pay a subvention payment will not in itself amount to a “payment”. Also, simply resolving to pay a subvention payment does not amount to creating an enforceable obligation. Example 1 A loss company has an obligation to pay a debt to a profit company for past purchases from the profit company. The profit company resolves to make a subvention payment to the loss company. The profit company and the loss company decide to allow the subvention payment to be applied in satisfaction of the loss company’s past debt. An accounting entry is made to record this. The accounting entry is treated as the payment of the subvention payment. 9. As stated above, this Statement sets out the application of certain aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part year losses, and explains what should happen when the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election. Where this statement discusses elections, it is equally referring to notices of subvention payments made. 10. The election may be included in the loss company’s income tax return or made separately from the tax return. An election must be made by the latest time to file a loss company’s income tax return. The Commissioner has discretion to accept a late election to offset losses beyond an agreed extension of time to file the return. 11. The Commissioner must approve the application to apply the discretion and agree to make the loss offset. The mere processing of the return and issuing the taxpayer’s notice of assessment do not amount to an exercise of the discretion by the Commissioner to accept a late loss offset election. Prerequisites 12. Before a loss offset can proceed the following factors must be present. Loss company 13. There must be a company with a tax loss for an income year or a loss balance carried forward. The loss company must have 49% continuity of ownership from the time the loss is incurred until the loss is offset: ss IA 5(2), (3) and (6). 14. The loss company for the commonality period under s IC 6(1) must be incorporated in New Zealand or be carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 15. The loss company for the commonality period under s IC 6(1) must not be a dual resident company, that is, though resident in New Zealand it must not be: • • treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the double tax agreement, or • • liable to income tax in another country by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation: s IC 7. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 19 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 16. A qualifying company may only receive a loss offset from another qualifying company: s HA 22. Profit company 17. There must be one or more profit companies in the same group of companies as the loss company and all companies must be in the same group of companies for the whole continuity period as defined in s IA 5(6). A group of companies must have at least 66% common ownership. Whether or not two companies form a group of companies is outside the scope of this Statement. More detailed guidance on common ownership can be found in the Interpretation Statement: IS 13/02 Income tax – whether certain rights conferred by the Companies Act 1993 could give rise to a “shareholder decision-making right”. 1 Amount of loss 18. The amount of loss to be offset must not exceed the net income of the elected profit company for the tax year, or the total net income of all the elected profit companies. Nor can the amount of subvention payment that the profit company agrees to pay the loss company exceed the loss company’s tax loss: s IC 8. A specific amount 19. An election should refer to an amount that is capable of identification as a specific dollar amount. The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the loss company but need not be quantified in the notice of election. That is, a formula may be used where the result of applying that formula could be known at the time of the election. For instance, the election might provide that the tax loss to be offset is to be such an amount that would reduce the profit company’s net income to nil. Example 2 In a group consisting of two companies, it is found, once its accounts have been prepared, that Company A has a tax loss of $10,000. It is anticipated that Company B will be in profit and that the amount of the net income will be about $2,000, ie less than the amount of Company A’s tax loss. However, Company B’s accounts have still to be prepared as the accountants are waiting on further information from their clients. That information will be arriving in a few days. There is still time to file an election and the question is whether Company A can now elect to offset some of its loss up to the amount of the profit company’s net income by using a formula. This is permissible because: • • the Commissioner will be notified in time; • • the amount will be subsequently identified as a specific dollar amount; • • it does not matter that (even if the accounting firm could commit staff to the finalisation of the accounts) the net income cannot be ascertained with finality at the time of making the election; • • the amount to be offset is already fixed in that it is controlled by the formula. The election 20. An election to offset the tax loss must be notified by the loss company. The loss company can give notice of election by: • • completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s income tax return, or • • completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s e-filed income tax return, or • • sending a separate notice to the Commissioner. These notices need to set out the names and IRD numbers of the relevant companies as well as the respective amounts (or formula for calculation of the amounts) of net loss to be offset. Late elections and extensions of time for filing them 21. An election must generally be made by 31 March in the year following the year of loss offset (that is, in the year to March 31 when the offset is elected). However, the Commissioner can agree to a later date for the election: s IC 9(2). The notification of the election may be made in the return, or by separate notice. Note that in the case of a subvention payment, the payment must also be made within the same time for notifying the Commissioner of the election: s IC 9(1). 22. In considering an application to apply this discretion, the Commissioner will be mindful of the purpose of the loss offset regime which is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. There should be similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. A case need not be exceptional for the discretion to be exercised favourably. The Commissioner will generally extend the timeframe required to make loss offset 1 This statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: “IS 13/02”). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 20 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS elections where a loss offset would be allowed. However, where the loss company has already taken a tax position that does not provide for a loss offset of a (current year) net loss, an amendment to that tax position will be required to apply any subsequent loss offset election. It is logical that the same rationale that relates to an amendment under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) - where this involves a change to a (current year) net loss - should be applied to the discretion to extend the date for making an election. This means that where an amendment to an assessment under s 113 (TAA) would be denied, the Commissioner would not extend the timeframe for notifying a late loss offset election. 23. To summarise this aspect, the decision to exercise the discretion to notify the late loss offset election will be based on whether the loss offset will be allowed. If the loss offset will be allowed, then the discretion will be exercised. Where the loss company is seeking to amend a position already taken with regard to the loss offset, the discretion will only be exercised where the approval under s 113 (TAA) would be applied. 24. Where the late election relates to the loss company’s available tax losses other than a current year net loss (losses brought forward), then the same rationale that applies to amendments under section 113 (TAA) will equally apply to deciding whether the late election will be allowed. This rationale is set out in SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments 2 . Example 2 A request to extend the date for making a loss offset election is filed on 10 April after 31 March of the year following the year of loss offset. The reason given for requesting the extension is that although the loss company’s income tax return had been prepared and filed sometime previously there were numerous profit companies in the group and the preparation of those returns had taken time. Consequently, the income tax returns for the profit companies had been filed late. At the time of filing its return, the loss company was unaware of the group company’s profit outcome. The loss company made no loss offset election within the time for the loss company to file their income tax return. Section 113 (TAA) would be applied to allow a loss offset. The reason is that the loss company was not aware of the full facts and erred when it took its tax position (refer para \[59\] of SPS 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments). Further elections 25. Once a loss company has made an election, it cannot withdraw that election or change any part of that election. It is final and irrevocable: s IC 5(4). However, further elections can be made in some cases, for instance a loss company is not limited to a single election in respect of only one profit company. As already noted, it must be remembered that any further elections would be treated as a request to amend an assessment under s 113 (TAA). Part-year losses 26. It is possible to offset a part-year loss (s IP 4) provided the following requirements as set out in s IP 4(2) are met: • • the tax loss component arises in the common span (as defined in s IP 2(1)), and • • the amount of the tax loss component is no more than the net income that the profit company derives in the common span, and • • continuity of ownership in the loss company under s IC 2(1) applies from the beginning to the end of the common span, and • • the loss company and the profit company provide the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under s IP 6. These accounts should contain sufficient information to indicate the calculation of the amount of the company’s net income for the relevant part of the corresponding income year. The Commissioner’s view is that the financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting practice, adjusted for the purposes of income tax legislation, at the level required under the Financial Reporting Act 2013 and the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. This does not require the preparation of notes to the accounts and disclosure statements. The part-year accounts will of necessity be different from full year accounts due to different ratios, denominators etc, and • • a valid loss offset election (s IP 7) within the timeframes required for elections under s IC 9. –As stated above, loss offsets are limited to the profit company’s profit for the year (s IC 8 refers). 27. Where a company has a break in shareholder continuity part way through a month and its accounting system balances and reports at the end of the month, subject to the taxpayer backing out significant transactions pre or post the change in continuity, the Commissioner will accept the use of the end-of-month balance sheet figures for determining provision balances. She will also accept pro-rata allocation of the month’s income and expenditure to determine the pre and post continuity change in net income or loss. 2 This statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: SPS 16/01). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 21 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS 28. In some cases it may be difficult to prepare part-year accounts to the level of detail set out above, particularly where there has been a significant lapse of time since the loss of shareholder continuity for the part-year. In such circumstances, taxpayers may discuss their individual positions with the Commissioner and depending on the facts a different approach may be agreed upon. Amended assessments 29. In some cases, the Commissioner may amend an assessment for a profit or loss company resulting in increased or reduced net income or losses respectively. As a consequence there may be a need for further elections for additional loss offsets. There are four situations that may be brought about by amended assessments. These are: • • the available loss is reduced below the amount originally elected to be offset; • • the available loss is increased; • • the profit company has additional net income that could be the subject of an offset: and • • the profit company has reduced net income below the level of the amount of the loss offset. Reduced loss 30. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended (having its loss reduced below the level in the loss offset election) and consequently is not entitled to offset the amount elected then the following action will be taken: (i) where there is only one profit company then the Commissioner will, usually after consultation with the company or its agent, simply amend the assessment for the profit company in accordance with section 113 (TAA). No further election is necessary as the assessment of the profit company will reflect the reduced loss available to be offset, and (ii) where there is more than one profit company the loss company will need to notify the Commissioner as to how that reduced loss is to be allocated to the profit companies pursuant to IC 11(3). If the loss company does not make this subsequent election within 6 months of the loss company being notified that its tax loss is reduced or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow, the reduced loss is allocated proportionately to the original amount of the loss offset allocated to each profit company: s IC 11(4). 31. In the case where the reduction results in a subvention payment being treated as a dividend in the hands of the loss company, the dividend may be reduced to the extent this portion of the subvention payment is repaid to the profit company within the same timeframe discussed in the preceding paragraph: s IC 11(5). Increased loss 32. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended and therefore has additional losses to offset, a further election can be made for those additional losses. The first election remains valid and cannot be revoked. The further election must meet all the criteria set out above for an election, for example it must be on time, state the additional amount to be offset, and name the profit company or companies. As discussed already, any amendment will be subject to the SPS 16/01. Increased profit 33. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and consequently has additional net income that could be the subject of an offset, a further election can be made by the loss company in respect of the additional net income within the statutory time period (set out in s IC 9(2)). This election must meet all the criteria for loss offsets. The emphasis will be on the notification of a loss offset by the loss company. It will not focus on the profit company’s change in net income. Reduced profit 34. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and therefore has reduced net income (below the level of the loss offset), the deduction for the profit company remains valid up to the reduced amount of the net income. The “unused” tax loss will be added back to the loss balance carried forward by the loss company. A further election can be made for the additional losses to other profit companies within the group. Any further election must meet all the relevant criteria for loss off-sets. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 22 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS Requests to amend assessments 35. Changes to the assessments of the loss company or profit company may impact on the loss offset election already made and the availability of further loss offset elections. Examples are discussed in the immediately preceding paragraphs. 36. Requests will be looked at from the amending loss company’s point of view. This means, for example, that the Commissioner will be considering why a loss company made an error with their initial loss offset. In that case, it may not be relevant why the profit companies’ net income was amended. 37. Where there are any consequential impacts on the loss offset election and a further election needs to be made or the election needs to be revised, the taxpayer companies may need to consider whether s 113 (TAA) allows those changes to be implemented. SPS 16/01 sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may amend assessments to ensure correctness, is relevant in considering whether the election should be accepted. 38. It should be noted that taking tax positions that both include or exclude a loss offset are each correct tax positions. The Commissioner will not amend one correct tax position to another correct tax position unless the initial tax position was made in error. The onus will be on the taxpayer to show that this was the case. 39. It is the Commissioner’s practice that having approved a further election so that the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced, those amendments will be made. Generally, the Commissioner will not agree to amend an assessment where the taxpayer has previously had the opportunity to offset known losses, and has failed, for whatever reason, to do so. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 12 February 2020.

Court of Appeal decides forgiveness of debt can be a charitable gift qualifying a taxpayer for donation tax credit Case Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Nancy Lois Roberts \[2019\] NZCA 654 Decision date17 December 2019 Act(s)Income Tax Act 2007, ss LD 1 and LD 3 Interpretation Act 1999, s 5 Keywordsappeal; charitable trust; forgiveness of debt; donation tax credits; charitable or public benefit gift; monetary gift; statutory interpretation Summary This was an appeal of the High Court’s decision that Nancy Lois Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a “charitable or other public benefit gift” within s LD 3(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA) qualifying her for a donation tax credit (Nancy Lois Roberts v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2153). The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision and found that: For the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), the term “monetary” means “of or pertaining to money”; • • In this context, “monetary” is not limited to include only cash, credit cards, cheques and bank transfers as the Commissioner submitted; • • In this context, “monetary” also includes a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities; and • • Mrs Roberts’ forgiveness of debt was a monetary gift that was paid Impact As a result of this judgment, taxpayers who have made gifts of forgiveness of debt can qualify for donation tax credits. However, on 17 December 2019, the Minister of Revenue issued a media statement proposing an urgent remedial amendment to clarify that debt forgiveness does not qualify for donation tax credits. The proposed amendment would apply retrospectively to 1 April 2008, being the commencement date of the ITA. A savings provision would apply to taxpayers who have already taken a position in reliance on the current legislation and have filed a return or donation tax credit claim before the date of the announcement. The amendment is contained in the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The Bill has passed the Second Reading Stage on 4 March 2020. Inland Revenue will continue to monitor the situation in light of the judgment and the proposed amendment. Facts Mrs Roberts and her late husband jointly established the Oasis Charitable Trust (the Trust) in 2007 and registered it with the Charities Commission. In October 2008, Mr and Mrs Roberts lent $1,708,080.90 to the Trust (the Loan). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 24 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES In each income year ending 2011 to 2015, Mrs Roberts executed Deeds of Gift which released the Trust from liability to repay specified amounts of the Loan. She then claimed a donation tax credit for each of those five years on the basis that the forgiveness of debt was a charitable gift. The donation tax credits totalled $91,577.24, which corresponded with the $274,732 worth of debt that was forgiven. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) issued a notice on 4 May 2016 requiring repayment of the portion of donation tax credits paid to Mrs Roberts relating to the forgiveness of debt. Decision 1. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal, holding that a forgiveness of debt was capable of being a “monetary gift” under s LD 3(1)(a) of the ITA and that Ms Roberts was entitled to the donation tax credits she received. 2. The Court applied s 5(1) of the Interpretation Act 1999, which provides that the text of the statutory provision and its purpose will determine the correct interpretation, noting that even if the meaning of the text appears plain in isolation of purpose, it must be cross-checked against the purpose to satisfy the dual requirements of the Interpretation Act. The words used in the legislation 3. The Court noted the definition of “charitable or other public benefit gift” in s LD 3(1)(a) used the words “a gift of $5 or more that is paid” (for the 2011 to 2013 years), and “a monetary gift of $5 of more that is paid” (for the 2014 to 2015 years). 4. In interpreting the word “monetary”, the Court relied on dictionary definitions and concluded that for the purposes of s LD 3(1)(a), “monetary” is intended to mean “of or pertaining to money”. The Court accepted that the term “monetary” excludes a gift of land, chattel or services. 5. In interpreting the word “money”, the Court also relied on dictionary definitions and in particular, the Laws of New Zealand that defines “money” as follows (Laws of New Zealand Money (online ed) at \[3\] (footnotes omitted). The letters were added by the Court of Appeal for ease of reference): • • \[A\] The term “money” generally includes banknotes as well as coins. However, the amount of money that can be paid in the various small denomination bank notes and in coins is limited. \[B\] The term money is sometimes used to include not only actual cash but also a right to receive cash, such as sums standing to the credit of a bank account, or invested in securities. \[C\] The term may also be used in a popular sense to include all personal or even, exceptionally, all real and personal property. If the term “money” is used in relation to paying money into Court it is to be construed in its ordinary and natural meaning, as including money in foreign currency. 6. The Court was attracted to the wider definition set out in \[B\] in this context as the definition at \[A\] was too narrow and inapt for the general statutory context. The Court (in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Nancy Lois Roberts \[2019\] NZCA 654 (the Commissioner v Roberts) at \[38\]) held that: • • Parliament clearly intended that payment could be achieved by debiting and crediting accounts, thus excluding a meaning of just bank notes or coins. It was common ground that the provision was not confined to money in this narrow sense. 7. Furthermore, the definition at \[C\] was too wide as it would include gifts of services, personal property, goods, chattels and land and it was clear that Parliament did not intend to include such gifts within s LD 3(1)(a). 8. Accordingly, the Court rejected the Commissioner’s assertion that the words “monetary” and “money” were limited only to cash payments and the like, and held that the text of s LD 3(1)(a) is not limited to include only cash, credit cards, cheques and bank transfers. The legislative history and extrinsic aids 9. The Court considered the extensive legislative history of the charitable donations provisions and, in doing so, found it provided no support for the interpretation of “monetary” or “money” contended by the Commissioner. 10. The Court found that there has been, for a number of years, somewhat of a disconnect between the actual wording of the legislation and the commentary or discussion generated by officials (the Commissioner v Roberts) at \[58\]. 11. References in discussion papers and officials’ reports that differed from the statutory language (such as commentary references to “cash donations” differing from the statutory language “money”) were considered by the Court as “imprecise paraphrase\[ing\]” that did not provide any real assistance in interpreting statutory language, at \[58\] – \[62\]. It noted that comments by officials, unless they form part of the Parliamentary record, are not an especially reliable, or orthodox, form of legislative history. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32 No 3 April 2020 Inland Revenue Department 25 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES Policy arguments 12. The Court found that none of the policy arguments the Commissioner advanced to support her interpretation of the statutory language (avoiding significant compliance and administrative costs and the difficulty of valuing non-cash donations which could result in tax avoidance) were compelling or persuasive. 13. The Court agreed with Mrs Roberts that the concerns advanced under the grounds that excluding forgiveness of debt avoids significant compliance and administrative costs were exaggerated. It considered that if Parliament was concerned about this, these concerns could be addressed by more detailed and specific drafting of the statutory provisions. 14. The Court was also unpersuaded by suggestions that greater administration costs will arise with the inclusion of forgiveness of debts. While significant investigation and checking may be required for tax rebate claims in relation to gifts of cash, depending on the circumstances of the giving, the Court found that concerns about tax avoidance were overstated by the Commissioner. It noted that there are now robust statutory mechanisms in place to deal with any instances of tax avoidance in this context, at \[64\] – \[66\].
