[Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Bonus) Amendment Act 2009](/new-legislation/act-articles/student-loan-scheme-repayment-bonus-amendment-act-2009 "Introduction - Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Bonus) Amendment Act 2009")

Detail - Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Bonus) Amendment Act 2009
=================================================================

2009 amendment to the Student Loan Scheme provides a 10% bonus for borrowers who pay $500 or more in excess of their annual compulsory repayment obligation.

**_Sections 45A to 45H of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992_**

The Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Bonus) Amendment Bill was introduced into Parliament on 27 April 2009. The Bill had its first reading on 5 May 2009 and was considered by the Education and Science Committee, which reported the Bill back to the House on 3 August 2009. The Bill completed all remaining parliamentary stages on 17 September 2009 and received Royal assent on 22 September 2009.

The Act amends the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 to provide a 10% bonus for borrowers who pay $500 or more in excess of their annual compulsory repayment obligation.

The bonus will not be of financial benefit to all borrowers. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is unable to provide financial advice. Borrowers may therefore wish to seek independent advice before making excess repayments.

**Background**  
The Act gives effect to a commitment given by the National Party in the lead-up to last year's election to introduce a bonus scheme for borrowers to encourage them to make voluntary repayments so their student loans are repaid more quickly.

**Key features**  
A 10% bonus will be available for those who make excess repayments on their student loans on or after 1 April 2009. The bonus will be available to both New Zealand and overseas-based borrowers. Only repayments made to Inland Revenue will qualify for the bonus.

Excess repayments will be any repayments in respect of a tax year that exceed the borrower's compulsory repayment obligation for that tax year by $500 or more. The excess repayment can be made in a lump sum or by smaller contributions throughout the year.

The loan balance needs to be at least $550 at the beginning of the tax year for excess repayments to attract the bonus. If the loan balance was $550 or more at the start of the tax year, but between $500 and $549 at the time of the final repayment, the maximum bonus will be $49. Borrowers wishing to repay their loan in full will need to pay 10/11ths of their loan balance (provided all obligations are up to date).

Borrowers who are required to make interim instalments during the tax year will have until the third interim instalment date - 7 May after the end of the tax year for most borrowers - to make repayments that will count towards the bonus.

For borrowers fully repaying their loan during the tax year, the bonus will be credited to the loan balance as at the date of the final repayment. Borrowers repaying in full before 31 March 2010 will have the bonus backdated to the date on which the final repayment was made.

For borrowers who do not repay in full, the bonus will be calculated after the end of the tax year and credited to their loan balance as at the following 1 April. This is because it is not until after the end of the tax year that a borrower's compulsory repayment obligation, which is income-contingent for New Zealand-based borrowers, and thus the amount of any excess repayments, can be established with certainty. Borrowers will generally not have to apply for the bonus. (The exception to this is PAYE errors which are discussed below.) After the end of the tax year, or at the time the final repayment is made, Inland Revenue will check borrowers' entitlements and apply the bonus accordingly.

**Examples**

_Janis is a salary and wage earner who has asked her employer to deduct $20 extra from her fortnightly income and pay it to Inland Revenue for repayment of her student loan._ After the end of the tax year, her compulsory repayment obligation is established at $700 and the total deductions from her salary are $1,220. Janis will be entitled to a bonus of $52 ($1,220 \- $700 x 10%) and this will be credited to her loan account on 1 April of the next tax year.

_Martin is a salary and wage earner who has just the standard deductions made from his weekly wages, and these total $2,560 for the year._ When Martin heard about the bonus scheme in June 2009 he set up automatic repayments of $100 a month from his bank account and these repayments total $1,000 by 31 March 2010. Martin's compulsory repayment obligation for the 2009-10 tax year is assessed in May 2010 at $2,550. A bonus of $101 ($2,560 + $1,000 \- $2,550 x 10%) is credited to Martin's loan account as at 1 April 2010.

_Paula is currently at home looking after her children and, as her income is under the repayment threshold, does not have any compulsory repayment obligation._ Her parents decide to give her the money to fully repay her loan. Paula rings Inland Revenue at the end of April 2010 and is told that her loan balance is $11,000 and she will need to repay $10,000 to fully repay her loan. Her parents give her this amount and she pays it to Inland Revenue on 20 May 2010. Inland Revenue calculates her bonus at $1,000, credits it to Paula's loan balance as at 20 May 2010 and advises her that her loan has been fully repaid.

_Dennis is working in the_ _UK on_ _17 July 2010._ He accesses his IR online services and establishes that his loan as at that day, including interest, is $24,453 and that, allowing for the bonus, he needs to pay $22,230. He calculates that this is equivalent to £8,900 and the following day arranges for his bank to transfer this amount to Inland Revenue. However, because of exchange fluctuations, the amount that Inland Revenue receives is actually $22,460. Inland Revenue credits a bonus of $2,223 and refunds $230 to Dennis.

_Brendon is working in_ _Australia on_ _1 September 2010._ He accesses his IR online services and establishes that his loan as at that day, including interest, is $15,972 and that, allowing for the bonus, he needs to pay $14,520. However, Brendon does not actually make the payment until 15 October 2010. By that time his loan has increased to $16,106 because of interest charged since 1 September. To clear the loan balance Brendon would need to pay a further $122.

_Margaret's loan was $2,300 at the start of the 2010-11 tax year._ By 22 November 2010, repayment deductions made from her salary and wages have reduced this to $530. Margaret decides to pay off the loan in full before she heads off overseas and sends Inland Revenue a cheque for $500. Inland Revenue applies this and a bonus of $30 to Margaret's loan balance and advises her that her loan is now fully repaid.

Small inaccuracies may arise in the repayment deductions that are made from salary and wages during the tax year. In addition, employers sometimes make errors in the amount of these deductions. The Commissioner has therefore been given the ability to allow the bonus if the Commissioner considers that the borrower did make a voluntary repayment(s) of $500 or more, but the end-of-year excess was less than this because the shortfall arises under the PAYE system and is:

*   less than $20;
*   due to the borrower starting or ceasing employment; or
*   due to the employer's error.

Inland Revenue has no way of automatically identifying whether one of these events has occurred and it will be necessary for any affected borrower to bring this to Inland Revenue's attention.

**Examples**

_Gary tells his employer that he has a student loan, but his employer overlooks deducting the $165 that should have been deducted for April 2009._ In March 2010, Gary receives a bonus and decides to use $500 of it towards repayment of his student loan, which he pays directly to Inland Revenue. Gary's repayment obligation for the 2009-10 tax year is $2,000 and his repayment deductions for the year are $1,830. His excess repayment is therefore $330 and no bonus is initially allowed. Gary contacts Inland Revenue and points out his employer's error. Inland Revenue checks this out and then allows Gary a bonus of $50.

The bonus will not apply to any excess repayment for which a refund is subsequently requested or to any repayment that needs to be applied to another liability, such as an amount in respect of an earlier tax year.

**Examples**

_Miriam made excess repayments of $3,000 and was credited with a $300 bonus._ However, shortly after receiving notice of this, she decides that she wishes to have $1,000 refunded to cover an unexpected bill. Inland Revenue makes the refund and reduces Miriam's bonus to $200.

_Grant made excess repayments of $2,000 and was credited with a $200 bonus._ He subsequently decides that he would be better off using this money to reduce his mortgage and asks for the full amount to be refunded. Inland Revenue makes the refund and reduces Grant's bonus to zero.

_Brent's repayments for the 2009-10 tax year exceeded his repayment obligation for that year by $650._ However, his terminal repayment obligation for the 2008-09 tax year of $210, which was due on 7 February 2010 has not been paid. After crediting $210 to the 2008-09 tax year, the excess repayment amount is less than $500 and no bonus is allowed.

**Application date**  
The Act comes into force on 1 April 2010, but the bonus will apply to excess repayments made on or after 1 April 2009.

John works 40 hours a week

John normally works 40 hours a week and earns the minimum wage of $23.15 an hour.

$23.15 × 40 hours = $ 926 a week before tax income

$926 ÷ 7 days = $ 132.30 a day

Assuming it’s not a leap year:

$132.30 × 365 = $48,289.50 annual income

(If it’s a leap year then multiply by 366 days)

John gets a bonus during the year of $1,500

$48,289.50 + $1,500 = $49,789.50

John estimates his income for Working for Families payments will be $ 49,789.50

John could round this estimate up to $49,790.

Ross and Kelly have an income increase

Ross is paid $50,000 a year. On 1 December Kelly gets a part-time job working 8 hours a week on the minimum wage of $23.15 per hour. Her employer tells her there will be overtime available. Kelly works out her income estimate based on 10 hours a week to make sure overtime is included.

At the start of the year, Ross and Kelly estimated their family income at $50,000. Now that Kelly has a job they will estimate again.

Kelly's estimated earnings up until 31 March:

$23.15 × 10 hours = $231.50  a week before tax income.

$231.50 ÷ 7 days = $33.07 a day

From 1 December to 31 March is 121 days (if not a leap year, 122 if leap year)

Assuming it is not a leap year:

$33.07 × 121 days = $4,001.47

$50,000 + $4,001.47 = $54,001.47

$54,001.47 is Ross and Kelly's new income estimate. Kelly could round this estimate up to $54,002.

Kelly logs in to myIR and updates her family income details from 1 December.

Amount of a particular schedular payment (being per diem allowances paid in the screen production industry) that shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in production of payment
===================================================================================================================================================================================

This Determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of particular schedular payments when those payments are per diem allowances paid to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working in the Screen Production Industry in New Zealand.

### Introduction

This Determination sets out the amount regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of particular schedular payments when those payments are per diem allowances paid to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working in the Screen Production Industry in New Zealand

Section RA (5) & RD 10 (1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 require anyone who makes a PAYE income payment to deduct tax when making it

Under section RD 3 (1-4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 a schedular payment is included in the definition of "PAYE income payments”. Consequently, any person who makes a schedular payment must deduct tax from it at the time it is made, unless an exemption applies

The Screen Production Industry pays per diem allowances to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers working on screen productions when they are working away from their town of normal residence. These allowances are to cover the costs of food as well as other minor incidental expenses in New Zealand

As per diems paid to resident and non-resident contractors and entertainers come within the definition of PAYE income payments, tax must be deducted from such payments

Section RD 8 (3) allows the Commissioner to determine an amount or proportion of any PAYE income payment that is considered to be expenditure incurred in the production of that payment. If the Commissioner has made such a determination, the person paying the particular schedular payment or class of schedular payments is only required to deduct tax from the amount of the PAYE income payment that exceeds this threshold (section RD 11(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007)

### Application

This Determination applies to payments of per diem allowances made to resident and non-resident contractors and resident and non-resident entertainers in the Screen Production Industry. It applies:

*   to per diem allowance of $80 paid on or after 1st July 2018
*   except where any resident or non-resident contractor, or any resident or non-resident entertainer is also provided with the goods and services for which the allowance is paid by the payer or another party acting on the payer's behalf, and
*   until the Commissioner varies or revokes this determination.

### Interpretation

In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in Schedule 4 \[Standard rates for tax for schedular payments\] and sections RD 8 and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007

### Determination

Where any resident or non-resident contractor, or resident or non-resident entertainer receives a per diem allowance in relation to services provided to a screen production and that allowance is a schedular payment, the sum of $80 per day shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the payment. If the total amount of the payment is less than $80 per day, the total amount of the payment shall be regarded as expenditure incurred in the production of the payment

However, where the resident or non-resident contractor, or resident or non-resident entertainer is also provided with the goods and services for which the allowance is paid, either by the payer or another party acting on the payer's behalf, then no amount will be exempted by operation of this Determination from the application of the Income Tax Act 2007

This Determination is made by me, acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

This Determination is signed on the 1st day of July 2018

### Examples

These examples apply to per diems which come within the definition of "schedular payment" in the Income Tax Act 2007.

##### Example 1

Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $80. The goods and services for which the allowance is paid are not also provided by the payer or another payer acting on the payer’s behalf. The payer does not have to deduct tax because the total payment does not exceed $80 per day. The contractor/entertainer does not have to keep receipts.

##### Example 2

Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $80. Contractor/entertainer is also provided with all meals while working, either on the set, or at some other location. The payer has to deduct tax from the per diem allowance of $80 as one of the matters for which the allowance is being paid is also being actually provided by the payer.

##### Example 3

Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $80. The contractor/entertainer is also able to obtain food from a particular café adjacent to the set. The café is directly reimbursed by the production company. In that situation the cost of the food is met by the payer of the per diem and it is being physically provided on its behalf. The payer has to deduct tax from the per diem allowance of $80.

##### Example 4

Contractor/entertainer receives a per diem allowance of $100. The cost of the goods and services for which the allowance is paid are incurred by the recipient. The payer has to deduct tax from $20 of each daily payment as the payment exceeds the $80 threshold on a daily basis.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Present Value Calculation Methods Issued: 24 October 1990 G10B This Determination may be cited as “Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods”. G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G10A: Present Value Calculation Methods, made by the Commissioner on 23 April 1990. This determination differs from Determination G10A by modifying present value Method A to enable it to apply to perpetuities. 2. For the purposes of the accrual tax accounting regime it may be necessary to calculate present values for a variety of reasons, for example: (a) To calculate the yield to maturity of a financial arrangement. The yield to maturity is the interest rate at which the first amount payable under the financial arrangement is equal to the present value of all subsequent amounts payable under the financial arrangement calculated as at the due date of the first payment: (b) To calculate present values at intermediate times during the term of a financial arrangement in order to calculate the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by a person in respect of the financial arrangement. 3. The present value of a financial arrangement as at a date excludes any amounts payable under the financial arrangement on that date. 4. This determination specifies approved methods of calculating present values for use in other determinations. These methods may be added to or removed from time to time. Method A is a general purpose method suitable for many applications and gives very similar results to Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. Method A may be used on either a 360 or 365 day basis. Method A is applicable both to perpetuities in which all coupons are the same after some period, and to financial arrangements which have a final payment Method B is used to calculate prices of government or local authority stock, and other financial arrangements having similar characteristics, employing the formula approved by the International Association of Bond Dealers and used in calculators such as the HP12C. It differs from Method A in two respects— (a) Coupons must be payable at regular half yearly or quarterly intervals, and (b) Compound interest is used in the first period, unless it is also the last period in which case simple daily interest is used (Method A always uses simple daily interest in the first period). G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Both methods calculate the present value at the beginning of a period by taking the present value at the end of the period, adding or subtracting the net cashflows at the end of the period, and discounting the total at a Specified Discount Rate. 5. Alternative approved methods may not generate exactly identical results. 6. Once a person has elected to use an approved method of calculating the present value of a financial arrangement, that method shall be used by the person over the life of the financial arrangement unless the prior consent of the Commissioner is obtained to adopt another method. 7. This determination is for use in conjunction with other determinations, for example Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(a) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. Determination G10A: Present Value Calculation Methods is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this Determination G10B is signed. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall be used as required by any other determination which will specify— a) The date at which the present value shall be calculated (the “Specified Date”); and b) The interest rate that shall be used in the calculation (the “Specified Discount Rate”); and c) The amounts and due dates for which the present value shall be calculated— and which may specify the method to be used. 4 Principle This determination specifies alternative methods for calculating the present value of a financial arrangement, equal to the sum of the values as at the Specified Date of all amounts payable under the financial arrangement after that date, discounted at the Specified Discount Rate. G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Interpretation 1. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 2. In this determination unless the context otherwise requires— “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Income Year” has the same meaning as in sections 64B to 64M of The Act: “Period” and “Period Between Payments” in relation to a person means a term— (a) Commencing immediately after— (i) A Specified Date in relation to a financial arrangement; or (ii) A date on which an amount is payable under a financial arrangement as the case may be; and (b) Ending on the next succeeding date on which an amount is payable under a financial arrangement. Provided that if a Period or a Period Between Payments exceeds one year it shall be deemed to comprise one or more Periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the person) by a Period of not more than one year: “Specified Date” in relation to a financial arrangement means the date at which the present value of the financial arrangement is required to be calculated: “Specified Discount Rate” in relation to a financial arrangement and a person means the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the financial arrangement is required to be calculated. 3. The number of days in a Period calculated on a 365 day basis is the actual number of days in the Period including the ending date of the Period but excluding the starting date of the Period. The number of days in a Period calculated on a 360 day basis means the number of days falling within the Period including the ending date of the Period but excluding the starting date of the Period and calculated as if every calendar month of the Period had exactly 30 days; Provided that if the ending date is the 31st day of the month and— G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) The starting date of the Period is not the 30th or 31st day of a month, the ending date shall be included in the number of days in the Period; (b) The starting date of the Period is the 30th or 31st day of a month, the ending date shall be deemed to be the 30th day of the month. 4. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used that are not defined in this clause have the same meaning as in sections 2 and 64B to 64M of The Act. 5. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as referring to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6 Method 1. A person shall elect to use a method allowed under a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(a) of The Act for the purpose of calculating a present value in relation to a financial arrangement, and shall apply that method consistently in respect of that financial arrangement, until it matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred by the person unless the prior consent of the Commissioner (which may be given conditionally) to adopt another method is obtained. 2. Method A (a) For the purpose of applying clause 6(2)(b) of this determination, in relation to any person N shall be calculated as follows: (i) Where the greatest common divisor of all Periods Between Payments is— (A) A year or 12 months, N shall be taken as 1; (B) A halfyear or 6 months, N shall be taken as 2; (C) A quarter or 3 months, N shall be taken as 4; (D) A month, N shall be taken as 12; (E) A fortnight, N shall be taken as 26; (F) A week, N shall be taken as 52; Provided that where 1 or 2 of the Periods are shorter or longer than all the other Periods this fact shall be disregarded in determining the greatest common divisor, G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and for the shorter or longer Period or Periods N shall be, at the option of the person, taken as— (G) 365 divided by the number of days in the Period calculated on a 365 day basis; or (H) 360 divided by the number of days in the Period calculated on a 360 day basis. (ii) Where N cannot be determined according to the foregoing subparagraph it shall be, at the option of the person, taken as— (A) 365 divided by the number of days in the Period calculated on a 365 day basis— (B) 360 divided by the number of days in the Period calculated on a 360 day basis— for all of the Periods. (b) The amount of the present value of a financial arrangement calculated according to Method A as at a date shall— (i) Where the given date is a date on which an amount is payable under a financial arrangement, and the same amount is payable at the end of every period following the given date, be calculated according to the following formula: (ii) In any other case, be calculated according to the following formula: where— A is the present value (if any) as at the end of the Period immediately following the given date; and B is the sum of the amounts receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer at the end of the Period immediately following the date; and C is the sum of the amounts payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer at the end of the Period immediately following the given date; and G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] E is the same amount receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer at the end of every Period following the given date; and F is the amount calculated in relation to the financial arrangement and the person and the period immediately following the date according to the following formula: R is the Specified Discount Rate. 3. Method B (a) A person shall apply Method B only to financial arrangements which are debt instruments under which all payments after the issue or acquisition date are at regular halfyearly or quarterly intervals. (b) For purposes of applying clause 6(3)(c) of this determination in relation to any person— (i) If amounts are payable at regular halfyearly intervals, N shall be taken as 2 and the preceding due date shall be taken as the date 6 calendar months prior to the date on which the first amount is payable on or after the date of issue or acquisition; (ii) If amounts are payable at regular quarterly intervals, N shall be taken as 4 and the preceding due date shall be taken as the date 3 calendar months prior to the date on which the first amount is payable on or after the date of issue or acquisition. (c) The amount of the present value of a financial arrangement calculated according to Method B as at a date shall be calculated according to the following formula: where— A is the present value (if any) as at the end of the Period immediately following the date; and B is the sum of the amounts receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer at the end of the Period immediately following the date; and G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] C is the sum of the amounts payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer at the end of the Period immediately following the date; and D is (a) Where an amount is payable at the end of the Period immediately following the date is the last amount payable under the financial arrangement, an amount calculated according to the following formula: (b) In any other case, an amount calculated according to the following formula: F means an amount calculated according to the following formula: R is the Specified Discount Rate; and T1 is the number of days in the Period immediately following the date calculated on a 365 day basis; and T2 is the sum of T1 and— (i) where an amount is payable on the date, zero; or (ii) In any other case, the number of days between the preceding due date and the date calculated on a 365 day basis. 7 Example 1. Example A (a) This example illustrates Method A, using the same example as in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (except for the dates) and Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, Example A. The example shows G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] that the present value at the beginning of a Period is the same as the principal outstanding during the Period. On 12 March 1991 (the Specified Date) a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income— The greatest common divisor of all Periods except the first is 6 months, so that N = 2; in the first (broken) Period ending on 15 May 1991 The Specified Discount Rate R is 16.2308% per annum, which in this case is also the yield to maturity as is verified in the schedule below. Therefore F = 0.028459 in the Period ending 15/5/1991 and 0.081154 in all the remaining Periods. (b) The following schedule may then be constructed, starting at the bottom and working up:— The present value at the beginning of the first Period is the same as the acquisition price, verifying that the Specified Discount Rate is equal to the yield to maturity for this particular transaction. Note that this will often not be the case. G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. Example B (a) This example illustrates Method B, using the same example as in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (except for the dates) and Determination G11B: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, Example B. On 12 March 1991 (the Specified Date) a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income— All amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars. Amounts are payable at regular halfyearly intervals, so that N = 2 and the preceding due date is 6 months prior to 15 May 1991, namely 15 November 1990. Also, T1 = T2 except for the first (broken) Period ending on 15 May 1991 for which T1 = 15/5/91 — 12/3/91 = 64 days, and T2 = 64 days + 12/3/91 — 15/11/90 = 181 days. The Specified Discount Rate R is 16.265% per annum, derived in Example B of Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Methods. (b) The following schedule may then be constructed, starting at the bottom and working up:— G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (See footnote to this Example B for details of the present value calculations using the HP-12C calculator.) The present value at the beginning of the first Period is the same as the acquisition price, verifying that the Specified Discount Rate is equal to the yield to maturity for this transaction. Footnote: Calculating the present values The “Present Values at Beginning” shown in the schedule may be calculated on an, HP12C or equivalent calculator, directly using the BOND PRICE function. The following steps reproduce the value at 15 November 1991 for example: 3. Example C (a) This illustrates the calculations involved in applying Method A to a straightforward perpetual security. The perpetual has a face value of 100, a yearly coupon of 10% payable half yearly, and was issued at 78.00 on 1 August 1991. This issuer is a New Zealand resident taxpayer with a 30 June balance date. The Specified Discount Rate, R, corresponding to this issue price is 12.82% p.a., derived in Example C of Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. G10B 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] in all periods, since N = 2. (b) At any payment date the formula (i) for Method A applies, and the present value is 4. Example D (a) This example illustrates the application of Method A to a more complicated perpetual note than in Example C. The note was issued at 90.00 on 1 February 1991. It has a nominal capital of 100, and has coupon interest at 14% p.a. commencing 1 August 1993 and payable halfyearly thereafter on 1 February and 1 August each year in perpetuity. The nominal capital is repayable only if the issuer defaults on an interest payment. The issuer is a New Zealand resident taxpayer with a 30 June balance date. The Specified Discount Rate, R, corresponding to this issue price is 12.261% p.a., derived in Example D of Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. in all periods, since N = 2. (b) The following schedule may then be constructed, starting in any period commencing on or after 1 February 1993: \*B for periods ending prior to 1/8/93 during which formula (ii) applies; E thereafter when formula (i) applies.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method Issued: 24 October 1990 G11A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method”. G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method made by the Commissioner on 21 November 1988. This determination differs from Determination G11 by the addition of an example of its application to perpetuities in which all payments are the same after some period. 2. This Determination states how the yield to maturity method shall be applied to a financial arrangement to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred for purposes of Section 64C of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. This Determination is an alternative to Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and will give very similar answers when used with Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. 4. The Determination applies to any financial arrangement where all the amounts and dates are known (or in the case of perpetuities the amounts of all payments due after a certain date, and the intervals at which they are payable, are able to be determined) not later than the first balance date of the issuer or holder after issue or acquisition, as the case may be, and determined in a single currency. 5. The approach adopted is to define a constant annual interest rate representing the yield to maturity of all the cash flows in the financial arrangement. Income derived and expenditure incurred is assumed to be compounded on the date of each payment. The calculations are simplified by using regular periods such as half years, months or weeks, where most of all of the cash flows occur at such intervals. However, where a period between payments is longer than one year, income derived and expenditure incurred must be compounded at yearly intervals. 6. In general, there is no explicit formula for a yield to maturity in terms of the cash flows. For purposes of this Determination, the yield to maturity is defined as the interest rate at which the Present Value of all amounts payable after the date of issue or acquisition is equal to the amount payable on that date. 7. The formulae and method for calculating the Present Value will depend on the nature of the financial arrangement and a number of alternatives will be published in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods for this purpose. 8. Persons may use either Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or this Determination for the purpose of applying the yield to maturity method to a financial arrangement. Once the person has elected to use Determination G3: Yield to Maturity G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Method or this Determination for a particular financial arrangement, the method set out in that Determination shall be used by the person over the life of that financial arrangement, unless the prior consent of the Commissioner is obtained to change methods. 9. At each balance date after the date of issue or acquisition, the Present Value of the arrangement is recalculated using the same formula and method as was used originally to calculate yield to maturity (see paragraph (6) above). 10. It will be noted that in the case of perpetuities there may not ever be a base price adjustment (see Example D). 11. The amount of income derived or expenditure incurred by the holder or issuer in respect of the Income Year ending on that balance date will be— In most normal commercial financial arrangements, the yield to maturity will be unique, positive and less than 100 percent per annum; arrangements that do not meet these criteria are excluded and may be submitted for individual consideration by the Commissioner. 2 Reference 1. This Determination is made pursuant to Section 64E(1)(a) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this Determination G11A is signed. 3 Scope of Determination This Determination applies to the class of financial arrangements that has the following attributes— G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) All amounts payable or receivable under the financial arrangement, and the dates on which those amounts are payable or receivable, are known (or, in the case of perpetuities, able to be determined) not later than the first balance date of the issuer or holder following the date of issue or acquisition, as the case may be; and (b) All amounts are determined in a single currency, but does not apply to any financial arrangement in respect of which the Annual Yield To Maturity Rate as defined in clause 5 of this Determination would be— (a) Not unique; or (b) Less than zero; or (c) Greater than 100 percent. 4 Principle The yield to maturity method apportions the total income or expenditure under a financial arrangement between income years so that the principal outstanding and accrued interest calculated as at any balance date represents the then Present Value of all amounts payable after that balance date, calculated in accordance with the formulae and method used to calculate the yield to maturity rate as at the date of issue or acquisition of the financial arrangement. 5 Interpretation 1. In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires— “Annual Yield To Maturity Rate”, in relation to a person and a financial arrangement, means the constant annual rate of interest at which the Present Value of all amounts payable to and by the person after the date of acquisition or issue of the financial arrangement, calculated as at that date, is equal to the net amount payable to or by the person on that date; “Income Year” has the same meaning as in Sections 64B to 64M of the Act; “Present Value”, in relation to a person and a financial arrangement and a day, means the discounted value on that day of all amounts payable to or by the person after that day, calculated in accordance with a formula and method specified in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, the amounts being discounted at a constant annual rate of interest; and for this purpose the Present Value of a financial arrangement shall be calculated using the Annual Yield To G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Maturity Rate in accordance with the formula and method that were used in the calculation of the Annual Yield To Maturity Rate of that financial arrangement. 2. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this Determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 3. In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used that are not defined in clause 5(1) have the same meanings as in Sections 2 and 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976. 4. Any reference in this Determination to another Determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as referring to any fresh Determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict or extend that Determination. 6 Method 1. This Determination may, at the election of the taxpayer, be used instead of Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. Once a taxpayer has made the election to use this Determination to apply the yield to maturity method to a financial arrangement the taxpayer shall then apply this Determination in respect of the financial arrangement until it matures or is remitted, sold or otherwise transferred by the taxpayer unless the prior consent of the Commissioner is obtained to change methods. Any such consent may be given conditionally. 2. The amount of income derived or expenditure incurred by the holder or issuer in respect of any Income Year (other than an Income Year to which Section 64F of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies) shall be— G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 Example 1. Example A a) This is the same example as in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (except for the dates). It is used to demonstrate that the methods give similar results. On 12 March 1991 a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income: The holder balances on 31 March. All amounts are in New Zealand currency. It will be found that the Annual Yield To Maturity Rate (R) is 16.2308% per annum; see Example A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. b) The present values at the end of each Income Year, calculated according to Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, are set out in the following schedule— NOTE: See example A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods for these present values G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] c) The following schedule may then be constructed, showing the income in respect of each Income Year— NOTE: (i) $1,020,887 − $1,012,500 = $8,387 (ii) $1,038,895 − $1,020,887 + $140,000 = $158,008 (iii) Calculated using the formula for the base price adjustment in Section 64F(2) of the Act: a − (b + c) Where a = $70,000 + $70,000 + $70,000 + $1,070,000 = $1,280,000, the sum of all amounts payable to the holder, and b = $1,012,500, the acquisition price, and c = $8,387 + $158,008 = $166,395, the amount of income derived to date by the holder. Note that this is confirmed by extending the same calculation procedure used for 1991 and 1992, into 1993 as follows:— a = 0, the Present Value at the end of the 1993 Income Year. b = 0 c = $1,140,000, the payments by the issuer in the year. d = $1,038,895, the Present Value at the previous balance date. Hence a − b + c − d = $101,105. G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. Example B a) This example is also similar to that in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (except for the dates). On 12 March 1991 a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income:— The holder balances on 31 March. All amounts are in New Zealand currency. This income would be typical of a New Zealand Government Stock with a 14% coupon maturing 15 November 1992. Under Method B of calculating the Present Value of a financial arrangement, it is calculated that the Annual Yield To Maturity Rate is 16.265%. This is the interest rate at which the Present Value of payments due after 12 March 1991 is equal to $1,012,500. See the foot note to this Example B for details of calculation using the HP-12C calculator. b) The present values at the end of each Income Year are calculated using Method B of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. The method is the same as that adopted by the International Association of Bond Dealers and used in the HP- 12C and similar calculators. The calculation of present values in Example B may be made using the BOND PRICE function on the HP12C (or equivalent) calculator. The following steps reproduce the “Present Value at year end” for the Income Year ending 31 March 1991: which is the per $100 nominal price corresponding to $1,020,846. G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] c) The following schedule may then be constructed:- Note: (i) $1,020,846 − $1,012,500 = $8,346 (ii) $1,039,241 − $1,020,846 + $140,000 = $158,395 (iii) Calculated using the formula for the base price adjustment in Section 64F(2) of the Act. a − (b + c) Where: a = $70,000 + $70,000 + $70,000 + $1,070,000 = $1,280,000, the sum of all amounts payable to the holder, b = $1,012,500, the acquisition price, and c = $8,346 + $158,395 = $166,741, the amount of income derived to date by the holder. Note that this is confirmed by extending the same calculation procedure used for 1991 and 1992, into 1993 as follows:— a = 0, is the Present Value at the end of the 1993 Income Year. b = 0 c = $1,140,000, are the payments by the issuer in the year. d = $1,039,241, is the Present Value at the previous balance date. Hence a − b + c − d = $100,759. G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Footnote: The calculations may be made using the BOND PRICE function on the HP-12C (or equivalent) calculator. Calculating the Specified Discount Rate, R The HP-12C assumes that the purchase price excludes accrued interest, whereas the actual purchase price of $1,012,500 includes accrued interest from 15 November 1990 to 12 March 1991. This accrued interest is calculated as follows, per $100 nominal: This accrued interest is then subtracted from the purchase price per $100 nominal, of $101.25, to give the ex-accrued interest purchase price. The Specified Discount Rate (R) can then be calculated using the BOND YTM function; 3. Example C a) This example illustrates the application of this determination to a straightforward perpetual security. It is identical to Example C in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. The perpetual has a face value of 100, a yearly coupon of 10% paid half yearly, and was issued at 78.00 on 1 August 1991. The issuer is a New Zealand resident taxpayer with a 30 June balance date. First we have to calculate the Annual Yield to Maturity Rate. Although outside the scope of this determination this can be done as follows: G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Since all payments are the same, Method A formula (i) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods applies. The present value is 78.00 at the date of issue which is equal to: E F where, E is the half yearly coupon, 5%. Therefore, whence and so the Specified Discount Rate in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods is and this is the Annual Yield to Maturity Rate. b) Since the balance date is not a date on which an amount is payable, formula (ii) of Method A must be used to calculate the present value at the balance date, using the present value as at the immediately succeeding payment date and the payment then due. c) There are 32 days from 30 June to 1 August so that in all years— G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] From Example C of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, the present values at each balance date are calculated as follows: Note: C = 0 in all cases (1) calculated as (A + B − C)/(1 + F) 1) Calculated as (A + B – C)/(1 + F) d) The following schedule may then be constructed, showing the expenditure incurred by the issuer in respect of each income year: Notes: (i) 82.08 − 78.00 = 4.08 (ii) 82.08 + 10.00 − 82.08 = 10.00 G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The constant expenditure from 30 June 1992 income year onwards is to be expected, and would only change if the issuer's balance date changed, or there was a change in the terms of the security. Unless the perpetual security is repaid under the terms of its issue (such as default), there will never be a base price adjustment. 4. Example D a) This example illustrates the application of Method A to a more complicated perpetual note than in Example C. It is identical to Example D in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. The note was issued at 90.00 on 1 February 1991. It has a nominal capital of 100 and has coupon interest at 14% p.a. commencing on 1 August 1993 and payable halfyearly thereafter on 1 February and 1 August each year in perpetuity. The nominal capital is repayable only if the issuer defaults on a coupon payment. The issuer is a New Zealand resident taxpayer with a 30 June balance date. The first step is to determine the Annual Yield To Maturity Rate. This must be done by trial and error. The process is as follows: (i) Estimate F, the interest rate per period in decimal form. (For example, an Annual Yield To Maturity Rate of 14% payable quarterly gives F = 0.035). (ii) Using Method A formula (i) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, calculate the present value as at the first payment date after which all amounts payable are the same, in this case as at 1/2/93. (iii) Then calculate the present value at the issue date, using Method A formula (ii) of Determination G10B. Often this can be accomplished quickly on a financial calculator. (iv) Compare this present value to the issue price and make a better estimate of F. (v) If F is not sufficiently accurate (generally ascertained by comparing it with the previous value, or comparing the present value to the issue price) go back to step (i). In the present case, the following HP-12C program will enable successive estimates of F to be tested: G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This gives the present value E/F as at 1/2/93 of all payments after that date. (FV) (PV) (RCL) 1 (+) This gives the difference between the issue price and the present value. (g) (GTO) 00 (f) (R/S) to end. Calculating Estimate half yearly interest rate, press (i), then press (R/S). Therefore the Annual Yield to Maturity Rate is 2 × 6.1305% = 12.261% p.a. Other programs might be needed in other examples. G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b) Since the balance date is not a date on which an amount is payable, formula (ii) of Method A must be used to calculate the present value as the balance date, using the present value as at the immediately succeeding payment date and the payment then due. c) There are 32 days from 30 June to 1 August so that in all years— From Example D of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, the present values at each balance date are calculated as follows: (i) Calculated as (A + B − C)/(1 + F) where— therefore (A + B − C)/(1 + F) = (95.52 + 0 − 0)/1.01075 = 94.50 (ii) (A + B − C)/(1 + F) = 107.58 + 0 − 0/1.01075 = 106.44 G11A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (iii) (A + B − C)/(1 + F) = (114.18 + 7 − 0)/1.01075 = 119.89 d) The following schedule may then be constructed, showing the expenditure incurred by the issuer in respect of each Income Year: Notes: (i) 94.50 − 90.00 = 4.50 (ii) 106.44 − 94.50 = 11.94 (iii) 119.89 − 106.44 = 13.45 (iv) 119.89 + 14.00 − 119.89 = 14.00 The constant expenditure from the 30 June 1994 income year onwards is to be expected, and would only change if the issuer's balance date changed, or there was a change in the terms of the security. Unless the note is repaid under the terms of its issue (such as default) or sold, then there will never be a base price adjustment. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.

G12 21 November 1988 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination applies where a person is a holder or an issuer of a financial arrangement and— (a) Section 64C(2) of the Act does not apply (ie it is not possible to calculate the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method); and (b) Section 64C(3)(a) of the Act does not apply (ie the Commissioner has issued no other determination that provides a method of accounting for the financial arrangement); and (c) The person does not report the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement for financial reporting purposes. 2. Where this determination applies in relation to a person and a financial arrangement, the person is required to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement using a method that— (a) Has regard to the principles of accrual accounting; and (b) Conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and (c) Results in the allocation to each income year of an amount that, having regard to the tenor of section 64C(2) of the Act is fair and reasonable. 3. Any method adopted under this determination for calculating the income derived or expenditure incurred by a person in respect of a financial arrangement and an income year is required to be consistently applied. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) of the Act. 3 Scope of Determination This determination applies where a person is a holder or an issuer of financial arrangement and— G12 21 November 1988 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) Sections 64C(2) and 64C(3)(a) of the Act do not apply in relation to the person and the financial arrangement; and (b) For financial reporting purposes the person does not report the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement. 4 Principle 1. Where this determination applies to a person and a financial arrangement in an income year, the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement and the income year shall be calculated using a method that has regard to the purpose of section 64C of the Act. 2. Where pursuant to this determination a person adopts a method for calculating the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of a financial arrangement and an income year, the person shall adopt that method in respect of all such financial arrangements. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,— Words and expressions used shall have the same meanings as in the Act, except that where there is a conflict between the meaning of an expression in sections 64B to 64M of the Act and the meaning of the expression elsewhere in the Act the expression shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976. 6 Method 1. Where— a) This determination applies in respect of a person and a financial arrangement and an income year; and b) For financial reporting purposes the person does not report the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement using a method that has regard to the principles of accrual accounting— G12 21 November 1988 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement and the income year shall be calculated using a method that— c) Has regard to the principles of accrual accounting; and d) Conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and e) Results in the allocation to each income year of an amount that, having regard to the tenor of section 64C(2) of the Act is fair and reasonable. 2. Where this determination applies in relation to a person and a financial arrangement and an income year, the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement and the income year shall be calculated using the method used to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred in the income year by the person in respect every other such financial arrangement to which this determination applies. 7 Example Financial arrangement not reported for financial reporting purposes 1. An individual's assets include a reviewable rate mortgage acquired on 1 October 1988. The first interest payment on the mortgage is due on 30 September 1989. The individual does not prepare any financial reports. 2. At 1 October 1988 the Commissioner had issued no determination that prescribed a method of accounting for such a financial arrangement. This determination therefore applies and the taxpayer must report the income in his or her income tax return using a method that satisfies clause 6(4)(c), (d) and (e) of this determination. 3. For the purpose of calculating the income derived from the mortgage by the individual in the year ending 31 March 1988, the following method is acceptable under this determination. The amount of the income could be calculated by apportioning the interest receivable at the first payment date following balance date to the appropriate accounting periods on a straight line daily basis over the days in the period to which the payment relates. G12 21 November 1988 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Prices or Yields Issued: 24 October 1990 G13A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G13A: Prices or Yields”. G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G13: Prices or Yields made on the 8th day of February 1989. 2. This determination applies where for the purpose of calculating the income or expenditure of a person it is necessary to determine a price or yield for valuation purposes. This may arise where a person wishes to calculate income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement pursuant to section 64C(4) of the Act. (For example, in the application of a market valuation method for calculating the amount of income derived by a person in respect of New Zealand Government Stock in an income year.) 3. Apart from minor amendments, this determination differs from Determination G13: Prices or Yields by allowing the use of prices or yields other than those at which the person could deal. The method for finding such an alternative price or yield must be adopted for financial reporting purposes and must produce a price or yield that does not result in a more favourable result for tax purposes. For example where the holder of Government Stock values its holdings, for financial reporting purposes, by taking the price mid-way between the buy and sell price it may also use this method for calculating its income or expenditure for tax purposes. 4. The criteria for approval of a market for this purpose are similar to those required for the approval of a foreign currency market (Determination G6C: Foreign Currency Rates refers). These are the indicators of a “free” and accessible market. 5. Where it is necessary to ascertain a price or yield for the purpose of section 64C(4) of the Act (market value methods of accounting), the price or yield to be used is found by reference to a market in which the person could deal. For example, where there is a Euromarket and a domestic market in the same class of securities, the person is required to use prices from the market to which the person has access. It is assumed that where a person has access to two such markets, arbitrageurs will ensure that prices in the two markets will not differ materially. 6. Where a person owns securities or has bought securities for forward delivery (i.e. is “long in the security”), the price to be used is the buying or bid price (i.e. the price at which the market would be prepared to buy the security for appropriate delivery date). Where the person has “short sold” securities, the price to be used is the selling or offer price (i.e. the price at which the market would be prepared to sell the security for the appropriate delivery date). Alternatively, in either case, the person may use a method which finds a price which falls between the two prices. This method must be adopted G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] for financial reporting purposes and produce a result which is no more favourable for tax purposes. 7. Where sources of information for approved markets do not show price or yield quotations for the maturity of the security to be priced, commercially acceptable forms of interpolation or extrapolation may be used based on quoted prices or yields for securities of different maturities that are otherwise identical to the security in question. 8. Section 64C(4) of the Act may not be applied in relation to a financial arrangement if no market or method or source of information for the financial arrangement is approved in a determination made by the Commissioner. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(d) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G13: Prices or Yields made on the 8th day of February 1989. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply where it is necessary for the purposes of section 64C(4) of the Act to determine the price or yield of a financial arrangement. 4 Principle 1.

Sources of information in relation to a market are approved having regard to the following criteria— a) Reliance on the source of information; b) The accessibility of the source of information to participants in the market; c) Whether the persons providing the information at a source are prepared to act upon the information supplied at the source. 3. Methods of obtained prices or yields at the end of the income year for the purpose of valuing a financial arrangement are approved if— a) The price or yield is obtained at the Cut-off Time; and b) The method for determining the Cut-off Time adopted by the person will be consistently applied in respect of each income year. 4.

G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1991 the Reuters Multicontributor Page, NZGS, had quotes of 16.42% (buy) and 16.38% (sell). A rate of 16.42% would be appropriate for the valuation of this holding as at 30 September 1991 in accordance with clause 6(3)(a), clause 6(4)(a), and clause 6(7)(a) of this determination. Note: To obtain the value of the Government Stock it is necessary to use this rate in an appropriate valuation formula. b) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1992 there were no Multicontributor quotations available. However, for an identical issue of Government Stock the following quotes were obtained from a broker active in the market and from Contributor Pages supplied by brokers active in the market: The appropriate rate, determined in accordance with clause 6(7)(b) of this determination, is the arithmetic mean of the buy quotes, i.e. 15.88%. c) At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1993 there were no Multicontributor quotations available for this particular stock. The following quotations were available from the Multicontributor Page, NZGS, for two similar stocks: Clause 6(7) of this determination applies and a form of Interpolation between these quotations is to be used. If the corporate investor chooses to use linear interpolation, the required yield is calculated as follows: G13A 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The relevant buy quotes and terms are: From 15/6/94 to 15/9/94: 92 days The required valuation yield is calculated under straight line interpolation: ((31 × 15.10) + (61 × 15.06))/92 = 15.07% d) An alternative method At the Cut-off Time on 30 September 1991 the Reuters Multicontributor Page, NZGS, had quotes of 16.42% (buy) and 16.38% (sell). The corporate investor uses the mid point between the buy and sell rate for financial reporting purposes and a rate of 16.40% would be appropriate for the valuation of this holding as at 30 September 1991 in accordance with clause 6(3)(a), clause 6(4)(b) and clause 6(7)(a) of this determination. Note: To obtain the value of the Government Stock it is necessary to use this rate in an appropriate valuation formula.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities Issued: 4 May 1989 G14 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities”. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. Income or expenditure under forward contracts can be calculated on the mark to market method under section 64C(4) of the Act by traders (or by any person if the contract is for foreign exchange). This determination provides a method of accruing for taxation purposes the income or expenditure under a forward contract where section 64C(4) cannot be applied, or where the person chooses not to apply section 64C(4). 2. For example, a foreign exchange forward contract is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of a currency at a future date at a price fixed (in terms of another currency) at the time the contract is entered into. Each party contracts to simultaneously sell one currency and purchase another currency. This means that the same forward contract can be viewed as either the sale of one currency or the purchase of the other currency. To establish which transaction is occurring for tax purposes, a person must identify one of the currencies as a “base currency” and the contract will be viewed as the sale or purchase of the “non-base” currency as appropriate. For example, a person who sells NZD forward against purchase of USD can view the contract as either— (a) The forward sale of NZD, if the person's base currency is USD, or (b) The forward purchase of USD, if the person's base currency is NZD. The choice of base currency merely fixes the direction of the cash flows under the forward contract; it does not affect the amounts reported for tax purposes although it may affect the incidence. Each party to a forward contract is both a vendor and a purchaser. Since each party is a vendor in relation to the forward contract, each is deemed to be a holder under the definition of “holder” in section 64B(1) of the Act. 3. This determination also applies to swap contracts for fixed amounts, to be exchanged at a single fixed date. 4. Under a forward contract, the currency to be purchased is a “deferred asset” of the person and the currency to be sold is a “deferred liability” of the person. This does not depend on which currency is chosen as the base currency. In the example first given, the forward sale of NZD is a deferred liability and the forward purchase of USD is a deferred asset, irrespective of which base currency is chosen. This is because the forward contract can be regarded as equivalent to— (a) borrowing in NZD, the currency being sold (creating a “liability”), G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) converting the proceeds to USD at the spot rate, and (c) lending in USD, the currency being bought (creating an “asset”). However, if the sale and purchase currencies are interchanged, or the position of the other party to the forward contract is considered, then the asset and liability currencies are also interchanged. 5. The total income derived or expenditure incurred under the forward contract (expressed in the base currency) is the difference between the values of the non-base currency at— (a) The spot rate when the forward contract is delivered; and (b) The forward rate at which the contract was entered into. Because the delivery spot rate will not be known until the actual delivery date of the contract, it is necessary to provide an accrual method during the course of the contract. 6. Any difference between the forward rate and the spot rate is a reflection of different interest rates in the two currencies. If the spot rate when the contract is delivered has become exactly equal to the forward rate under the contract, then this interest differential will have been exactly offset by the changes in the capital values of the deferred asset and liability. The accrual method used in this determination follows this expected change in spot rates: (a) The initial premium or discount, between the spot rate and the forward rate, is accrued over the term of the contract, and (b) The contract is revalued to current spot rates each year. 7. The rationale for determining “which way round” these items should be is as follows:— (a) Accrual of premium or discount (i) At the date the contract is issued the value of the non-base currency is converted into the base currency at the then spot rate. (ii) If the non-base currency has been bought then it comprises a deferred asset. This asset is being purchased at a discount where the spot value is greater than the forward value, and at a premium where the spot value is less than the forward value. Accrual of a discount is income, and accrual of a premium is expenditure. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (iii) If the non-base currency has been sold then it comprises a deferred liability. This liability is being sold at a premium where the spot value is greater than the forward value, and at a discount where the spot value is less than the forward value. Accrual of a discount is expenditure, and accrual of a premium is income. (iv) This can be presented in table form as follows:— \* This is the amount (a − b) in clause 7(1) where— a = accrual at year end b = accrual at year beginning, of the premium or discount. This table can be summarised by saying that for a vendor of the base currency, a negative amount of (a − b) is income, and a positive amount is expenditure, and conversely for a purchaser. (b) Spot rates (i) At each balance date the value of the non-base currency is converted into the base currency at the then spot rate. (ii) If the non-base currency has been bought then it comprises a deferred asset. In this case an increase in value of the non-base currency is income, and a decrease is expenditure. (iii) If the non-base currency has been sold then it comprises a deferred liability. In this case an increase in the value of the non-base currency is expenditure, and a decrease is income. (iv) This can be presented in table form as follows:— G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] \* This is the amount (c − d) in clause 7(1) where— c = spot value at year end d = spot value at year beginning This table can be summarised by saying that for a vendor of the base currency, a positive amount of (c − d) is income, and a negative amount is expenditure, and conversely for a purchaser. (c) Since the wording at the end of item (a)(iv) is the same as item (b)(iv) except for the words “positive” and “negative”, by changing the sign of the latter, the results can be combined as— (a - b) - (c - d) with the conclusion that, for a vendor of the base currency, where this amount is negative it is income and where this amount is positive it is expenditure, and conversely for a purchaser. 8. In summary, the accrual method is as follows: (a) Accrual of premium or discount The difference between the value of the non-base currency calculated using— (i) the spot rate, and (ii) the contract rate, as at the contract entry or acquisition date, represents the premium or discount in the base currency. This premium or discount is accrued over the term of the contract using Method A or B of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods (or any other method producing substantially similar results), as follows:— (A) The yield to maturity rate is calculated as at the contract entry or acquisition date. This is the rate at which: the present value of the value of the non-base currency calculated using the contract rate is equal to— the value of the non-base currency calculated using the spot rate. The yield to maturity rate will be positive if the value at the contract rate exceeds the value at the spot rate, and conversely. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (B) At each balance date the present value of the non-base currency calculated using the contract rate is determined at the yield to maturity rate. The change in present value since the previous balance date (or contract entry or acquisition date, if later) is brought to account as income or expenditure. All amounts are expressed in the base currency. (b) Accrual of change in value at spot rates At each balance date, the non-base currency is revalued into the base currency using the spot rate. The change in value since the previous balance date (or contract entry or acquisition date, if later) is brought to account as income or expenditure. (c) Total The accrual income or expenditure in any income year is— (i) the change in accrual premium or discount, less (ii) the change in value at spot rates, over the year, calculated in the base currency. The exact details of allocation to income and expenditure are covered in clause 1(7). Where necessary, the accrual income or expenditure is then converted into New Zealand dollars at the spot price as at the end of the income year. (d) Base Price Adjustment. In the year the financial arrangement is redeemed or disposed of, a base price adjustment is calculated in New Zealand dollars. 9. Where the contract has a term of less than a year, it is not necessary to go through the process in full detail. Exactly equivalent results will be obtained by calculating the present value at the balance date as the accrued premium or discount on an actual days/actual days basis, to give “a” in the formula shown in clause 7(1). 10. Note that this determination does not apply to agreements for the sale and purchase of property as defined in Section 64B(1) of the Act, and that for this purpose, property includes trading stock. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Scope of Determination 1. This determination shall apply where it is necessary to calculate the income deemed to be derived or the expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a forward contract for foreign exchange and commodities, to which the person becomes a party after the day on which this determination is signed. 2. This determination shall not apply to any— (a) Futures contract: (b) Swap contract, other than a swap contract involving— (i) A spot exchange at the current market spot rate; and (ii) A future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date: (c) Option contract: (d) Security arrangement: (e) Agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 4 Principle 1. A forward contract gives rise to a net gain or loss to the taxpayer if the spot price of the currency on the date the contract is fulfilled is different from the rate specified under the forward contract. That net gain or loss is to be recognised for tax purposes on an accrual basis in two parts— (a) The difference between the contract price and the spot price on the date the contract was entered into is spread over the term of the contract using a yield to maturity method; (b) At each balance date the change in spot price since the previous balance date (or the date on which the contract was entered into, if later) is brought into income or expenditure. 2. Both parties to a forward contract are holders, and each holder must nominate one of the currencies under the contract as a base currency in terms of which all accrual income or expenditure is to be calculated. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expression used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M. “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976; “Annual yield to maturity rate”, in relation to a person and a forward contract, means the constant annual rate of interest at which the present value of the forward value calculated as at the commencement date of the contract is equal to the spot value as at that date; “Base currency”, in relation to a person and a forward contract, means the currency under the forward contract which is adopted by the person as a reference currency for the purposes of this determination; “Commencement date” of a forward contract means the date on which the contract was entered into, or the date on which it was acquired, if later; “Contract forward price”, in relation to a forward contract means the price of one currency expressed in terms of the other currency under the contract; “Currency” includes any commodity; “Forward value”, in relation to a forward contract, means the value expressed in the base currency of the non-base currency, calculated at the contract forward price; “NZD” means the currency of New Zealand; “Non-base currency” means the currency under a forward contract that is not the base currency; “Present value”, in relation to a forward contract and a day, means the discounted value on that day of the forward value, calculated in accordance with Method A or Method B of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods (or a method producing substantially similar results), and for this purpose the present value shall be calculated using the annual yield to maturity rate of that contract; “Spot contract” means a contract for the sale or purchase of a currency for delivery in 2 business days; “Spot Price” means a price or rate quoted for spot contracts. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Spot value”, in relation to a forward contract and a day, means the value of the amount of the non-base currency, which value is expressed in the base currency and calculated at the spot price on that day. 2. Any reference in this determination to any other determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6 Method 1. Subject to subclause (2) of this clause, the income or expenditure in respect of a forward contract and an income year (other than an income year to which section 64F of the Act applies) shall be calculated according to the following formula: (a − b) − (c − d) where— a is the amount of the present value of the forward contract in relation to the person at the end of the income year; b is the amount of the present value of the forward contract in relation to the person at the later of the end of the immediately preceding income year, or the commencement date; c is the spot value of the forward contract in relation to the person at the end of the income year; d is the spot value of the forward contract at the later of the end of the immediately preceding income year or the commencement date— and the amount so calculated shall be deemed to be (a) expenditure incurred if— (i) the amount is positive and the person is the vendor of the base currency, or (ii) the amount is negative and the person is the purchaser of the base currency. (b) income derived, in any other case. 2. Where the base currency adopted by the person in relation to a forward contract and an income year is not New Zealand currency, the amount of the income derived or expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the forward contract shall be the G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] amount calculated in the base currency pursuant to sub-clause (1) of this clause, converted into NZD as at the end of that income year in accordance with sub-clause (3) of this clause. 3. Where— (a) An amount at any time is expressed in a currency other than NZD and; (b) It is necessary to convert the amount to NZD or otherwise to calculate the value of the amount in NZD; the exchange rate for the purpose of the calculation shall be— (c) Where the matter is dealt with in a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1) of the Act, the spot price at the time and so determined; (d) Where the exchange rate is not dealt with in a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1) of the Act and the amount is expressed in a currency for which there is an accessible and active market in NZD, an exchange rate determined in a manner consistent with determinations made by the Commissioner for the purpose of ascertaining the spot price for any currency; (e) In any other circumstance, a spot price at which an arm's length dealing would be expected to take place at the time. 7 Examples For convenience in these examples when calculating the base price adjustment, the same buy/sell spot rates have been used at date of delivery. In practice this would not normally be the case. Example A: Seller of Base Currency; Appreciating Non-Base Currency (a) A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in three years time (This could be the forward leg of a swap, where the other leg is a spot exchange on 30 April 1988 at the market spot rate). The contract was entered into on 30 April 1988 and the corporate has a balance date of 30 June. The contract forward rate is 0.5300 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD 1,886,792. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Suppose that over the term of the contract the spot USD/NZD rates are: Using Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, at yearly intervals, the annual yield to maturity rate is 6.210% p.a., at which rate the present value of NZD 1,886,792 payable on 30 April 1991 is equal to NZD 1,574,803, the spot value on 30 April 1988. (b) The present values of NZD 1,886,792 at the three subsequent balance dates are as follows:— Notes (1) Discount by the 304 days from 30 April 1991 to 30 June 1990— 1,886,792/(1 + 0.06210 × 304/365) = 1,794,003 (2) Discount by a further year to 30 June 1989— 1,794,003/(1 + 0.06210) = 1,689,110 (3) And by a further year to 30 June 1988— 1,689,110/(1 + 0.06210) = 1,590,349 The following schedule sets out the calculations. Since the corporate is a vendor of the base currency, positive amounts are expenditure incurred and negative amounts are income derived:— G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (c) In the 30 June 1991 income year, the Base Price Adjustment given in section 64F is calculated by applying the formula: a − (b + c). Therefore, the Base Price Adjustment = a − (b + c) = NZD − 36,587 and since this is negative, the amount of NZD 36,587 is deemed to be an allowable deduction (section 64F(4)(a)). Note that in the final 30 June 1991 income year, the formula set out in this determination would have given the same result, since— a = NZD 1,886,792 b = NZD 1,794,003 c = NZD 1,795,332 d = NZD 1,739,130 whence— (a − b) − (c − d) = NZD 36,587 which, being a positive amount, would be expenditure incurred. G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example B: Buyer of Base Currency; Appreciating Non-Base Currency (a) A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to sell 1 million US dollars (USD) against purchase of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in three years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1988 and the corporate has a balance date of 30 June. The contract forward rate is 0.5300 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require purchase of NZD 1,886,792. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. Suppose that over the term of the contract the spot USD/NZD rates are: Using Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, at yearly intervals, the annual yield to maturity rate is 6.210% pa, at which rate the present value of NZD 1,886,792 payable on 30 April 1991 is equal to NZD 1,574,803, the spot value on 30 April 1988. (b) The present values of NZD 1,886,792 at the three subsequent balance dates are as follows:— Notes (1) Discount by the 304 days from 30 April 1991 to 30 June 1990— 1,886,792/(1 + 0.06210 × 304/365) = 1,794,003 (2) Discount by a further year to 30 June 1989— 1,794,003/(1 + 0.06210) = 1,689,110 (3) And by a further year to 30 June 1988— 1,689,110/(1 + 0.06210) = 1,590,349 G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The following schedule sets out the calculations. Since the corporate is a purchaser of the base currency, positive amounts are income derived and negative amounts are expenditure incurred:— (c) In the 30 June 1991 income year, the Base Price Adjustment given in section 64F is calculated by applying the formula: Therefore, the Base Price Adjustment = a − (b + c) = NZD 36,587 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD 36,587 is deemed to be income derived (section 64F(4)(a)). Note that in the final 30 June 1991 income year, the formula set out in this determination would have given the same result, since— a = NZD 1,886,792 b = NZD 1,794,003 c = NZD 1,795,332 d = NZD 1,739,130 G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] whence— (a − b) − (c − d) = NZD 36,587 which, being a positive amount, would be income derived. Example C: Seller of Base Currency; Depreciating Non-Base Currency (a) A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long term forward foreign exchange contract to sell 1 million US dollars (USD) against purchase of New Zealand dollars (NZD) in three years time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 1988 and the corporate has a balance date of 30 June. The contract forward rate is 0.5300 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require purchase of NZD 1,886,792. The corporate chooses USD as the base currency for this contract. Suppose that over the term of the contract the spot USD/NZD rates are: Using Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, at yearly intervals, the annual yield to maturity rate is −5.847% p.a., at which rate the present value of USD 1,000,000 payable on 30 April 1991 is equal to USD 1,198,113, the spot value on 30 April 1988. (b) The present values of USD 1,000,000 at the three subsequent balance dates are as follows:— Notes (1) Discount by the 304 days from 30 April 1991 to 30 June 1990— 1,000,000/(1 − 0.05847 × 304/365) = 1,051,191 G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (2) Discount by a further year to 30 June 1989— 1,051,191/(1 − 0.05847) = 1,116,471 (3) And by a further year to 30 June 1988— 1,116,471/(1 − 0.05847) = 1,185,805 The following schedule sets out the calculations. Since the corporate is vendor of the base currency, positive amounts are expenditure incurred and negative amounts are income derived:— (c) The amounts of income derived or expenditure incurred in each income year have then to be converted to NZD at the spot price at 30 June, as follows:— (d) In the 30 June 1991 income year, the Base Price Adjustment given in section 64F is calculated by applying the formula: a − (b + c) where all amounts are expressed in NZD, and— G14 4 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and since this is positive, the amount of NZD 31,937 is deemed to be income derived (section 64F(4)(a)).

About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
1 Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach”. This determination cancels and replaces Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What is a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? A forward contract for foreign exchange or commodities is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of foreign currency or commodities at some future date at a specified contract rate. For example, a forward contract for foreign currency is a contract to buy or sell specified amounts of a currency at a future date at a price fixed (in terms of another currency) at the time the contract is entered into. Each party contracts simultaneously to sell one currency and purchase another currency. The same forward contract can always be viewed as either the sale of one currency or the purchase of the other currency. For example, a person who sells NZD forward against purchase of USD can view the contract as either— • the forward sale of NZD, or • the forward purchase of USD. A forward contract has characteristics that are very similar to a swap contract. In fact, swaps are often structured as a series of forward contracts. If you are a party to a swap, however, you may not apply this determination as swaps are subject to Determination G27. The only exception is a swap contract for fixed amounts, to be exchanged at a single fixed date. This type of swap is, in substance, a forward contract. Therefore, if you are a party to this type of forward contract, you have to apply this determination instead of Determination G27. When do you use this determination? You must use this determination for the 2003–04 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you are not a member of a group of companies and on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting 2 period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for the 2004–05 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you entered the forward contract after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2003–04 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach or Determination G14A; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year and a forward contract for which this determination applies if— • you entered the forward contract after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2004–05 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach or Determination G14A; • you entered the forward contract before the date of this determination and you have made a return of your income or expenditure for an earlier income year and the forward contract on the basis of Determination G14A and are required under section 90 or sections 90AC and 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make a return for the income year and the financial arrangement under this determination; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and 3 (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. You may not use this determination for an income year unless you are required to do so by the above paragraphs. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure under a Forward Contract for Foreign Exchange and Commodities? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a forward contract. This expected value approach can only be used for forward contracts within the scope of this determination, which is narrower than Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities. If you are required to use this determination, you must not use Determination G14 for any such forward contract, and you must not use Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars for any financial arrangement within the scope of Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. Mark to Spot Approach You may use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract within the scope of this determination if you are not required to use this determination or Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act or the market valuation method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 36 of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(6) of the Act or by section EH 38(2) of the Act. 4 How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a forward contract is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. A typical forward contract drawn at the forward rate for no consideration, however, has no expected component. To apply this method to a forward contract for the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must— • ignore any offsetting of payments between the parties, so that every amount that would be payable under the forward contract is taken into account under this determination; and • choose one of the currencies under the forward contract as a base currency; and • determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the forward contract when you become a party to the contract, which consist of— (a) the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the contract; (b) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; (c) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate; and • convert the expected base currency payments, where the base currency is not NZD, into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates available at the time you become a party to the forward contract; and • spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the forward contract. To apply this method for the first time to a forward contract for an income year after the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must calculate the gross income or expenditure of the forward contract as set out above, except that you must— • in determining the expected component of the gross income or expenditure, use actual NZD payments up to the income year for which you first use this determination for the forward contract and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the forward contract; and • in calculating the expected NZD payments, use the relevant forward rates as at the end of the income year for which you first use this determination for the forward contract. You must perform the base price adjustment under whichever is appropriate of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 47 of the Act when a forward contract you are a party to matures or is disposed of. This adjustment contains the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure of the forward contract. You must also calculate a transition allowance for a financial arrangement to which you apply the method for the first time for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement. 5 How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? Election for 2003–04 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the day that is the end of your accounting period for the 2003–04 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period for the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. Election for 2004–05 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the 2004–05 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. 6 Election for income years beginning after 2004–05 income year If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? The transitional adjustment must be made for the first income year for which you are required to use this determination for a forward contract if you entered the forward contract before the income year and you have not been required to apply Determination G14A for the forward contract. The calculation is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. The transitional adjustment requires that for the income year of the adjustment you treat as gross income or expenditure the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as described in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the forward contract matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment in whichever of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 47 of the Act is applicable to the forward contract. 2.

(5) If you must use this determination, you may not use— (a) Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within subparagraphs (1) and (2) above; (b) Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement that is within the scope of Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. (Note: A determination to which Determination G14B refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 9 4. Principle (1) If you are a party to a forward contract to which this determination applies, the gross income or expenditure in respect of the forward contract is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2) The gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is the total of an expected component and the unexpected component. (3) If you must apply this determination to a forward contract for the income year in which you enter the forward contract, you must measure the expected component as at the time you enter the forward contract. (4) To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates as at the time you become a party to the forward contract and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the contract. (5) If you must apply this determination for the first time to a forward contract for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the forward contract, and you have not applied Determination G14A for the forward contract, you must measure the expected component as at the end of the income year. You must follow the principle set out above by calculating the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD payments up to the end of the income year in which you first apply the determination and the forward rates as at the end of that income year. (6) You must recognise the unexpected component for a forward contract by performing the base price adjustment that is required under whichever is applicable of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 45 of the Act. Transitional adjustment (7) For the first income year for which you must use this determination, you must perform the transitional adjustment calculation to calculate gross income or expenditure for all forward contracts— (a) that you entered before the income year; and (b) for which you have not been required to use Determination G14A. (8) This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you first use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in subparagraph (4), were known and this determination had been used since you became a party to the forward contract. 10 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) In this determination— base currency in relation to a person and a forward contract, means the currency under the forward contract which is adopted by the person as a reference currency for the purposes of this determination commencement date of a forward contract means the date on which the contract was entered into, or the date on which it was acquired, if later contract rate in relation to a forward contract means the price of one currency expressed in terms of the other currency under the forward contract covered interest parity means the proposition that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 period ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by 1 plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by 1 plus the domestic interest rate, i d . Forward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as— (1 + i f ) n Fwd t,n = S t × (1 + i d ) n currency includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement exchange rate means the price of 1 currency expressed in another currency forward rate means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case where the base currency is a commodity, the forward rate is the future value of the commodity (in NZD) future value in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially- acceptable, market-based method of valuation NZD means the currency of New Zealand non-base currency means the currency under a forward contract that is not the base currency spot contract means a contract for the sale or purchase of a currency for delivery in 2 business days 11 spot rate means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity spot value in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation USD means the currency of the United States of America. (3) All other terms used have the meaning given to them for the purpose of the Act. 6. Method (1) Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a forward contract under this determination is the total of— (a) the expected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (2) to (8); and (b) the unexpected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (9). (2) To calculate the income or expenditure in relation to a forward contract, you must first nominate a base currency. (3) If the terms of the forward contract provide for the netting off or offsetting of any amounts payable to or by one party to the forward contract with any amounts payable to or by the other party to the forward contract, you must ignore such netting off or offsetting for the purpose of this determination. (4) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a forward contract is the income year in which you become a party to the forward contract, you must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the forward contract as at the time you become a party to the forward contract. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the forward contract. The base currency payments of a forward contract consist of— (a) the base currency value of the payment or receipt, if any, made in consideration of entering into the forward contract; (b) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate; (c) the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate. (5) You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates as at the time you become a party to the forward contract if the base currency is not NZD. 12 (6) The expected NZD net amount is the difference between items (b) and (c) in subparagraph (4), adjusted for any amount as described in item (a). You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (7) You must use the straight-line method to spread the expected NZD net amount of a forward contract that has been written for no consideration at a rate other than the forward rate. (8) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a forward contract is after the income year in which you entered the forward contract, and you have not been required to use Determination G14A for the forward contract, you must follow the method set out in subparagraphs (1) to (7) to calculate gross income or expenditure of the forward contract, except that— (a) the NZD net amount to be spread under subparagraph (6) consists of— (i) actual NZD payments that have occurred since you became a party to the forward contract until the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination; (ii) expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract; and (b) the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the forward contract must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination for the forward contract. (9) The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under subparagraph (5). You need not calculate the unexpected component separately as it is part of the base price adjustment required under whichever is applicable of section EH 4 of the Act and section EH 45 of the Act. Transitional adjustment for existing forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities (10) You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation for the first income year for which you must use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract, if you entered the forward contract before the income year and have not been required to use Determination G14A for the forward contract. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for such forward contract in accordance with the following formula: a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the forward contract 13 b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the forward contract from the time it was entered until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the forward contract c is the sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the first income year for which you must use this determination. 7. Examples (1) A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy 1 million US dollars (USD) against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. (2) At the time the New Zealand corporate becomes a party to the forward contract, the expected NZD net amount is zero and so the expected component of the gross income or expenditure from the forward contract is zero. The New Zealand corporate will recognise the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure from the forward contract when performing the base price adjustment under section EH 47 of the Act. Further examples are provided in the schedule. Signed on the 3 rd day of June 2004. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy 14 Schedule: Further examples Note: In each example involving a base price adjustment, the base price adjustment is calculated on the assumption that the forward contract is subject to Division 2 of Part EH of the Act. The details of the calculation would differ for a forward contract that was subject to Division 1 of Part EH of the Act. For the purpose of examples A to C assume that the spot rates and the forward rates for USD/NZD on the relevant dates are as follows: Date Actual Spot CIP: Fwd (0,t) CIP: Fwd (1,t) CIP: Fwd (2,t) Expected US,I Expected NZ,I 30-Apr-04 0.6350 0.6350 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-05 0.6149 0.6230 0.6149 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-06 0.5750 0.6113 0.6033 0.5750 0.04 0.06 30-Apr-07 0.5570 0.5997 0.5919 0.5642 0.04 0.06 The forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP) using the expected interest rates in the United States of America (US,I) and the expected domestic interest rates (NZ,I). Fwd (0,t) represents the forward rates at 30 April 2004 out to period t, while Fwd (1,t) and Fwd (2,t) represent the forward rates at 30 April 2005 and 30 April 2006, respectively, out to period t. For convenience in these examples when calculating the base price adjustment, the same buy/sell spot rates have been used at date of delivery. In practice this would not normally be the case. Example A: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,689,475. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 The expected base currency payments in relation to the forward contract consist of— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,689,475. Since the forward contract was entered into at the forward rate for no consideration, the expected NZD net amount is nil. So there is no expected component to be spread under the accrual rules. 15 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,689,475 = 1,795,332 − 1,689,475 = NZD $105,857 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $105,857 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $105,857 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example B: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 3 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2004 for no consideration and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. Assume that the New Zealand corporate has not been using Determination G14A and has been using an alternative method to calculate the income or expenditure of the forward contract in the 2003–04 income year. In fact, the corporate has recognised NZD $32,982 as gross income in respect of the forward contract for the year ending 30 June 2004. However, the corporate has elected to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years. Further, assume that the forward rate on 30 June 2005 out to 30 April 2007, the delivery date of the forward contract, is 0.5919. Therefore, the market rate for the delivery of USD $1,000,000 on 30 April 2007 is NZD $1,689,475. Given the contract rate of 0.5997 for the delivery of USD $1,000,000, there is an expected NZD net amount of NZD $22,059. Using this determination, the expected NZD net amount should be spread on a straight line basis over the term of the forward contract. 16 The transitional adjustment in the 2004–05 income year – 30 June 2005 Using a straight line method to spread the expected NZD net amount of NZD $22,059, the gross income in relation to the forward contract for the year ending 2004 and 2005 should have been NZD $1,226 and NZD $7,353, respectively. Therefore the transitional adjustment is— a – b – c + d where— a the sum of all amounts that would have been income from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 1,226 + 7,353 = 8,579 b the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure from the time the corporate become a party to the forward contract until the end of the income year = 0 c the sum of all income in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year = 32,982 d the sum of all expenditure in respect of the forward contract since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year =0. The net amount of −NZD $24,403 is gross expenditure in the 2004–05 income year. At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 = 1,795,332 − 1,667,416 = NZD $127,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 32,982 + 7,353 = NZD $40,335 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = NZD $24,403 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 17 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $127,916 − $40,335 + $24,403 + 0 = $111,984 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,984 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example C: Seller of base currency (NZD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate A New Zealand corporate borrower enters into a long-term forward foreign exchange contract to buy USD $1,000,000 against delivery of NZD in 2 years’ time. The contract was entered into on 30 April 2005 and the corporate borrower has a balance date of 30 June. The contract rate is 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD, so settlement will require delivery of NZD $1,667,416. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate borrower paid NZD $10,000 to enter into this forward contract. (This could be the same forward contract as in the previous example where the forward contract was sold on 30 April 2005.) The corporate chooses NZD as the base currency for this contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 The forward rate in this case is 0.5919 USD to 1 NZD, which is different from the contract rate of 0.5997 USD to 1 NZD. The expected settlement on the commitment to purchase USD $1,000,000 at 30 April 2007 is, therefore, NZD $1,689,475. The payment made in acquiring the forward contract was NZD $10,000. Thus, the expected base currency payments in this example consist of— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,689,475; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416. So, the expected NZD net amount from the forward contract is NZD $12,059 (i.e. the difference between the commitments under the forward contract measured at the contract rate (NZD $1,667,416) and the commitments under the forward contract measured at the forward rate (NZD $1,689,475) less the payment made to acquire the forward contract). The payments in relation to the forward contract are summarised in the table below. The expected NZD net amount is spread using the yield to maturity method recommended in Determination G3 and allocated to the income year on a daily basis consistent with Determination G1A. 18 Date Expected Cash (NZD) Contract Cash (NZD) Expected Cash (NZD) Expected Income 30-Apr-05 00−10,000 30-Apr-06 0004,852 30-Apr-07 1,689,4751,667,41622,059 7,207 Total 12,05912,059 YTM 49% At the first balance date – 30 June 2005 Expected component = (61/365 × $4,852) = $811. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $811 is gross income at the first balance date. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 Expected component = (61/365 × $7,207) + (304/365 × $4,852) = $1,204 + $4,041 = $5,245. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,245 is gross income at the second balance date. At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 – 10,000 = 1,795,332 − 1,677,416 = NZD $117,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 811 + 5,245 = NZD $6,056 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $117,916 − $6,056 + 0 + 0 = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. 19 Example D: Purchaser of base currency (USD); contract rate is not equal to the market rate Assuming that in the previous example, the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for the forward contract. At the time the contract was entered into – 30 April 2005 Since the base currency is USD, the base currency payments expected at the commencement date is— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = NZD $10,000 × 0.6149 = USD $6,149; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = NZD $1,667,416 × 0.5919 = USD $986,944; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = NZD $1,667,416 × 0.5997 = USD $1,000,000. The expected base currency payments (summarised in column 4 of the table below) are converted into NZD using the relevant forward rates. The expected NZD net amount of NZD $12,057 is then spread over the term of the forward contract using the yield to maturity method recommended in Determination G3 and allocated to the income year on a daily basis consistent with Determination G1A.

Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $811 is gross income at the first balance date. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 Expected component = (61/365 × $7,206) + (304/365 × $4,852) = $1,204 + $4,041 = $5,245. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,245 is gross income at the second balance date. 20 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 1,000,000/0.557 − 1,667,416 − 10,000 = 1,795,332 − 1,677,416 = NZD $117,916 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 811 + 5,245 = NZD $6,056 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $117,916 − $6,056 = $111,860 and since this is positive, the amount of NZD $111,860 is gross income of the New Zealand corporate for the 30 June 2007 income year. Example E: Forward contract to purchase commodity for USD at non-market rate with a corresponding forward contract in foreign exchange in market rate For the purpose of this example, assume that the forward rates for USD/NZD are as summarised in the following table. These forward exchange rates are derived on the principle of covered interest parity (CIP).

For example, the market price for a barrel of crude oil was USD $19.2 per barrel on 30 June 2004 while the forward price out to 30 June 2007 was USD $21 per barrel. 21 Date Actual Spot Fwd (0,t) Fwd (1,t) Fwd (2,t) 30-Jun-04 19.2 19.2000 30-Jun-05 19.6 20.2000 19.6000 30-Jun-06 21.1 21.8000 22.1000 21.1000 30-Jun-07 22 21.0000 22.8000 22.1000 A New Zealand company enters into 2 forward contracts simultaneously on 30 June 2004. The first forward contract secures the supply of 10,000 barrels of crude oil. This forward contract is to be cash settled on 30 June 2007, at USD $20 per barrel. The second forward contract was entered into for the purchase of USD $200,000 in exchange for the delivery of NZD at a contract rate of 0.5997. The second forward contract is to be settled on 30 June 2007. For the purpose of this example assume that the corporate chooses USD as the base currency for both contracts. At the time the forward contracts were entered into – 30 June 2004 The forward contract for the supply of crude oil was entered into at a price below the market rate. (This may be because the supplier is expecting excess supplies that have not been factored into the market prices yet.) The contract rate of $20 is lower than the forward rate of $21. As a result, gains are expected from the forward contract. The expected base currency payments include— • the base currency value of the payment or receipt made in consideration of entering into the forward contract = 0; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the forward rate = 10,000 × $21 = USD $210,000; • the base currency value of the non-base currency payment to be made under the contract valued at the contract rate = 10,000 × $20 = USD $200,000. The expected base currency payments are converted at the forward rate of 0.5997 USD/NZD and the expected NZD net amount is spread under the accrual rules over the term of the forward contract. As the company did not pay anything to enter into the forward contract, the gains cannot be spread using the yield to maturity method. Therefore, the straight-line method will be adopted to spread the expected gains. The forward contract for the foreign exchange was entered into at the forward rate. As such, there are no expected gains or losses to be spread under the accrual rules (see Example A). At the first and second balance date – 30 June 2005 and 30 June 2006 For the forward contract for crude oil— Expected component = 1/3 ($10,000/0.5997) = $5,558. Unexpected component = 0. The amount of $5,558 is gross income at the first and second balance date. 22 At the final balance date – 30 June 2007 On the 30 June 2007 balance date, the forward contract for the supply of crude oil would have been cash settled at the contract price of USD $20 per barrel. The market price per barrel of crude oil on the delivery date is USD $22. The spot exchange rate on the delivery date is 0.557 USD/NZD. The base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act in relation to the forward contract for the supply of crude oil is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 220,000/0.557 − 200,000/0.557 = 394,973 − 359,066 = NZD $35,807 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 5,558 + 5,558 = NZD $11,116 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. Therefore, the base price adjustment = $35,807 − $11,116 = $24,791 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2007 income year. The forward contract for the foreign exchange is also settled on 30 June 2007. In the 30 June 2007 income year, the base price adjustment given in section EH 47 of the Act is calculated by applying the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 200,000/0.557 − 200,000/0.5997 = 359,066 − 333,500 = NZD $25,566 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 23 Therefore, the base price adjustment = $25,566 and since this is positive, the amount is gross income of the New Zealand company for the 30 June 2007 income year.

Where a person might otherwise be allowed a deduction for the same expenditure twice in successive income years due to a decision to take advantage or to cease to take advantage of this determination, section 106(1)(o) of the Act provides that the later of the supposed deductions is not to be allowed. 4. Where a partnership comprises only persons to whom this determination applies, this determination shall apply to the partnership. 5. Clause 3(2) of this determination has been inserted for the avoidance of doubt on the position of trustees. 6. Use of this determination is optional. No notice is required whether the determination is used or not. 7. Holders of financial arrangements to which the small debtor is the other party must account for income or expenditure for that financial arrangement in accordance with section 64B to 64M of the Act. 2 Reference This determination is made under section 64C(6) of the Act. G15 30 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Scope of Determination 1. This determination shall apply to— (a) Any natural person in every income year in relation to which the person is a qualifying small debtor; and (b) Any partnership in every income year in which the partnership comprises only persons who are qualifying small debtors in relation to the income year. 2. This determination shall not apply to any trustee. 4 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M; “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Qualifying small debtor” in relation to an income year means a natural person— (a) The total value of whose liabilities under specified financial arrangements is not more than $200,000 at the end of the income year; and (b) Who— (i) Is a cash basis holder in respect of all financial arrangements held by the person at the end of the income year (other than financial arrangements of any class dealt with by the Commissioner in terms of section 64D(2)(b) of the Act); or (ii) Holds no financial arrangements at the end of the income year: “Specified financial arrangement” means a financial arrangement (whether entered into before or after the implementation date for such class of financial arrangement), interest payable on which is deductible, or on which interest would be deductible if it were payable, pursuant to section 106(1)(h) of the Act in calculating the assessable income of the person in the income year; “Total value” of a person’s liabilities under specified financial arrangements at any time means the amount required to satisfy all those financial arrangements at that time, G15 30 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] disregarding any penalty to be suffered by the person or any benefit to which the person is entitiled for early repayment. 2. For the purposes of this determination, financial arrangements issued by a partnership shall be treated as separate financial arrangements issued by each partner to the extent of the partner’s liability (as agreed between the partners) in respect of financial arrangements issued by the partnership, and any payment made or expenditure incurred by the partnership in relation to the financial arrangement issued by the partnership shall, for the purpose of this determination, be treated as having been paid or incurred by each partner in proportion of such liability. 5 Exemption 1. A person who, in relation to an income year, is a qualifying small debtor shall not be required to comply with the requirements of section 64C(2), (3) and (4) of the Act in relation to expenditure incurred in respect of any financial arrangement in the income year: Provided that this exemption shall not apply to any financial arrangement— (a) Where the qualifying small debtor would, if section 64C was not applicable, incur expenditure in relation to the financial arrangement and a period ending more than three months after the end of the income year, other than fees that relate to the commencement of the financial arrangement and do not exceed 2% of the amount of the consideration provided to the person in relation to the financial arrangement before the end of the income year; (b) Of any class dealt with by the Commissioner in terms of section 64D(2)(b) of the Act. 2.

On 15 March 1990 a loan company advances $10,000, repayable on 15 September 1991, to natural person X for business related purposes. In addition X owes $250,000 on money borrowed to purchase a private residence, interest on which is not deductible in the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. X is also a cash basis holder, as defined in section 64D of the Act. X has no other liabilities thus total debts for business purposes are less than $200,000. There is a $100 processing fee, paid at commencement, and fixed interest of 20% p.a. is payable half-yearly in arrears. 2. At income year-end 31 March 1990, X is a qualifying small debtor and chooses to take advantage of this determination. X claims only the $100 fee as a deductible expense, notwithstanding that interest has accrued under the financial arrangement. At 31 March 1991, X has retained his or her status as a qualifying small debtor and claims the interest due and paid on 15 September 1990 and 15 March 1991 — a total of $2000. 3. On repayment of the loan in September 1991, the base price adjustment as defined in section 64F(2) of the Act is applied by X: a the amount of all consideration paid by the borrower: $13,000 b the acquisition price of the facility: $10,000 c expenditure incurred under section 64C: $100 + $2,000 = $2,100 Hence: a − (b + c) = $13,100 − (10,000 + 2,100) = $1,000 deemed expenditure G15 30 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] EXAMPLE B: INTEREST PAYABLE IN ADVANCE 1. The loan conditions specified in Example A above apply, except that interest is payable in advance (on 15 March 1990, 15 September 1990, and 15 March 1991). Hence, although the person X is a qualifying small debtor as at 31 March 1990 and 31 March 1991, the financial arrangement is not exempt because more than three months interest has been prepaid. 2. Expenditure in respect of the $10,000 advance for the income years ended 31 March 1990 and 1991 must be calculated pursuant to section 64C(2) of the Act. On repayment of the loan in 1991 the base price adjustment is applied. 3. Person X takes out a further loan of $15,000 where interest is payable six monthly in arrears. The second loan does qualify for the exemption because the total value of X’s liabilities for business purposes is less than $200,000 and interest is not prepaid on this loan. EXAMPLE C: PARTNERSHIP 1. Natural persons A, B, and C are business partners in ABC which has a 31 December income year. On 31 October 1991 the partnership enters into an agreement to borrow $500,000 for business purposes. The partners are jointly and severally liable under the financial arrangement, but they have agreed that they share liability under the financial arrangement as between themselves in the same ratio as their shares of partnership income: A is entitled to fifty percent of the partnership income; B and C share the remaining fifty percent equally. The loan is for a six month term, and carries interest at 15 percent payable in quarterly instalments on 30 January and 30 April. B and C are cash basis holders, and each of them has other business-related debts amounting to less than $25,000. As A is not a qualifying debtor, the partnership is outside the scope of this determination. 2. On 31 March 1992, B and C are qualifying small debtors, in that their respective liabilities under financial arrangements are less than $200,000. However, the exemption from complying with the requirements of section 64C of the Act only applies for B and C’s business-related financial arrangements other than their share in ABC. In the 1992 income year, the partnership is obliged to apply the accrual tax accounting rules to the partnership financial agreement to borrow $500,000. G15 30 May 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3. The loan details in paragraph (1) above apply except that partners A, B, and C have agreed that they share liability under the financial arrangement equally, and A is a cash basis holder. As all partners in ABC are qualifying small debtors, the partnership can account for partnership liabilities under this determination. EXAMPLE D: PRIVATE & DOMESTIC LIABILITIES NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT S, a natural person, has a mortgage of $400,000 on his or her principal residence for private purposes. In the 1990 income year, S enters into a $100,000 second mortgage on the same property for business purposes. Interest is payable monthly in advance. S is the issuer of no other business financial arrangements. At year-end, S is a cash basis holder and borrowings for business purposes total less than $200,000. The terms of the second mortgage qualify the loan as a specified financial arrangement. Person S may therefore elect to apply this determination, and not comply with section 64C at the end of the 1990 income year-end in respect of the loan. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency Issued: 9 February 1990 G16A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G16A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency”. G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency made by the Commissioner on 10 July 1989. This determination differs from Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency by— (a) Requiring that the interest rate used to determine the discounted value of amounts payable in relation to a trade credit be ascertained as at the supply date of the specified goods or services rather than as at the date of entry into the trade credit (which can be difficult to determine); and (b) Requiring the discounted value of the amounts payable to be used to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred in an income year (which is an extension made to the method for completeness). 2. This determination provides the method to be used to calculate the core acquisition price for a trade credit under section 64BA(1)(b)(iii) of the Act where— (a) The trade credit is not a short term trade credit; and (b) The amounts payable in respect of the trade credit are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (c) In relation to the trade credit all amounts payable and the dates on which they are payable are known at the first balance date after supply date; and (d) The term of the trade credit is known at the first balance date after supply date. 3. A short term trade credit, where payment is required within 63 days after supply of the specified goods or services, is exempted from the scope of the accrual provisions by the definitions in section 64B(1) of the Act. 4. Any other trade credit is subject to the accrual provisions of the Act and relevant determinations. In such cases the core acquisition price must be determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. 5. Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define acquisition price in terms of the core acquisition price, which is itself defined in section 64BA(1). Paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii) of that section provide two ways of determining the amount “u” which is required for calculating the core acquisition price. Where neither of these apply, paragraph (b)(iii) provides that “u” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] specified goods or services, as determined pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. 6. This determination requires an interest rate to be ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields, as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. This interest rate is the market yield applying to bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit; if the term of the trade credit is longer than twelve months the market yield on New Zealand Government securities must be used. 7. The amounts payable are then discounted to the supply date using the yield so ascertained and the present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. The present value so calculated is the amount of “u” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. 8. The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. 9. Once the acquisition price is known, income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit, shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method which could be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or an alternative method producing a result that is not materially different. The acquisition price is also required for the base price adjustment. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this determination is signed. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to every trade credit denominated in New Zealand currency in relation to which a person is a holder or an issuer, but it shall not apply— (a) To a short term trade credit; or G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) To a trade credit to which paragraph (b)(i) or paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “core acquisition price” in section 64BA(1) of the Act applies; or (c) Where in relation to the trade credit any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after supply date; or (d) Where the term of the trade credit is not known at the first balance date after supply date. 4 Principle 1. The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified goods or services is calculated as at the supply date using— (a) The market yield to maturity available on traded debt securities of a similar term to the term of the trade credit, ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; and (b) Present value calculation Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 2. The discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services enables the acquisition price of a trade credit to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. 3. The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the trade credit in any income year, and where the discounted value and the amount of future payments under the trade credit are known the yield to maturity method is to be applied. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denominated in New Zealand currency to pay and drawn upon, and accepted by— (a) A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b) Any person referred to in part A of the first schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Final payment” in relation to a trade credit means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of the trade credit under the trade credit, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total consideration required to be given by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Paid”, in relation to any amount paid to or paid by any person, includes distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interests of or on behalf of or to the order of the person; and, in relation to any amount, “pay”, “payable” and “payment” have corresponding meanings: “Specified goods and services” in relation to a trade credit means the goods and services to which the trade credit relates: “Supply date” means the day on which the specified goods or services are supplied under the trade credit: “Term” in relation to a trade credit means the period commencing on the day after the supply date and ending on the day on which final payment is required to be made. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6 Method 1. For the purposes of subparagraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services in relation to any person shall be the present value as at supply date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified goods or services after the supply date. 2. For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at supply date of amounts payable shall be calculated, subject to subclause (3) of this clause, using Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] alternative method producing not materially different results. The present value so calculated is the amount “u” to be used to determine the core acquisition price. 3. For the purposes of subclause (2) of this clause the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be— (a) Where the term of the trade credit is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit: (b) In any other case, the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term to the term of the trade credit— determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services and according to Determination G13: Prices or Yields. 4. The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. 5. Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the core acquisition price, and using the yield to maturity method. 7 Example 1. A trade credit is entered into on 1 December 1988. Under the trade credit, goods supplied on 17 February 1989 are to be paid by $400,000 in New Zealand currency on 14 July 1989. The term of the trade credit (period from day after supply date to final payment date) is therefore 147 days. 2. The market yield on 17 February 1989 of bank bills maturing in 147 days is 13.5% ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. 3. In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. 4. The purchaser has a 31 March balance date. 5. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows— G16A 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This is “u” to be used in calculating the core acquisition price. 6. For purposes of recognising income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the trade credit Determination G3 is used (alternatively, G11 could be used) where— R = 13.5% N = 2.48299, and F = 0.5437. The expenditure incurred for the 147 day period is, $379,373 × 0.05437 = $20,627 This is apportioned for the period 17 February to 31 March using Determination G1A— Expenditure for the 1990 income year is determined using the base price adjustment where, a = $400,000 b = $379,373 c = $5,893 a − (b + c) = $14,734 As this amount is positive it is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the issuer.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency Issued: 28 May 1992 G17B This Determination may be cited as “Determination G17B: Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency”. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G17A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency made by the Commissioner on 9 February 1990. This determination differs from Determination G17A: (a) By expanding the scope of the determination to ensure the acquisition price, for the purposes of the base price adjustment, must be determined in all circumstances; (b) Making it clear that if all the amounts payable and the dates on which those amounts are payable are known at the first balance date after the transfer date the yield to maturity method must be applied to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of the deferred property settlement; (c) Providing a method of calculating income derived or expenditure incurred during the term of a deferred property settlement where the amounts payable or the dates on which those amounts are payable are not known with certainty at the first balance date after the transfer date; and (d) In the use of the specified rate. This determination uses the method prescribed in Determination G23: Specified Rate. Determination G17A used the market yield ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. 2. In this determination an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option, where payment in full is not made at the time at which the first right in the specified property is to be transferred, will be called a “Deferred Property Settlement”. 3. This determination does not apply— (a) To short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (b) To short term options; or (c) To private or domestic agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (d) To deferred property settlements where any amount payable is denominated in foreign currency; or (e) To deferred property settlements where the total deposits and other amounts payable more than 31 days prior to the transfer date exceed 20% of the total purchase price. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. Short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property and short term options are agreements or options under which settlement is required within— (a) 93 days of entry into the contract in the case of real property; or (b) 63 days of entry into the contract in the case of other property. Such short term agreements or options are excepted from the accruals provisions of the Act. A private or domestic agreement for the sale and purchase of property as defined in section 64B(1) is also an excepted financial arrangement. 5. For all deferred property settlements, a core acquisition price must be determined as at the date on which the first right in the property is transferred; for ease of reference, this date is called the “transfer date” in this determination. Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define “acquisition price” in terms of the “core acquisition price”, which is itself defined in section 64BA(1). In section 64BA(1)(c)(i) an amount “w” is defined as the lowest price that the buyer and seller would have agreed upon for the property on the basis of payment in full at the time at which the first right in the specified property is to be transferred. If there is no such lowest price, then paragraph (c)(ii) provides that “w” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property as determined pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. 6. As indicated in subclause 1(1) above, this determination requires the discounted value of the amounts payable to be calculated at an interest rate ascertained in accordance with Determination G23: Specified Rate, as at the transfer date of the specified property. The specified rate is the market yield applying to bank bills of a similar term to the credit term; if the credit term is longer than twelve months the market yield on New Zealand Government securities must be used. 7. The amounts payable are then discounted to the transfer date, using the yield so ascertained and the present value calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. The sum of the discounted amounts and any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount of “w” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. 8. The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. 9. Once the acquisition price is known, income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement, shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property was equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method which could be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Maturity Method or Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or an alternative method producing a result which is not materially different. 10. For the purposes of determining the income derived or expenditure incurred of a deferred property settlement the yield to maturity method (or an alternative method producing not materially different results) will not apply: (a) Where in relation to the deferred property settlement any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after transfer date; or (b) Where the credit term of the deferred property settlement is not known at the date of entry into the Deferred Property Settlement. 11. Where the yield to maturity method can not be applied as the amounts payable or the dates on which those amounts are payable are not known the “best estimate method” of determining income derived or expenditure incurred is to be used. The method requires each party to the arrangement to estimate the unknown variables (the credit term or the amounts payable or dates on which amounts are payable) in relation to the deferred property settlement. The estimates should be fair and reasonable given the facts known in relation to the arrangement. The discounted value of the amounts estimated may be used as the basis for a yield to maturity accrual to determine income derived or expenditure incurred over the term of the Deferred Property Settlement. 12. If estimates of the credit term of cash flows or the dates on which amounts are payable change an adjustment must be made using the method specified in Determination G26: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement in the income year in which the change occurs. That method requires an adjustment to be made in the year the estimates change. The effect of the adjustment is that the total income or expenditure up to the end of the year in which the estimates change is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the new estimates been known at the first balance date after the transfer date. The adjustment must be made on the basis of fair and reasonable re-estimates of the unknown variables, which re-estimates are required to be undertaken by the parties for these purposes at the end of any year when actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances have rendered the original estimate (or previous re-estimate) no longer fair and reasonable. 13. Where any party to a deferred property settlement fails to undertake any such estimate or re-estimate or to communicate such estimate or re-estimate to the Commissioner in the income tax return for the relevant year, or where any party adopts an estimate or G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] re-estimate which is in the Commissioner's opinion not or no longer fair and reasonable, the Commissioner shall determine his own estimates and the method below shall be applied. Such estimates or re-estimates by the Commissioner may also be subject to change, so as to reflect different actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances, in the manner contemplated in subclause 1(12) and this subclause 1(13) of this determination. 14. When settlement takes place the acquisition price should be recalculated using the discounting provisions of this determination for the purposes of the base price adjustment. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. Determination G17A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to a Deferred Property Settlement Denominated in New Zealand Currency is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this determination is signed. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to any deferred property settlement in relation to which a person is a holder or issuer, but shall not apply— (a) To any Deferred Property Settlement where any amount payable (other than the property that is the subject of the Deferred Property Settlement) is not denominated in New Zealand dollars; or (b) To any Deferred Property Settlement where more than 20% of the amounts payable is required to be paid more than 31 days prior to the transfer date. 4 Principle 1. The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified property is calculated as at the transfer date using— (a) The Specified Rate; and G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) Present value calculation Method A provided in subclause 6(2) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 2. The discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property enables the acquisition price for a deferred property settlement to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. 3. Where any amounts payable or the dates on which any amounts are payable are not known with certainty reasonable estimates of the unknown variables must be made to enable an estimate of income derived or expenditure incurred in any income year. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Bank Bill” means an order to Pay, denominated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by a person who is a registered bank for the purposes of the Reserve Bank Act, 1989: “Credit Term” means the period commencing on the day after the transfer date and ending on the day on which the final payment is required to be made: “Deferred Property Settlement” means an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option under which any amount is payable after the date on which the first right in the specified property is transferred: “Final Payment” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of a deferred property settlement under the agreement, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total value of consideration required to be given by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Paid”, in relation to any amount paid to or paid by any person, includes distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interests of or on behalf of or to the order of the person; and, in relation to any amount, “pay”, “payable” and “payment” have corresponding meanings: G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Specified Property” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the property that is the subject of the deferred property settlement: “Specified Rate” at any date shall be calculated pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate: “Transfer Date” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the day on which the first right in the specified property is transferred. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 3. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method Calculating the Acquisition Price for the Base Price Adjustment 1. For the purposes of subparagraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in section 64BA(1)(c) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property in relation to any person shall be calculated by summing— (a) Every amount payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified property on or before the transfer date; and (b) The present value as at the transfer date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified property after the transfer date. Where the amounts payable and the dates those amounts are payable are not known at the first balance date after the transfer date, the acquisition price shall be calculated for the purposes of the base price adjustment when the financial arrangement matures. 2. For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at the transfer date of the amounts payable shall be calculated, subject to subclause (3) of this clause, using Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 3. For the purposes of subclause (2) of this clause the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be the specified rate determined as at the transfer date of the specified property and according to Determination G23: Specified Rate. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4. The present value of the amounts payable together with any deposit or amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisition price in accordance with section 64BA(1) of the Act. 5. The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. The acquisition price used will be used as variable “b” of the base price adjustment. Calculating the Present Value of the Amounts Payable for the Purposes of Determining Income Derived or Expenditure Incurred during the Term of a Deferred Property Settlement 6. Where the amounts payable and the dates on which those amounts are payable are known by the first balance date after the transfer date the income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property were equal to the core acquisition price calculated in accordance with the Act and subclauses (1) to (5) of this clause using the yield to maturity method or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 7. Where the amounts payable and the dates on which those amounts are payable are not known by the first balance date after the transfer date fair and reasonable estimates of the amounts payable and the dates on which those amounts are payable are to be used for the purposes of calculating the core acquisition price. The income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property were equal to the core acquisition price calculated in accordance with the Act and subclauses (1) to (5) of this clause, using the yield to maturity method or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 8. If estimates of the credit term or amounts payable or receivable or the dates on which amounts are payable or receivable change an adjustment must be made using the method specified in Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement in the income year in which the change occurs. That method requires an adjustment to be made in the year the estimates change. The effect of the adjustment is that the total income or expenditure up to the end of the year in which the estimates change is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the new estimates been known at the first balance date after the transfer date. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 9. Where any party to a deferred property settlement fails to undertake any such estimate or re-estimate or to communicate such estimate or re-estimate to the Commissioner in the income tax return for the relevant year, or where any party adopts an estimate or re-estimate which is in the Commissioner’s opinion not or no longer fair and reasonable, the Commissioner may determine his own estimates or re-estimates and the method used in this determination shall be applied. Such estimates or re-estimates by the Commissioner may also be subject to change, so as to reflect different actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances, in the manner contemplated in subclause 6(8) and this subclause 6(9) of this determination. 7 Examples 1. A commercial property is sold for $1,500,000 under a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain planning consents being obtained. A deposit of $150,000 is paid on 20 December 1988, when the agreement is entered into. The balance of $1,350,000 is payable in two equal instalments due 3 and 6 months after the date of possession. Under the agreement, possession passes to the purchaser on the date the sale becomes unconditional; the purchaser has no other prior rights. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. On 3 March 1989 the planning consents are obtained and the sale becomes unconditional. The Credit Term of the agreement (3 March 1989 to 4 September 1989) is 185 days (or 2 quarters). As this is under twelve months the yield on bank bills must be ascertained. The yield on bank bills of a similar term to the credit term ascertained on 20 December 1988 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate, is 13.2%. In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 3 March 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows— G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] At 3 March 1989: A = $653,437 B = $675,000 C = 0 To this must be added the $150,000 deposit, giving a total present value of $1,435,999 which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisition price. For the purposes of recognising the expenditure incurred in the 1989 and 1990 income years Determination G3 is used (alternatively, G11A could be used), where— R = 13.2% N = 4 F = 0.0330 The expenditure incurred for the first 3 months is— $1,285,999 × 0.0330 = $42,437.96 G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This expenditure is allocated to the 1989 income year in accordance with Determination G1A— 1989 income year − 28 days = $12,915.90 On the maturity of the financial arrangement, in the 1990 income year, a base price adjustment is calculated to arrive at the income deemed to be incurred. Base Price Adjustment = a − (b + c) where— a = all consideration paid = $1,500,000 b = the acquisition price = $1,435,999 c = expenditure incurred in previous income years = $12,915.90 bpa = $51,085.10 which is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1990 income year. As this is a positive amount it is deemed to be income derived by the holder in that income year. 2. An agreement for the sale and purchase of a rural property (which is to be subdivided) was entered into on 10 September 1990. The terms of the agreement are: Price: $525,000 (including the deposit) Deposit: $25,000 paid on 10 September 1990 Possession: 1 February 1991 Settlement: On the later of 1 August 1991 or 14 days after deposit of the subdivision plan in the land office The lowest price, at the time the agreement for the sale and purchase of property was entered into on the basis of payment in full on the date the property is transferred, has not been agreed between the parties. This determination requires the buyer and seller to make a fair and reasonable estimate of the anticipated settlement date in order to calculate income or expenditure accruing at balance date. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The acquisition price for the purposes of the base price adjustments will be recalculated if the facts change from those which are estimated. It would be appropriate in this case to expect settlement on 1 August 1991, the last day for settlement under the terms of the agreement for the sale and purchase of property. The appropriate calculations to determine income derived or expenditure incurred for the purchaser are shown below. The purchaser has a 31 March balance date and is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. The Credit Term of the agreement (1 February 1991 to 1 August 1991) is 181 days. As this is under twelve months the yield on bank bills must be ascertained in order to discount the purchase price. The yield on bank bills of a similar term to the credit term on 20 December 1988 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate, is 11.5%. Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 1 February 1991 (“the specified date”) as follows— At 1 February 1991: To this must be added the $25,000 deposit, giving a total present value of $497,813. This amount is used as the basis for an accrual calculation. For the purposes of recognising the expenditure incurred in the 1991 and 1992 income years Determination G3 or Determination G11A or an alternative method producing not materially different results may be used. (Note: As there is only one period of less than a year and no discount or premium a yield to maturity accrual method will G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] produce the same result as spreading the difference between the present value and the total amount payable on a daily basis over the term of the arrangement). The amount allocated to each day in the period is: There are 58 days between 1 February and 31 March therefore expenditure incurred in the 1991 financial year is: $150.20 × 58 = $8,711.60. If settlement occurs as expected on 1 August 1991 a base price adjustment is calculated to determine income derived or expenditure incurred. The acquisition price for the purposes of the base price adjustment will be as calculated above. Base Price Adjustment = a − (b + c) where: a = all consideration paid = $525,000 b = the acquisition price = $497,813 c = expenditure incurred in previous income years = $8,711.60 bpa = $18,475.40, which is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1992 income year. If, however, the settlement date differs from 1 August 1991 the acquisition price for the purposes of the base price adjustment should be recalculated using the method provided in this determination. 3. The assets of a company are sold on a deferred payment basis for a price which is in part to be determined by the profitability of the company over the next 36 months. The terms of the arrangement are as follows: Price: $1,300,000 plus 10% of profits for the next three years Deposit: $100,000 paid on 10 September 1990 Possession: 1 February 1991 Settlement: Half-yearly instalments of $200,000 on 1 August and 1 February plus 10% of profits on 1 February each year. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The cashflows in relation to the arrangement including the profits, forecast (based on previous company data and forecast trends in the business, costs, capital expenditures, etc.) by the buyer, are: The buyer and the seller were unable to agree on a lowest price which is why the percentage of profits option was adopted. An interest element has been capitalised into the cost of sale. The seller (holder) is obliged to return accrual income associated with the transaction. The buyer (issuer) will seek a deduction for accrual expenditure incurred. As the lowest price was not agreed the discounted value method applies. This example looks at the calculations made by the buyer. The Credit Term of the agreement (1 February 1991 to 1 February 1994) is 1,096 days (or 6 half year periods). As this is over twelve months the yield on New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term must be ascertained. The yield on Government Stock of a term similar to the credit term on 1 February 1991 pursuant to Determination G23: Specified Rate is 10.0%. In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer”. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 1 February 1991 (the “specified date”) as follows: G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It will be found that the present value of the cashflows, by continuing to discount as shown above and in accordance with Determination G10B, is $1,192,343 (which figure is arrived at as demonstrated in the table below). This amount is the value of the property for the purposes of a yield to maturity accrual. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The amounts calculated using the yield to maturity method, Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method will be expenditure incurred by the buyer of the property. The results are shown in a table below. These amounts are spread on a daily basis between income years using Determination G1A as follows: This amount can be used as the basis of a yield to maturity accrual. The cashflows and expenditure incurred in each period are: The yield to maturity rate (note that it is assumed no fees or other payments are made in relation to the financial arrangement) is 10.0%. G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Note: The yield to maturity method will enable the calculation of an amount of income or expenditure for the final year to which a financial arrangement relates. However for the purposes of calculating the amount deemed to be income derived or expenditure incurred in the final income year it is necessary to apply section 64F of the Act — the base price adjustment. On 1 February 1993 the profits of the company are $500,000. The buyer therefore pays $50,000 to the purchaser. The buyer’s forecast of future payments remains as originally estimated. The method in Determination G25: Variations to the Terms of a Financial Arrangement is used to calculate expenditure incurred in the period and future income years. That is, if the change cashflows had been known at the beginning of the arrangement the present value would be $1,215,019 and the yield to maturity rate is 10.0%. The cashflows and expenditure incurred in each period are: The amounts would be spread between income years as follows: G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Using the formula in Determination G25 expenditure incurred in the 1993 income year is: Thus, a − b − c + d = −98,911 This amount is expenditure incurred by the issuer in the 1993 income year. If the remaining estimates are accurate the expenditure incurred in the respective income years would be as follows: A party will be required to change an estimate or re-estimate at the end of any year where the actual cashflows and/or factual circumstances are such that the applicable G17B 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] estimate or re-estimate is no longer “fair and reasonable”. In default of any such estimate or re-estimate, the Commissioner may adopt or substitute his own estimates. Thus, if the cashflows change from estimates in the 1994 year to an extent that the re- estimates are no longer fair and reasonable, the method in Determination G25 may again be used to calculate expenditure incurred. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Exchange Traded Option Contracts Issued: 4 December 1989 G19 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts”. G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination is available for persons unable to use section 64C(4). 2. An option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying financial instrument, at a predetermined price at any time during a predetermined future period. For this right the owner of the option has to pay a premium, which is quoted on the exchange in points, to the seller/writer of the option. The owner of the option has the right to exercise the option at any date during the term of the option. The person who has the rights to exercise the option is the grantee of the option while the writer of the option is the grantor. 3. Markets, sources of information, and prices for an option contract are determined by reference to Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets. 4. The income derived or expenditure incurrred in relation to an option contract in an income year is the change in option value, taking account of transaction costs, as determined by the change in price of the option contract obtained in accordance with Clause 6(3) of Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International and Futures and Option Markets. 5. This determination only applies to options traded on markets approved in Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, or Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets. Options outside the accruals regime, for example options on shares, are outside the scope of this determination. 2 Reference This determination is made prusuant to section 64E(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply where it is necessary to calculate the income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in respect of a call option contract or a put option contract, traded on approved markets, to which the person becomes a party after the day on which this determination is signed. G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 Principle 1. An option that is exercised gives rise to a net gain or loss if the value at the exercise date of the underlying asset to which the option relates is different from the exercise price plus the premium. Similarly a net gain or loss will be made where a person closes out at a different price than that paid to acquire the option. A gain or loss will also be made where the option is allowed to lapse. 2. The net gain or loss on an option at balance date is the difference between: (a) The— (i) Purchase price of the option plus transaction costs incurred in acquiring the option, in the case of the person acquiring the option, if the option has been purchased since last balance date; or (ii) Sale price of the option less transaction costs incurred in writing the option, in the case of the writer of the option, if the option has been written since last balance date; or (iii) Net realisable value of the option as on the immediately preceding balance date, where the option contract had not been entered into in that income year; and (b) The net realisable value of the option as at balance date. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires,— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Approved markets” are those markets approved in Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets: “Call options” are an option to buy the underlying financial instrument, which in the case of option contracts approved in Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, will be a futures contract: G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Exchange traded option contract” means an option contract traded on an approved market: “Exercise price” means the price at which the option may be exercised on the underlying futures contract: “Net realisable value” means the market value of the option, as ascertained in accordance with Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: I nternational Futures and Option Markets, less the direct costs associated with closing out, exercising, or lapsing the option. In the case of the writer of the option the net realisable value may be a negative value: “Put options” are an option to sell the underlying financial instrument, which in the case of option contracts approved in Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, will be a futures contract: “Transaction costs” are those direct costs incurred in the purchase or sale of the option including, but not limited to, brokers fees and clearing house fees. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as referring to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind or extend that determination. 6 Method 1. The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of an exchange traded option contract in any income year (other than an income year to which section 64F of the Act applies) is calculated using the following formula: a − b where— a is— (i) In the case of the grantee of the option, the purchase price of the option, plus transaction costs incurred in entering into the option contract, if the option has been acquired in that income year; or (ii) In the case of the grantor of the option, the sale price of the option, less transaction costs incurred in entering into the option contract, if the option was written in that income year, which amount shall be deemed to be a negative value; or G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (iii) The net realisable value of the option as on the immediately preceding balance date, if the option contract had not been entered into in that income year; and b is the net realisable value of the option as balance date. 2. Where the amount calculated using the above formula is a positive amount it shall be deemed to be expenditure incurred in that income year. 3. Where the amount calculated using the above formula is a negative amount it shall be deemed to be income derived in that income year. 7 Examples Example A On 10 July 1989 a taxpayer believes that there will be a rise in interest rates. The taxpayer is not completely certain that this will happen so the taxpayer decides to purchase put options, so as to limit the risk. On that day the futures price for a September 1989 90 Day Bank Bill Contract is 8700. The taxpayer purchases five put options on 90 Day Bank Bill Option Contracts with a strike price of 8700. The option premuims for the five contracts total $2,024.75 (11.57 \[$ value per point\] × 35 \[premium value in points\] = 404.95 \[premium value per contract\] × 5 \[no. of contracts\]). Commission and Clearing House fees for the five contracts total $200. The taxpayer has a 31 July balance date. On that date the price of a 90 Day Bank Accepted Bill Futures Contract has fallen, reflecting a rise in interest rates, to 8625. The value of the five September 8700 put options has risen to $4,628.00, reflecting a 45 point gain in the value of the put options. Transaction costs of closing out the contracts at the present value are $230. Income or expenditure is calculated as follows: Using a − b a = $2,224.75 (2,024.75 + 200) b = $4,398.00 (4,628.00 − 230) Therefore: G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2,224.75 − 4,398.00 = −$2,173.25 which is deemed to be income derived in the 1989 year. Example B On 24 January 1990 a taxpayer believes there will be a drop in interest rates. The taxpayer decides to write put options over 12 Five Year Government Stock Futures Contracts, which were trading at 8750, at an exercise price of 8775. The option premiums for the 12 contracts total $12,531.60 (34.81 \[$ value per point\] × 30 \[premium value in points\] = $1,044.30 \[premium value per contract\] × 12 \[no. of contracts\]). Commission and Clearing House fees for the 12 contracts total $430. The taxpayer has a 28 February balance date. At the close of trading on that day Five Year Government Stock Futures Contracts are trading at 8700, reflecting a rise in interest rates. The value of the twelve March 1990 8775 put options has risen to $30,911.28 reflecting a 44 point loss in the value of the written put options. Transaction costs, if the contracts were closed out, are $420. Income or expenditure is calculated as follows: Example C On 22 May 1989 a taxpayer believes that the Barclays Share Index will increase value over the next few months. The taxpayer decides to purchase 6 call options on September 1989 Barclays Share Index Futures Contracts, which were trading at 1930, at an exercise price of 1950. The option premiums for the 6 contracts total $12,600.00 (20 \[$ value per point\] × 105 \[premium value in points\] = $2,100.00 \[premium value per contract\] × 6 \[no. of contracts\]). Commission and Clearing House fees for the 6 contracts total $210. G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The taxpayer has a 30 June balance date. At the close of trading on that day Barclays Share Index Option Contracts are trading at 1850, reflecting a drop in share values. The value of the six September 1989 1950 call options has fallen to $6,240.00 reflecting a drop in the premium value to $52.00 points. Transaction costs, if the contracts were closed out, are $210. Income or expenditure is calculated as follows: Using a − b a = $12,810.00 (12,600.00 + 210) b = $6,030.00 (6,240.00 − 210) Therefore: 12,810.00 − 6,030.00 = $6,780.00 which is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1989 income year. Example D On 20 December 1989 a taxpayer believes that the New Zealand Dollar is going to fall in value. The taxpayer writes 10 call options over March 1990 New Zealand Dollar Futures Contracts, which are trading at 5600, at an exercise price of 5650. The option premiums for the 10 contracts total $14,300.00 (10 \[$ value per point\] × 143 \[premium value in points\] = $1,430.00 \[premium value per contract\] × 10 \[no. of contracts\]). Commission and Clearing House fees for the 10 contracts total $400. The taxpayer has a 31 December balance date. At the close of trading on the 29th December (last day of trading before balance date) New Zealand Dollar Futures Contracts are trading at 5550, reflecting a drop in the New Zealand Dollar. The value of the ten March 1990 5650 call options has fallen to $11,000.00 reflecting a drop in the point value to $110.00. This is a gain in the value of the written call options. Transaction costs, if the contracts were to be closed out, are $400. Income or expenditure is calculated as follows: G19 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 7 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Note: In the income year in which the option is closed out, lapsed or is exercised a base price adjustment, in terms of section 64F, is required instead of the above calculation.

RESCINDS AND REPLACES  Determination G1: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure, made by the Commissioner on the 13th May 1987 G1A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G1: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure, made by the Commissioner on the 13th May 1987. This determination differs from Determination G1 in the interpretation of a 360 day basis for calculating the number of days between two given dates. 2. This determination requires that income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a period shall be apportioned on a straight line basis among the income years in which the period falls, according to the number of days in the period calculated on either a 365 or a 360 day basis. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to paragraph (a) and (b) of section 64E(1) and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. This determination is required to be applied in circumstances referred to in other determinations. 3. Determination G1: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this Determination G1A is signed. 3 Scope Unless its application is specifically excluded in another determination, this determination applies to all amounts of income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a period where the amount of the income or expenditure has been calculated pursuant to any other determination made pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of section 64E(l) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 4 Principle The apportionment of income and expenditure on a daily straight line basis in respect of a period of not more than one year permits the allocation of income and expenditure to income years within the period on a simple basis. It assumes that income and expenditure accrue at a flat dollar rate over each day in the period. G1A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Interpretation In this determination - a) Unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meanings as in sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976; b) "Period" means the term, not exceeding one year, commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable; c) The number of days in a period calculated on a 365 day basis means the actual number of days in the period including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period; and d) The number of days in a period calculated on a 360 day basis means the number of days falling within the period including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period and calculated as if every calendar month of the period had exactly 30 days; Provided that if the ending date is the 31st day of the month and - i. The starting date of the period is not the 30th or 31st day of a month, the ending date shall be included in the number of days in the period; ii. The starting date of the period is the 30th or 31st day of a month, the ending date shall be deemed to be the 30th day of the month. 6 Method For the purposes of section 64C of the Income Tax Act 1976 the income derived or expenditure incurred by a holder or an issuer of a financial arrangement in respect of a period shall be apportioned among the income years of the holder or issuer in which that period falls pro-rata with the number of days in the period within each income year calculated (at the option of the holder or the issuer) on a 360 or 365 day basis. G1A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 3 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 Example On 29 January 1987 a company issues a 180 day bill for $3,000,000, at a discount of $294,000. The company's balance date is 31 March, and it elects to recognise the interest expense on a 365 day basis. There are 61 days from 29 January to 31 March 1987. Therefore - 61 x $294,000 = $99,633.33 180 This will be brought into account as expenditure in the company's 1986/87 income year, and the balance of $194,366.67 will be brought into account in its 1987/88 income year for income tax purposes pursuant to section 64F of the Income Tax Act 1976. If the company had elected to recognise the interest expense on a 360 day basis, then the number of days from 29 January to 31 March 1987 would have been 62, and amounts of $101,266.67 and $192,733.33 would have been brought into account in its 1986/87 and 1987/88 income years respectively.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Requirements as to Precision Issued: 13 May 1987 G2 This determination may be cited as “Determination G2: Requirements as to Precision” G2 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This Determination sets out the level of precision acceptable in calculations made under other determinations made by the Commissioner pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2 Reference This Determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. It defines the precision acceptable in calculations made under other determinations made by the Commissioner pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope Unless specifically excluded therein, this Determination applies to all other determinations made pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 4 Principle The test for sufficient precision is whether an increase in precision will give a significantly different result in respect of income derived or expenditure incurred in any period to which an amount that is deemed to be income or expenditure is to be allocated. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meanings as in section 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976. 6 Method A calculation is sufficiently precise for the purposes of the application of any determination made under section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 if the income derived or expenditure incurred from a financial arrangement in any period to which an amount that is deemed to G2 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] be income or expenditure is to be allocated would not be changed by more than $5 by the use of greater precision in all intermediate calculations. 7 Example (1) The calculation of the income on the yield to maturity basis for this example is discussed in paragraph 7 of “Determination G3: The Yield to Maturity Method”. A financial arrangement, with a face value of $1,000,000 is purchased for $1,012,500 on 12 March 1987. It bears interest at 7 percent per annum payable semi-annually and is repayable at par on 15 January 1988. The coupon payments are made on 15 May and 15 November each year. Using the yield to maturity method and 1 decimal place gives the accrued income schedule in Table 1 below. Using a yield to maturity of 16.23 percent, on which Table 2 is based, allows the more precise calculation of accrued income. The difference column in Table 2 displays the difference between the calculated accrued income in Table 1 and the calculated accrued income in Table 2. Since some of the net accrued amounts differ by more than $5 more precision is required in the intermediate calculations— G2 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If any one of the differences is greater than $5 it is necessary to repeat the calculation. As this is the case the calculation must be repeated at greater precision. Table 4 demonstrates the results using a yield to maturity of 16.2308%. The differences are all less than $5 compared with Table 3 and would be acceptable for income tax reporting purposes. (2) The calculation of the amounts used in this example are derived from paragraph 7 of “Determination G1: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis”. G2 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] On 29 January 1987 a company issues 180-day bill for an amount of $3,000,000, at a discount of $294,000. The company's balance date is 31 March and it elects under “Determination G1: Apportionment of Income And Expenditure on a Daily Basis” to use a 365 day year. There are 61 days from 29 January to 31 March 1987. As 31 March falls between the issue date and the redemption date it is necessary to apportion the $294,000 expenditure incurred between 2 income years. To do so it is necessary to calculate 61/180 as a proportion. Initial Calculation: 61/180 = 0.3 Amount allocated to income year 1 = .3 × 294,000 = 88,220 Amount allocated to income year 2 = .7 × 294,000 = 205,800 The company is required to do a second calculation using greater precision. Second Calculation: 61/180 = 0.34 Amount allocated to income year 1 = .34 × 294,000 = 99,960 Amount allocated to income year 2 = .66 × 294,000 = 194,040 As the change in expense allocated to each year is greater than $5 it is necessary to increase the precision so the company tries: Third Calculation: 61/180 = 0.339 Amount allocated to income year 1 = .339 × 294,000 = 99,666 Amount allocated to income year 2 = .661 × 294,000 = 194,334 As the change in expense allocated to each income year is still greater than $5 it is still necessary to increase precision: Fourth Calculation: 61/180 = 0.3389 Amount allocated to income year 1 = .3389 × 294,000 = 99,636.60 Amount allocated to income year 2 = .6611 × 294,000 = 194,363.40 The comparison must be repeated again as the difference has not yet reduced to $5 or less: Fifth Calculation: 61/180 = 0.33889 Amount allocated to income year 1 = .33889 × 294,000 = 99,633.66 Amount allocated to income year 2 = .66111 × 294,000 = 194,366.34 G2 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Since the difference is less than $5 it is acceptable to use the ratio .3389 to allocate expenditure to the income year ending on 31 March 1987.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency Issued: 9 February 1990 G20 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency”. G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination provides the method to be used to calculate the core acquisition price for a trade credit under sub-paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act where— (a) Any right or obligation of the parties is expressed in a “base currency” other than New Zealand dollars; and (b) All amounts payable in relation to the trade credit and the dates on which they are payable are known at the first balance date after the supply date; and (c) The term of the trade credit is known at the first balance date after the supply date; and (d) Section 64BA(1)(b)(i), the cash price of the goods or services to which the trade credit relates as determined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981, is not applicable; and (e) Section 64BA(1)(b)(ii), the lowest price at which the specified goods or services could be purchased under a short term trade credit, is not applicable. The core acquisition price is a component of the acquisition price, which is— (i) Required to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred in an income year in accordance with the Income Tax Act 1976 and relevant determinations (and for this purpose the acquisition price must be expressed in the base currency); and (ii) Converted to New Zealand dollars for the purposes of the base price adjustment. 2. A short term trade credit, where payment is required within 63 days after supply of the specified goods or services, is exempted from the scope of the accrual provisions by the definitions in section 64B(1) of the Act. This determination cannot apply to a short term trade credit. 3. Any other trade credit is subject to the accrual provisions of the Act and relevant determinations. Where paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” applies the acquisition price (and therefore the core acquisition price) must be determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. 4. Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define acquisition price in terms of the core acquisition price, which is itself defined in section 64B(1). Paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the definition of “u” in that section provide two ways of determining the amount “u” which is required for calculating the core acquisition price. Where neither of these apply, G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1) provides that “u” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods and services, as determined pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. 5. For these purposes any amount determined in a currency other than New Zealand dollars is required to be discounted using an interest rate appropriate to the currency. This determination allows the use of— (a) A foreign currency interest rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields as at the supply date — this interest rate is the interbank offer rate for the currency and term of the trade credit; or (b) An implied foreign currency interest rate calculated by reference to appropriate forward and spot exchange rates and the New Zealand bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the trade credit. 6. The interest rate appropriate to the term of the trade credit is selected by the taxpayer, and once chosen the rate is required to be used in respect of every income year in which the taxpayer is a holder or an issuer of the trade credit. 7. The amounts payable under the trade credit are discounted to the supply date using the interest rate so ascertained and present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 8. The discounted value of the amounts payable is the amount “u” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. 9. The core acquisition price is used to determine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. 10. Once the acquisition price is known in the base currency, income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated, as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price, using the yield to maturity method, and Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. The yield to maturity method chosen may be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity method or an alternative method producing a result that is not materially different. 11. For purposes of the base price adjustment as defined in section 64F, the acquisition price must be converted to New Zealand dollars on the supply date of the specified goods or services. G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a) and 64E(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to every trade credit where any amount payable is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, but it shall not apply— (a) To a trade credit to which paragraph (b)(i) or paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “core acquisition price” in section 64B(1) of the Act applies; or (b) Where in relation to the trade credit any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after supply date; or (c) Where the term of the trade credit is not known at the first balance date after the supply date. 4 Principle 1. The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified goods or services is calculated— (a) In the base currency as if it were New Zealand currency; (b) Using an interest rate appropriate for the currency, the rate being either— (i ) A rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields that is the foreign interbank offer rate appropriate to the term of the trade credit; or (ii) A rate calculated by reference to appropriate spot and forward exchange rates and the bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the trade credit; and (c) Using present value calculation Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 2. The discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services enables the acquisition price of a trade credit to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] adjustment. For the latter purpose the discounted value of the amounts payable is converted to New Zealand dollars on the supply date of the specified goods or services. 3. The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the trade credit in any income year, and where the discounted value and the amount of future payments under the trade credit are known the yield to maturity method is to be applied. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Acceptable present value calculation method” means Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denominated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by— (a) A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b) Any person referred to in part A of the first schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Base currency” in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed: “Currency” includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement: “Final payment” in relation to a trade credit means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of the trade credit under the trade credit, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total consideration required to be provided by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Forward exchange rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery at a specified future time: G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Interbank offer rate” in relation to a term means the rate at which a bank makes funds available to another bank which is a highly reliable credit risk and a trader in the market for such funds and for such a term; and includes, according to the circumstance, the rates collectively referred to as “LIBOR” and “SIBOR”: “Specified goods and services” in relation to a trade credit means the goods and services to which the trade credit relates: “Spot rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery in 2 days: “Supply date” means the day on which the specified goods or services are supplied: “Term” in relation to a trade credit means the period commencing on and including the day after the supply date and ending on and including the day on which the final payment is required to be made. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6 Method 1. For the purpose of paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services in relation to any person shall be the amount of New Zealand dollars equal in value to the present value as at the supply date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified goods or services after the supply date. 2. For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at supply date of amounts payable shall be calculated, using the interest rate determined under subclause (3)(a), or (b), or clause (4), as appropriate, and an acceptable present value calculation method. The present value so calculated is the amount “u” to be used to determine the core acquisition price. 3. In the first income year in which a person is a party to and derives income or incurs expenditure in respect of a trade credit, the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be, at the option of the person, either— (a) The interbank offer rate for the base currency and the term of the trade credit at supply date of the specified goods or services, being a market yield determined in a manner consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; or G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) A rate derived by— (i) Converting the amount of the final payment from the base currency to New Zealand currency at the forward exchange rate for a term similar to the term of the trade credit and ascertained as at the supply date of the specified goods or services; and (ii) Calculating the present value of the amount thus calculated, using an acceptable present value calculation method and— (A) Where the term of the trade credit is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit; (B) In any other case the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term to the term of the trade credit— the rate being determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services and determined according to Determination G13: Prices or Yields; and (iii) Converting the amount thus calculated to the base currency at the spot rate for the currency on the supply date of the specified goods or services; and (iv) Calculating the base currency interest rate R for the purposes of applying Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods such that, if the said Method A were applied to the final payment over the term of the trade credit, the present value so calculated would be equal to the amount calculated in sub-paragraph (iii) of this paragraph— and for this purpose the exchange rate and the forward exchange rate are to be determined in accordance with Determination G6A: Foreign Exchange Rates— and in all subsequent income years during the term of the trade credit the annual rate of interest for that purpose in respect of the trade credit shall be the rate first used in respect of the trade credit pursuant to this sub-clause. 4. Where an amount payable is expressed in a foreign currency and is required to be converted to New Zealand dollars Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates shall be used. If the base currency is not approved in Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, a spot rate at which an arm's length dealing would be expected to take place at the supply date shall be used. 5. The core acquisition price shall be used to determine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act. G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method and Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. For this calculation the acquisition price shall be expressed in the base currency. 7. For the purposes of the base price adjustment, the acquisition price of the trade credit shall be converted to New Zealand dollars at the spot rate as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. 7 Example A. Calculation where foreign interbank interest rate A trade credit is entered into on 1 December 1988. Under the trade credit, goods supplied on 17 February 1989 are to be paid by $400,000 USD on 14 July 1989. The term of the trade credit (period from day after supply date to final payment date) is therefore 147 days. For the purposes of calculating income derived or expenditure incurred and the base price adjustment it is necessary to calculate the core acquisition price. The US dollar interbank offer rate (LIBOR or SIBOR) on 17 February 1989 for 147 days is 9.625% ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. Foreign currency spot rates ascertained in accordance with Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, for various dates are: 17 February 1989 0.6300 31 March 1989 0.6250 14 July 1989 0.6400 In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows— G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This is converted into NZD at supply date using the spot rate of USD/NZD .6300 = NZ$611,227 and is the amount “u” for the purposes of calculating the core acquisition price. For purposes of recognizing income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the trade credit Determination G3 is used, where R = 9.625%, N = 2.48299, and F = 0.038763 and the acquisition price is US$385,073. The expense for the period 17 February to 14 July is therefore US$400,000 − $385,073 = US$14,927. This is apportioned between periods using Determination G1A as follows: 1988/89 42 days US$ 4,265 1989/90 105 days US$10,662 At balance date the expense for the period must be revalued to reflect exchange rate movements and subsequent gains or losses on the transaction using Determination G9A. Closing tax book value is a = e + f + g − h − i where, e = 0 f = 0 g = 0 h = US$385,073 (the acquisition price) i = US$4,265 (expense incurred during year) Closing tax book value (CTBV) is therefore −US$389,338 Expenditure for the year is calculated in New Zealand dollars using the formula in Determination G9A of a + b − c − d where, G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a = NZ$622,941 (CTBV/spot rate at balance date) b = NZ$611,227 (acquisition price/opening spot rate) c = 0 d = 0 As the result is negative it is deemed to be expenditure incurred of NZ$11,714. At the end of the financial arrangement on the 14 July 1989 the base price adjustment a − (b + c) is calculated where, a = total consideration paid by issuer = total amount of credit/closing spot rate = NZ$625,000 (US$400,000/0.6400) b = acquisition price/opening spot rate = NZ$611,227 c = total expenditure incurred previous year = $11,714 bpa = NZ$2,059 As this is positive it is expenditure incurred in the 1990 income year. Total expenditure claimed in relation to the credit is: NZ$ (11,714 + 2,059) = NZ$13,773 B. Calculation of interest rate where foreign interbank interest rate is not used The purchaser must calculate an implied foreign interest rate by the steps below. Convert payment US$400,000 using FWD Rate to NZ dollars. Forward rate ascertained 17 February 1989 in regard payment in 147 days is USD/NZD .6200. $400,000/.6200 = NZ$645,161. Assume that the yield for NZ bank bills of a 147 day term is 13.5% p.a., ascertained at 17 February 1989 in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. Foreign currency spot rate ascertained in accordance with Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, as at 17 February 1989 is USD/NZD .6300. G20 9 February 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows— This amount is converted into US dollars using the spot rate on 17 February 1989, NZ$631,892 × .6300 = US$385,492. The foreign interest rate is that which results in the US$400,000 when discounted being equal to US$385,492. The rate calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, is 9.344% per annum. The present value as at supply date, calculated using this interest rate in the same way as shown in example (A), will give NZ$611,892 as above. The importance of deriving this foreign currency interest rate is that it allows the calculation of expenditure using Determination G9A, as above.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable Issued: 27 September 1996 G21A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G21: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable”. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What financial arrangements does this determination apply to? 1. This determination applies to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property (or “ASAP”) which is subject to the accrual rules, if the price for the property is denominated in a foreign currency (a “foreign currency ASAP”), and certain other conditions are met. It does not apply to a short term ASAP or a private or domestic ASAP (as those terms are defined in the Act), because these agreements are excepted financial arrangements. General principles of taxation of foreign currency ASAPs 2. For all ASAPs (whether or not denominated in a foreign currency) which are subject to the accrual rules, you must calculate a core acquisition price. This is the total of (a) (i) the lowest price that you and the other party would have agreed upon for the property at the time the ASAP was entered into, on the basis of payment in full at the time the first right in the specified property is to be transferred; or (ii) if there is no such lowest price, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property as determined under a determination; or (iii) if there is no such lowest price, and no applicable determination, the value of the property provided by the seller; and (b) any other amounts paid by the seller to the buyer (for purposes of explanation, these can safely be ignored). 3. This determination prescribes the method for determining the discounted value, in the foreign currency, of the amounts payable for the property, as set out in paragraph (2)(a)(ii). 4. For these purposes any amount determined in a currency other than NZ$ is required to be discounted using an interest rate appropriate to the currency. This determination requires the use of a foreign currency interest rate ascertained as at the rights date using a method consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields — this interest rate is the interbank offer rate for the currency and the term of the foreign currency ASAP. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5. The amounts payable are then discounted to the rights date, using the interest rate so ascertained and present value calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods or an alternative method producing not materially different results. 6. Once this amount has been determined, you must convert it into NZ$, using one of the following rates: • forward rate to rights date (Rate A); • forward rate to settlement date (Rate B); • spot rate at rights date (Rate C); • spot rate at contract date (Rate D); or • spot rate at settlement date (Rate E); as set out in paragraph (5) of Method. Use of these rates is subject to certain restrictions, set out in paragraphs 3(2), (3), (4) and (5) below. 7. Having calculated the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price, you must calculate your income or expenditure from the foreign currency ASAP using the corresponding method in Determination G29. 8. The NZ$ value of the foreign currency lowest price is also the price at which the property is deemed to have been sold or acquired by you for income tax purposes (under section EH 8(2)). How does this determination differ from G21? 9. This determination differs from Determination G21 by: (a) removing the option to discount future amounts payable under a foreign currency ASAP using a NZ$ interest rate; (b) removing the requirement to convert the discounted value of amounts payable using the spot rate on the rights date. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G21:Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency, with effect from the 1996/97 income year. 3 Scope of Determination 1. Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5), this determination applies to the calculation of income or expenditure under any foreign currency ASAP: (a) if there is no lowest price; and (b) with respect to which you become a party in your 1996–97 income year or a subsequent income year. 2. This determination does not apply: (a) To any deferred property settlement where more than 20% of the sum of all the amounts payable is due before 31 days prior to the rights date; or (b) Where in relation to any deferred property settlement any amount payable, or the date on which any amount is payable, is not known at the first balance date of the person after the transfer date; or (c) Where the term of the deferred property settlement is not known at the first balance date after the transfer date. 3. You may use Rate B only if the period between the rights date and the settlement date (date of final payment) of the foreign currency ASAP is not more than five years. 4. You may use Rates C and D only if the property that is the subject of the foreign currency ASAP is trading stock in relation to you, other than land or shares. 5. You may use Rate E only if the aggregate of your gross income (as defined in the Act) and that of all associated persons, in the income year you became a party to the foreign currency ASAP, does not exceed $2,500,000. For this purpose, gross income should be adjusted by excluding any income from foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to section EH 1 in the income year. 4 Principle 1. Under the qualified accrual rules a foreign currency ASAP gives rise to income or expenditure equal to the difference between the NZ$ value of the acquisition price of the ASAP and the NZ$ value of the price. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. The acquisition price is equal to the core acquisition price less (in the case of the holder) or plus (in the case of the issuer) any non-contingent fees paid by that party that qualify as item z in the definition of core acquisition price in the Act. 3. The core acquisition price is defined in section OB 1. In the case of an ASAP, the definition provides that in certain circumstances, the core acquisition price should be the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property, determined under a determination made by the Commissioner. 4. This determination provides for the determination of the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property under a foreign currency ASAP. The discounted value must be calculated. (a) in the base currency as if it were New Zealand $; (b) using an interest rate appropriate for the currency, the rate being a rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13A, Prices or Yields, that is the foreign interbank offer rate appropriate to the term of the foreign currency ASAP; (c) by then converting that amount to NZ$ using an appropriate rate as set out in paragraph (5) of Method. 5. You will have to spread any income or expenditure arising from the ASAP using the method in Determination G29 which is applicable to the rate you have used. 5 Interpretation In this determination: 1. a reference to the “Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994; 2. “Acceptable present value calculation method” means calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results: “ASAP” means an agreement for sale and purchase of property which is subject to the accrual rules; “Foreign currency ASAP” means an ASAP under which the price for the property the subject of the ASAP is denominated in a foreign currency; “Forward rate” means the rate for a forward contract as defined in paragraph 6(4) of Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Interbank offer rate” in relation to a term means the rate at which a bank makes funds available to another bank which is a highly reliable credit risk and a trader in the market for such funds and for such a term; and includes, according to the circumstance, the rates collectively referred to as “LIBOR” and “SIBOR”; “Lowest price” is the lowest price referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of “core acquisition price”; “Price” means the Foreign Currency price agreed to be paid in consideration for the property under an ASAP, including any agreed interest charges; “Rights date” is the day on which the first Right in the specified property subject to an ASAP is to be transferred; “Specified property” means property that is acquired or sold pursuant to a deferred property settlement: “Spot rate” means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; 3. all other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. As an aid to interpretation only, and not as a definitive list, the following are the terms defined in the Act that are of particular note: right in the specified property, agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 6 Method 1. For the purposes of paragraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in the definition of the core acquisition price in section OB 1, you must calculate the discounted value of the foreign currency amounts payable for the property subject to a foreign currency ASAP to which this determination applies by summing— (a) Every amount payable to or, as the case may be, by you for the property on or before the rights date expressed in the foreign currency; and (b) The amount of foreign currency equal in value to the present value as at the rights date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the property after the rights date. 2. For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at rights date of amounts payable shall be calculated by applying an acceptable present value calculation method to the interest rate determined under subclause (3). G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3. The annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be: the interbank offer rate for the currency and the term of the foreign currency ASAP at rights date, being a market yield determined in a manner consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. For this purpose the spot rate and the forward rate are to be determined in accordance with Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates. 4. The present value of the amounts payable together with any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the rights date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisition price. 5. This amount is then converted to NZ$ using one of the following rates as appropriate; (a) the rate, on the contract date, available to the taxpayer from a New Zealand registered bank for the exchange of NZ$ for that foreign currency on the rights date (Rate A); or (b) the rate, on the contract date, available to the taxpayer from a New Zealand registered bank for the exchange of NZ$ for that foreign currency on the settlement date (Rate B); or (c) Spot rate on the rights date (Rate C) (d) Spot rate on the contract date (Rate D) (e) Spot rate on payment (Rate E). 6. The core acquisition price shall be used to determine the acquisition price of a foreign currency ASAP in accordance with section OB 1. 7. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by applying the Method in Determination G29 which corresponds with the rate you use to determine the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price. 7 Example 1. A commercial property is sold for US$1,400,000 under a sale and purchase agreement subject to certain repairs being made to the building. An initial deposit of $140,000 is made on 1 February 1989. On 1 March 1989 repairs on the building are complete and the sale becomes unconditional. The balance of US$ 1,260,000 is due six months after the date possession passes. Possession of the property passes on 15 March 1989. Therefore the term of the arrangement is 15 March 1989 to 15 September 1989 — 184 days. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The purchaser's balance date is 31 March. The USD/NZD exchange rates for the various dates are— 1 February 1989 0.5600 15 March 1989 0.5800 31 March 1989 0.5750 15 September 1989 0.5700 In this case the purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the accruals legislation. 2. The US interbank offer rate on 15 March 1989 for a period of six months is 8.0 percent ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. 3. Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 15 March 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows— (a) At 15 March 1989: A = 0 B = $1,260,000 C = 0 Therefore present value at 15 March 1989 (b) To this total must be added US$140,000 deposit, giving a total present value of US$1,351,538, which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisition price. G21A 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement.

Determination G22A: Optional Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars This determination may be cited as “Determination G22A: Optional convertible notes denominated in New Zealand dollars”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This determination gives the methods under the financial arrangements rules for calculating income, expenditure and the base price adjustment in relation to optional convertible notes that are denominated in New Zealand dollars. An optional convertible note is a type of convertible note. A convertible note is a financial arrangement in the form of an instrument issued by a company (the issuer) to a person (the subscriber or a holder) who provides money to the company. A third party (a holder) may acquire a previous holder’s interest in the optional convertible note. Under a convertible note, the company is required to repay in cash or new shares in the issuer at a future date. A convertible note usually, although not necessarily, requires the company to pay interest during the period of the loan. Optional convertible notes may grant either the company or the holder the right to elect to have the underlying debt settled for either cash or shares. This determination applies only to optional convertible notes under which the holder has a right to choose whether the repayment is to be in cash or new issuer shares. This determination applies to an optional convertible note which contains either an option that can be exercised only at maturity (a European-style warrant) or allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the optional convertible note’s term (an American-style warrant). This determination applies to persons who become a party to the relevant optional convertible note on or after the date of this determination. It also applies to relevant optional convertible notes entered into before the date of this determination if the four-year “grandparenting” period provided for in sections 90 (6B) and 90 AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has expired. Those applying this determination must also have the following information by their first balance date following the date on which they become a party to the convertible note: (a) The value of the consideration that the person holding the note may choose to accept (the cash redemption amount) in repayment instead of shares; (b) the maturity date; (c) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the note by the holder; (d) the dates of payments to be made under the note by the company; and (e) the amounts of the payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the note by the company or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate. As this information is necessary to calculate the net present value of the debt component of the optional convertible note, this determination does not apply if the preceding information is not available by the appropriate time. This determination recognises that an optional convertible note has both a debt component and an equity component; the equity component is the option (or warrant) to receive repayment of the debt in the form of new shares. This determination prescribes methods of separating the consideration under the convertible note into debt and equity components. The value of the debt component is used to calculate, for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, financial arrangement income or expenditure during the term of the optional convertible note and the base price adjustment at the end of the term. Generally, if the issuer and the subscriber are members of the same wholly owned group of companies or if the exercise of the option would result in there being no change in the ownership of the company, no value will be attributed to the optional convertible note’s equity component. Accordingly, all consideration paid by or to or on behalf of any person under the optional convertible note is attributed to the debt component. However, this rule does not apply in circumstances where the subscriber subsequently sells the notes to third parties within 93 days of acquisition. If the value of the optional convertible note’s equity component is not zero, the equity component’s value (for both company and holder) is the amount by which the consideration paid by the holder exceeds the debt component’s present value. The present value is calculated as required by another determination by reference to the debt component’s cashflows. Cashflows consist of the following payments payable over the term of the optional convertible notes: (a) The cash redemption amount; (b) the coupon interest payments, if any; and (c) any contingent fees. The income or expenditure for each of the years before the final year of the term must be calculated by reference to the debt component’s value. The calculation must be made using the yield to maturity method or using an alternative method producing results that are not materially different from those that would be produced by the yield to maturity method. The appropriate methods, and their application, are prescribed under the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the Act”). This determination provides for the following consideration flows for calculating the base price adjustment under the financial arrangements rules: (a) where the optional convertible note contains a European-style warrant, this determination assumes that the debt component of the consideration paid or received by the issuer or holder on maturity is the face value of the optional convertible note. If the holder elects to be repaid with new shares, any difference between the value of the shares and the optional convertible note’s face value is treated as being attributable to the equity component; and (b) where the optional convertible note contains an American-style warrant that allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the optional convertible note’s term, this determination assumes that the debt component of the consideration paid or received by the issuer or holder on the exercise date is the present value of the optional convertible note debt component. The overall effect of this determination is that the financial arrangements rules treat an optional convertible note as if it were a bond that: (a) is issued at a price that excludes any amount paid or received for the optional convertible note’s equity component (if any); and (b) is settled for its face value (or its present value if converted before the end of its term). This determination replaces Determination G22\*. It applies: (a) from the date of this determination to financial arrangements that a person becomes party to on or after the date of this determination; and (b) four years after the date of this determination for financial arrangements that were entered into before the date of this determination, and that currently apply Determination G22, satisfy the criteria of this determination and have not matured within that four-year period. 2. Reference This determination is made under sections 90 (1) (c) and (g), and 90 AC (1) (d) and (h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope 1. This determination replaces Determination G22. It applies in relation to a financial arrangement that is a convertible note which contains either a share warrant that the holder can exercise only on the maturity date or a share warrant that allows the holder to exercise the warrant component during the convertible note’s term: (a) that a person becomes party to on or after the date of this determination; and (b) four years after the date of this determination for financial arrangements that were entered into before the date of this determination, and that currently apply Determination G22, satisfy the criteria of this determination and have not matured within that four-year period. 2. This determination applies in relation to a financial arrangement that is a convertible note for which: (a) all amounts payable under the convertible note are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (b) the person has the following information by the person’s first balance date that follows the day on which the person issues or acquires the convertible note: (i) The cash redemption amount; and (ii) the maturity date; and (iii) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the convertible note by the holder; and (iv) the dates of payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the convertible note by the issuer; and (v) the amounts of the payments, other than in repayment, to be made under the convertible note by the company that issues the convertible note or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate; and (c) the person holding the convertible note may choose whether consideration in the form of shares or other consideration is to be provided by the company issuing the convertible note in discharge of the liability to make repayment; and (d) the company that issues the convertible note cannot require the person holding the convertible note to accept consideration in a particular form in discharge of the liability to make repayment; and (e) the option to accept shares in repayment cannot be separated from the convertible note. 4. Principle 1. An optional convertible note is a financial arrangement with a debt component and an equity component. The equity component, being the share warrant, is an excepted financial arrangement. 2. To apply the financial arrangements rules to a person and an optional convertible note, it is necessary to identify the part of the consideration provided and received by the person under the optional convertible note that is solely attributable to the optional convertible note’s equity component. That part is not included in the calculation under the financial arrangements rules of the income or expenditure arising under the optional convertible note. 3. None of the consideration provided or received by a party under the optional convertible note is attributed to the optional convertible note’s equity component and all consideration paid or received under the optional convertible note is attributed to the debt component if: (a) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured at the date of issue, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised at that time. 4. Subclause (3) does not apply if the subscriber intends to sell the optional convertible notes to an independent third party within 93 days of acquiring the notes and does so sell them. 5. If subclause (3) does not apply, the effect of this determination is that a party to an optional convertible note is taxed as if the optional convertible note were a bond that: (a) is issued at a price excluding an amount paid or received for the share warrant; and (b) is redeemable for the cash redemption amount or its present value if converted early; and (c) otherwise has the same terms as the optional convertible note. 6. If subclause (3) does not apply, this determination attributes to the value of the share warrant any difference between the consideration actually provided under the optional convertible note and the consideration that is deemed to be provided for the bond described in subclause (5). 5. Interpretation 1. In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004. 2. In this determination: cash redemption amount, for an optional convertible note, means the amount that the holder receives in repayment under the optional convertible note if the person elects not to exercise the share warrant which is part of the optional convertible note, being its agreed future value or face value contingent fees is the amount of the fees payable by the person that are contingent on the optional convertible note being issued convertible note— (a) means an instrument issued by a company that: (i) is evidence of, acknowledges, creates, or relates to, a loan or other advance to the company, or any other secured or unsecured liability of the company; and (ii) provides that there is an option to require all or part of the liability referred to in subparagraph (i) to be redeemed or paid by the issue or delivery of new shares in the company: (b) includes any subsidiary or collateral agreement that fixes the amount of a coupon interest payment to be made under the instrument described in paragraph (a) coupon interest, for an optional convertible note, means an amount that: (a) is payable or receivable under the optional convertible note by the company; and (b) is not a contingent fee or part of the cash redemption amount for the optional convertible note debt component, for an optional convertible note, means that portion of the optional convertible note that is subject to the financial arrangements rules and treated under this determination as if it were a bond but does not include the equity component Determination G22 means Determination G22: Optional Conversion Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars Convertible at the Option of the Holder issued by the Commissioner on 24 October 1990 equity component, for an optional convertible note, means the share warrant holder, for an optional convertible note, means the subscriber or a person other than the subscriber that has acquired the optional convertible note issuer, for an optional convertible note, means the company issuing the optional convertible note and, in respect of any obligation to issue new shares on redemption, includes any company that is required to issue those shares market value interests means market value interests as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition in section OB 1 of the Act maturity date, for an optional convertible note, means the last date on which the company is required to settle the optional convertible note (whether for the cash redemption amount or for new shares in the company) optional convertible note means a convertible note that satisfies the following requirements: (a) all amounts payable under the convertible note are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (b) the person either issues, subscribes for or acquires the convertible note on or after the date of this determination or the person issued, subscribed for or acquired the convertible note before the date of this determination, has applied Determination G22 to the convertible note and the convertible note has not matured within four years of the date of this determination; and (c) the person has the following information by the person’s first balance date that follows the day on which the person issues or acquires the convertible note: (i) the cash redemption amount; and (ii) the maturity date; and (iii) the amounts and dates of payments to be made under the note by the holder; and (iv) the amounts, or the fixed relationship between the amount of each such payment and a market or indicator interest rate, and dates of payments (other than in repayment) to be made under the note by the issuer; and (d) the holder can elect to settle the convertible note’s face value for new shares in the issuer, rather than the cash redemption amount; and (e) the issuer cannot elect whether the convertible note can be cash settled or redeemed for shares; and (f) the share warrant cannot be separated from the convertible note. specified rate, for an optional convertible note and a date, means the specified rate given for the optional convertible note and the date by Determination G23: Specified Rate share warrant, for an optional convertible note, means the right of the subscriber or holder to elect to settle the optional convertible note by receiving new shares in the issuer subscriber, for an optional convertible note, means the person that subscribes for the optional convertible note issued by the issuer term, for an optional convertible note and a person, means the period between the date on which the optional convertible note is issued and the maturity date voting interests means voting interests as defined in paragraph (a) of the definition in section OB 1 of the Act 3. In this determination, a term not referred to in subclauses (1) and (2) has the meaning given to the term for the purpose of— (a) the financial arrangements rules, if the term is defined in the Act for that purpose; (b) the Act, if paragraph (a) does not apply. 4. In this determination, a reference to another determination made by the Commissioner includes a reference to a determination that, with or without modification, replaces or corresponds to that determination. 6. Method 1. This determination treats an optional convertible note as having both a debt component and an equity component. The equity component, being the share warrant, is an excepted financial arrangement. 2. This determination gives the method for determining the amount of consideration paid or received under the optional convertible note that is solely attributable to the equity component for the purposes of determining: (a) the income or expenditure for an income year that is attributable to the debt component; (b) the base price adjustment for the debt component. Consideration provided by person that is attributable to equity component 3. The amount of the consideration provided by a subscriber or received by an issuer that is solely attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is nil if: (a) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) the parties to the optional convertible note at the date of issue are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured at the date of issue, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised at that time. 4. Subclause (3) does not apply if the subscriber: (a) acquired the optional convertible note with the intention of selling it within 93 days to any person whose exercise of the share warrant would result in a change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests of the issuer; and (b) does so sell the optional convertible note. 5. If subclause (3) does not apply, the amount of the consideration provided or received by a person that is attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is the greater of— (a) nil; or (b) the amount given by the following formula: y – s 6. In subclause (5) (b), y, being the consideration for the optional convertible note, is: (a) for the issuer, the amount of consideration that has been paid, and consideration that is or will be payable, to the issuer for or under the optional convertible note, ignoring non-contingent fees; (b) for the subscriber, the amount of consideration that has been paid, and consideration that is or will be payable, by the subscriber for or under the optional convertible note, ignoring non-contingent fees. 7. In subclause (5) (b), s, being the present value of cashflows, is the present value of the amount given by the following formula: total coupon interest + contingent fees + cash redemption amount 8. In subclause (7), total coupon interest is the total amount of all coupon interest payable or receivable during the term of the optional convertible note. 9. In subclause (7), contingent fees and cash redemption amount are as defined in subclause 5 (2) of the interpretation section of this determination. 10. In subclause (7), the present value of an amount is determined by applying: (a) Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods; or (b) an alternative method that produces a result that is not materially different from the method referred to in paragraph (a). 11. If the amount of a coupon interest payment under an optional convertible note has a fixed relationship to a market or indicator interest rate, a person who is required by this determination to estimate the amounts of future coupon interest payments under the optional convertible note may assume that the coupon interest rate applicable to the first coupon interest payment in the term applies to the remaining coupon interest payments in the term. Spreading the debt component 12. For the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, the amount of income or expenditure under an optional convertible note that a person must attribute to an income year in the term of the optional convertible note is found by using a spreading method prescribed under sub-part EW of the Act to spread the consideration referable to the debt component of the optional convertible note. In this context, the consideration referable to the debt component is the amount given by the following formula: For the issuer: (consideration received – value of warrant) – consideration paid with a negative amount being a deduction under the financial arrangements rules. For the holder: consideration received – (consideration paid – value of warrant) with a positive amount being income under the financial arrangements rules. 13. In subclause (12): (a) consideration received is the amount of consideration that is or will be received, and the amount of consideration that has been received, by the person for and under the optional convertible note, including coupon interest receipts and contingent fees, but ignoring non-contingent fees and treating any consideration received in repayment of the optional convertible note as being equal to the cash redemption amount. (b) consideration paid is the amount of consideration that is or will be payable, and the amount of consideration that has been paid, by the person for and under the optional convertible note, including coupon interest payments and contingent fees, but ignoring non-contingent fees and treating any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note as being equal to the cash redemption amount. (c) value of warrant is the amount of consideration referable to the equity component as determined under subclause (3) or (5) above Secondary market 14. Where a holder sells or transfers an optional convertible note to another holder, the amount of the consideration provided or received that is solely attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible note is nil if: (a) at the time of the sale or transfer the parties are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or (b) at the time of the sale or transfer the parties are beneficially owned or ultimately controlled by the same person; or (c) under the arrangement, however structured, there would be no change to either of the voting interests or the market value interests in the issuer if the share warrant were exercised both prior to and after the sale or transfer. 15. If subclause (14) does not apply, subclauses (5) to (12) will apply to determine the amount of consideration received by a holder and paid by the new holder that is referable to the debt component of the optional convertible note when the optional convertible note is sold or transferred. Base price adjustment on maturity or exercise 16. For the purposes of the base price adjustment formula specified in section EW 31 of the Act, in determining the consideration that is paid by the issuer or paid to the holder: (a) where the holder can exercise the share warrant only on the maturity date, any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note is treated as being equal to the cash redemption amount; or (b) where the holder can exercise the share warrant at any time or at agreed times prior to the maturity date, and the share warrant is exercised prior to the maturity date, any consideration paid in repayment of the optional convertible note is treated as being equal to the present value of the optional convertible note’s debt component on the date the share warrant is exercised. 17. In subclause (16) (b), the present value of the optional convertible note’s debt component is determined by applying the formula specified in subclause (7). 7. Examples Example A: From the perspective of the issuer On 1 April 2007, a publicly listed New Zealand company, ABC Ltd, raised $120 million from the market through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a five-year term. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid a coupon rate of 5% per annum semi-annual. At the time the optional convertible notes were issued, ABC Ltd had one billion shares on issue, which were trading at $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holders could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem each optional convertible note for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of each optional convertible note was $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by the holders of the optional convertible notes was $120 million. ABC Ltd paid $1 million to a broker for the successful issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue was 5.81%. ABC Ltd has a 31 March balance date. This determination requires that a bifurcation process be applied in order to calculate an amount that is solely attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes. The warrant is an excepted financial arrangement and is excluded from calculation of financial arrangement income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. To calculate the total amount of consideration attributed to the equity component of the optional convertible notes, subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied. The consideration paid for the optional convertible notes is $120 million. Therefore y = $120 million. The present value (PV) of the bond component applying subclause 6 (7) is $96,528,457.95. This amount may be calculated in accordance with Determination G10B or through the use of the standard market bond pricing formula. The discount rate applicable to this calculation is the specified rate in accordance with Determination G23. Therefore s = $96,528,457.95. The aggregate amount attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible notes is therefore: $120,000,000.00 – $96,528,457.95 = $23,471,542.05. This amount may be ignored for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. In order to calculate financial arrangement income or expenditure, the yield to maturity (YTM) method has been applied. This may be done in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or any other determination that may apply, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. The yield to maturity for the financial arrangement is 6.04973318% or 3.024867% per semi-annual period. Notwithstanding the methods available which have been described above, the YTM rate is most easily calculated by calculating the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows arising under the bond component of the optional convertible notes by iterating the discount rate used until a result of zero is achieved. Using Determination G3, the following table can be constructed (taking into account the deduction of $1 million of fees paid by ABC Ltd): Critical dates Amount of principal outstanding at start of period YTM calc F.A. expenditure at end of period Actual coupon interest at end of period Amount of principal outstanding at end of period 1 Apr 07 95,528,457.95 2,889,608.41 2,500,000.00 95,918,066.36 1 Oct 07 95,918,066.36 2,901,393.54 2,500,000.00 96,319,459.90 1 Apr 08 96,319,459.90 2,913,535.16 2,500.000.00 96,732,995.06 1 Oct 08 96,732,995.08 2,926,044.05 2,500,000.00 97,159,039.11 1 Apr 09 97,159,039.11 2,938,931.31 2,500,000.00 97,597,970.42 1 Oct 09 97,597,970.42 2,952,208.40 2,500,000.00 98,050,178.82 1Apr 10 98,050,178.82 2,965,887.10 2,500,000.00 98,516,065.92 1 Oct 10 98,516,065.92 2,979,979.56 2,500,000.00 98,996,045.48 1 Apr 11 98,996,045.48 2,994,498.30 2,500,000.00 99,490,543.78 1 Oct 11 99,490,543.78 3,009,456.22 2,500,000.00 100,000,000.00 1 Apr 12 0 Totals 29,471,542.05 25,000,000.00 The difference between financial arrangement expenditure and coupon interest paid by ABC Ltd is $4,471,542.05 and is equal to the difference between the FV of the bond component and its price calculated using the specified rate of 5.81% per annum semi-annual plus the $1 million in fees paid by ABC Ltd. Financial arrangement expenditure is spread between income years, in accordance with Determination G1A, on a daily basis. So, for example, in the 2008 income year, ABC Ltd would return financial arrangement expenditure of $5,791,001.95 in relation to this financial arrangement. The sum of $5,839,579.21 would be returned in the 2009 income year. A base price adjustment (BPA) is required in the final year of the optional convertible notes’ term. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted. Consideration in relation to the financial arrangement is: 96,528,457.95 + (25,000,000) + (1,000,000) + (100,000,000) = (29,471,542.05) Income is zero. Expenditure is $23,467,587.53 and is the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated and deducted up to and including 31 March 2011. There is no remission. The BPA amount is therefore: (29,471,542.05) – 0.00 + 23,467,587.53 + 0.00 = (6,003,954.52). As this is a negative amount, it is financial arrangement expenditure for ABC Ltd. As no amount is remitted, the amount of the BPA is exactly equal to the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated in the final year of the financial arrangement under the YTM method. A similar calculation must be undertaken to calculate the holder’s position if the holder is subject to the financial arrangements rules. Example B: From the perspective of the issuer On 1 April 2007, XYZ Ltd, a non-listed company and a wholly owned subsidiary of another company (“Parent”) raised $100 million through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a five-year term to Parent. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid no coupons. At the time of the optional convertible notes issue, XYZ Ltd had 100 shares which were issued for $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holder could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem the optional convertible notes for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of the optional convertible notes is $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by Parent for the optional convertible notes was $100 million. XYZ Ltd paid no fees to issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue was 5.81%. XYZ Ltd has a 31 March balance date. This determination requires that a bifurcation process be applied in order to calculate an amount that is solely attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes. The warrant is an excepted financial arrangement and is excluded from calculation of financial arrangement income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. To calculate the amount of consideration attributed to the equity component of the optional convertible notes, subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied, unless subclause 6 (3) applies. As the companies are members of the same wholly owned group of companies, the amount of consideration attributable to the warrant component of the optional convertible notes is nil. Accordingly, all of the consideration received from the issuance by XYZ Ltd of the optional convertible notes must be attributed to the bond component. Therefore, no financial arrangement income or expenditure arises in relation to this financial arrangement. A similar calculation must be undertaken to calculate the holder’s position if the holder is subject to the financial arrangements rules. Example C On 1 April 2007, a publicly listed New Zealand company, XYZ Ltd, raised $100 million through the issue of 100 million $1.00 optional convertible notes with a five-year term. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value of $100 million, paid a coupon of 3% per annum, semi-annual, and were issued at par to the optional convertible notes’ face value. For commercial reasons, the subscriber for the optional convertible notes was a member of the same wholly owned group of companies that acquired the notes with the intention of selling the optional convertible notes to institutional third party investors for $100 million. Settlement with the institutional third party investors was to occur on 1 July 2007. At the time the optional convertible notes were issued, XYZ Ltd had one billion shares on issue, which were trading at $1.00 each. The terms of the optional convertible notes provided that the holders could at any time over the term of the optional convertible notes elect to redeem the optional convertible notes for cash or for one share per note held. The exercise price on the American-style warrant component of the optional convertible notes is $1.00 per share. The total consideration paid by the subscriber (a member of the same wholly owned group of companies as XYZ Ltd) of the optional convertible notes was $100 million. No fees were payable by XYZ Ltd in relation to issue of the optional convertible notes. The five-year New Zealand government bond rate at the time of issue (1 April 2007), and when the optional convertible notes were on-sold (1 July 2007), was 5.81%. XYZ Ltd has a 31 March balance date. Given the subscriber’s intention to sell the optional convertible notes within 93 days of their issuance date, the provisions contained in subclause 6 (3) of this determination do not apply if the notes are sold to relevant third parties within the requisite period. In such circumstances, the bifurcation process described in subclause 6 (5) of this determination must be applied by XYZ Ltd when the optional convertible notes are initially issued to the member of the same wholly owned group of companies on 1 April 2007. The bifurcation process must also be applied by the relevant parties (to the extent that the financial arrangements rules apply) on 1 July 2007 when the subscriber sells the optional convertible notes to the third party investors. XYZ Ltd’s financial arrangements rules treatment of the optional convertible notes is the same as if it had issued the notes directly to third party investors. However, should the subscriber fail to sell the notes to those investors within the requisite time frame, subclause 6 (3) will apply to XYZ Ltd. In regard to the first part of this arrangement, the aggregate consideration for the optional convertible notes when they were initially issued was $100 million. Therefore y = $100 million. The PV of the bond component on the original date of issue applying subclause 6 (7) is $87,956,749.20. Therefore s = $87,956,749.20. The aggregate amount attributable to the equity component of the optional convertible notes is therefore: $100,000,000.00 – $87,956,749.20 = $12,043,250.80. This amount may be ignored for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules. The YTM method or alternative method, as prescribed under the Act, must be applied in order to calculate financial arrangement income or expenditure on the bond component of the optional convertible notes by XYZ Ltd. For the tax period ending 31 March 2008, XYZ Ltd’s calculation of financial arrangement expenditure will be $5,140,939.04. If the optional convertible notes are not exercised and run for their full maturity under the contracted terms of the arrangement, XYZ Ltd will be entitled to claim total financial arrangement expenditure of $27,043,250.81, apportioned each year under the YTM method and BPA requirements. If the financial arrangements rules apply to the subscriber, that person will derive income from the bond component of the optional convertible notes calculated in accordance with subclause 6 (5) of this determination and the requirement to perform a BPA. Assuming the subscriber is subject to the financial arrangements rules, it paid $100 million to XYZ Ltd on 1 April 2007 and received $100 million from third party investors when the optional convertible notes were sold on 1 July 2007. The PV of the bond on 1 July 2007 was $89,218,194.23, applying the bifurcation process, a difference of $1,261,445.03 from the PV of $87,956,749.20 calculated applying the bifurcation process on 1 April 2007. The subscriber is required to perform a BPA and account for this amount of financial arrangement income. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted. Consideration in relation to the financial arrangement is: (87,956,749.20) + 89,218,194.23 = 1,261,445.03 Income is zero as the BPA occurs in the first year of the financial arrangement and, consequently, no other income has been recognised for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules. Expenditure is zero. There is no remission. The BPA amount, is therefore: 1,261,445.03 – 0.00 + 0.00 +0.00 = 1,261,445.03. As this is a positive amount, it is financial arrangement income for the subscriber. For the avoidance of doubt, if the subscriber does not sell the optional convertible notes to the institutional investors (or any other relevant third party) within 93 days from the date of issue, subclause 6 (3) will apply. Example D: From the perspective of the issuer In Example A of this determination, on 1 April 2007 ABC Ltd raised $120 million from the market through the issue of 100 million $1 optional convertible notes with a term of five years. The optional convertible notes had an aggregate face value (FV) of $100 million and paid a coupon rate of 5% per annum semi-annual and could be exercised for 100 million shares at any time on or before 1 April 2012. For the purposes of this example, the optional convertible notes described in Example A were widely held. On 1 April 2009, for commercial reasons, all of the investors holding the optional convertible notes elected to exercise the warrant component of the optional convertible notes and redeem the optional convertible notes for 100 million shares priced at $1.00 each. It should be noted that the investors made their election to convert immediately following receipt of the coupon payment (totalling $2.5 million) from ABC Ltd on 1 April 2009. In accordance with section EW 29 of the Act, ABC Ltd is required to perform a base price adjustment. The specified rate on 1 April 2009 for the three-year government bond was 5.81% per annum semi-annual (there had been no change to the specified rate which applied when the optional convertible notes were originally issued on 1 April 2007.) The PV of the aggregate bond component of the optional convertible notes on 1 April 2009 calculated in accordance with Determination G10B or through the use of the standard market bond pricing formula is $97,799,112.60 and would be the amount that ABC Ltd would be required to repay all of the holders of the optional convertible notes if the debt were extinguished at that point. The formula for a BPA is: Consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted In accordance with subclause 6 (16), the amount of consideration referable to the financial arrangement (debt component of the optional convertible notes) is: (120,000,000 – 23,471,542.05) – (10,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 97,799,112.60) = (12,270,654.65) Income is zero. Expenditure is $11,630,581.16 and is the amount of financial arrangement expenditure calculated and deducted up to and including 31 March 2009. An extract from the table constructed in Example A has been replicated below to assist with the explanation of how the financial arrangements expenditure amount has been calculated for the purpose of this BPA example. Critical dates Amount of principal outstanding at start of period YTM Calc F.A. expenditure at end of period Actual coupon interest at end of period Amount of principal outstanding at end of period 1 Apr 07 95,528,457.95 2,889,608.41 2,500,000.00 95,918,066.36 1 Oct 07 95,918,066.36 2,901,393.54 2,500,000.00 96,319,459.90 1 Apr 08 96,319,459.90 2,913,535.16 2,500.000.00 96,732,995.06 1 Oct 08 96,732,995.08 2,926,044.05 2,500,000.00 97,159,039.11 1 Apr 09 97,159,039.11 Totals 11,630,581.16 10,000,000.00 There is no remission. The BPA amount is therefore: (12,270,654.65) – 0.00 + 11,630,581.16 + 0.00 = (640,073.49) As this amount is a negative amount, it is financial arrangement expenditure for ABC Ltd. A similar calculation must be undertaken to calculate each holder’s position if that person is subject to the financial arrangements rules. Signed on the 26th day of September 2006.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Specified Rate Issued: 24 October 1990 G23 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G23: Specified Rate”. G23 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination applies where for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure it is necessary to determine an annual yield or interest rate for valuation purposes. This rate is called the specified rate. The rate may be required where the present value of an amount payable or receivable under a financial arrangement is to be calculated. Such a calculation is necessary, for example, in Determination G22: Optional Conversion Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars Convertible at the Option of the Holder. 2. When a financial arrangement is denominated in New Zealand dollars the specified rate is the market yield applying to Bank Bills of a similar Term to the Term of the financial arrangement; if the Term is longer than 12 months the market yield on New Zealand Government Stock must be used. 3. When a financial arrangement is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars the specified rate is— (a) The interbank bid or offer rate for the currency and the Term of the financial arrangement; or (b) An implied foreign currency interest rate calculated by reference to appropriate forward and spot exchange rates and the New Zealand Bank Bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the Term of the financial arrangement. 4. An implied foreign currency interest rate will generally be calculated when it is not easy to find a quoted interbank interest rate for the currency and Term of a financial arrangement. 5. The specified rate will be required by other determinations which will detail the method or methods to be applied to determine income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a particular class of financial arrangement. That method will include the date at which the specified rate is to be determined, the currency of the financial arrangement and the Term. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(a) to (f) of the Income Tax Act 1976. G23 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Scope This determination shall be used to select a yield or interest rate as required by any other determination issued pursuant to section 64E of the Income Tax Act 1976. 4 Principle 1. The specified rate is a market base rate for borrowing in a particular currency for a particular Term. 2. Where the base rate in a currency is not readily obtainable it may be calculated from spot and forward exchange rates for converting the currency to New Zealand dollars and New Zealand dollar interest rates. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meaning as in The Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of The Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “Acceptable Present Value Calculation Method” means Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Bank Bill” means an order to pay drawn upon and accepted by a person who is a registered bank for the purposes of the Reserve Bank Act, 1989: “Base Currency” in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency in respect of which a specified rate is to be calculated: “Forward Rate” means the rate for a forward contract determined in a manner consistent with Determination G6C: Foreign Currency Rates provided that the currency in respect of which the Forward Rate is to be found need not be one of the currencies referred to in Determination G6C: “Interbank Rate” means the bid or offer rate quoted for deposits in the Base Currency determined in a manner consistent with Determination G13A: Prices and Yields G23 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] provided that the market in respect of which the rate is to be found need not be one of the markets referred to in Determination G13A: “Spot Rate” means the rate for a spot contract determined in a manner consistent with Determination G6C: Foreign Currency Rates provided that the currency in respect of which the Spot Rate is to be found need not be one of the currencies referred to in Determination G6C: “Term” means the Term of the financial arrangement specified in the determination which requires a specified rate to be used. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict or extend that determination. 3. For convenience, words or phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method 1. The specified rate at any date in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in New Zealand currency is— (a) Where the Term of the financial arrangement is twelve months or less, the yield for Bank Bills of a similar Term to the Term of the financial arrangement; (b) In any other case, the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar Term to the Term of the financial arrangement— determined in accordance with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. 2. The specified rate at any date in relation to a financial arrangement denominated in a foreign currency is— (a) The Interbank Rate for the Base Currency and the Term of the financial arrangement; or (b) A rate derived by— (i) Converting the final amount payable or receivable in relation to the financial arrangement from the Base Currency to New Zealand currency at the forward exchange rate appropriate to the Term of the financial arrangement; and G23 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) Calculating the present value of the amount thus calculated using an Acceptable Present Value Calculation Method and a rate determined in accordance with clause 6(1)(a) or (b); and (iii) Converting the amount thus calculated to the Base Currency at the Spot Rate for the currency; and (iv) Calculating the rate such that if an Acceptable Present Value Calculation Method were applied to the final payment in the Base Currency over the Term of the financial arrangement the present value so calculated would be equal to the amount calculated in subparagraph (iii) above. 7 Example A company is required to calculate the present value of US$100,000 payable on the 30 June 1991 as at balance date, 31 March 1991, as part of a method detailed in another determination to ascertain income derived or expenditure incurred from a financial arrangement. This determination approves two methods of selecting a specified rate: (a) The US interbank dollar offer rate (LIBOR or SIBOR) on 31.3.91 for 90 days is 8.6% p.a. (the specified rate) ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields; or (b) The company calculates an implied rate by the steps below: Convert the amount of US$100,000 using a forward exchange rate to New Zealand dollars. The Forward Rate for US dollars ascertained on 31 March 1991 for delivery in 90 days is USD/NZD 0.5688. US$100,000/0.5688 = NZ$175,809 Assume that the yield for NZ Bank Bills of a 90 day Term is 13.46% p.a., ascertained at 31 March 1991 in accordance with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. Foreign currency Spot Rate ascertained in accordance with Determination G6C: Foreign Currency Rates, as at 31 March 1991 is USD/NZD 0.5752. Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 31 March 1991 as follows— G23 24 October 1990 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 5 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This amount is converted to US dollars using the Spot Rate on 31 March 1991, NZ$170,085 × 0.5752 = US$97,833. The specified rate is that which results in the US$100,000 when discounted being equal to US$97,827. The rate calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, is 8.86% p.a. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement.

G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. Under section 64C(2A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”), a taxpayer may use the straight line method to account for financial arrangements. The method may be used when the total value of all financial arrangements issued and held by that taxpayer is less than $1,000,000 at all times during the income year. “Value” in relation to a financial arrangement is: (a) For a fixed principal financial arrangement the nominal or face value of the arrangement; and (b) For a variable principal debt instrument the amount owing by or to the person. 2. This determination sets out two methods for applying the straight line method to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred. Both methods refer to Total Finance Charges. The Total Finance Charges are the amount that will be spread over the term of the arrangement. 3. Total Finance Charges include interest, any premium or discount, and fees (excluding those deductible at the commencement of the loan). Interest payable under a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement is, however, excluded from the Total Finance Charges to be apportioned because it is not known in advance. 4. Method A applies only where the loan is for a fixed amount of principal with interest, if any, payable at regular intervals. All Periods Between Payments must be of equal length. Method A allocates the Total Finance Charges equally to each Period in the term of the arrangement. Method B applies where the principal outstanding may vary, and the payments may be at irregular intervals. It allocates the Total Finance Charges to each period in the term of the arrangement in proportion to the principal outstanding in each Period and the length of that Period. 5. A Variable Rate Financial Arrangement is one where the interest rate is linked to an external indicator price or index. In this case the actual interest payable in respect of a Period is added to the Total Finance Charges excluding interest that have been apportioned to that Period. Note that as a result the Total Finance Charges might be negative, if the Variable Rate Financial Arrangement was issued at a premium. 6. For this determination to apply— G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) The amounts and due dates of all principal repayments must be known or reasonably able to be anticipated, and (b) Interest, if any, must be calculated on the principal outstanding from time to time. 7. This determination can be applied to financial arrangements denominated in a foreign currency, in conjunction with Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. 8. Where a Period spans two income years, the amount of income derived or expenditure incurred, in respect of the Period is apportioned between income years on a daily basis using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 9. Section 64C(2B)(b) of the Act sets out the procedure to be followed on changing from the method previously used to account for the financial arrangement, to the straight line method. Example H illustrates how this procedure is applied. 10. Section 64C(2A)(c) of the Act says that a person using the straight line method must apply that method consistently to a financial arrangement until it matures, is sold, remitted or transferred unless the prior consent of the Commissioner to adopt another method is obtained. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Act. 3 Scope of Determination This determination applies where a person decides pursuant to section 64C(2A) of the Act to calculate the income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement using the straight line method, and the financial arrangement meets the following criteria: 1. The financial arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement as defined in this determination, or the interest rate, if any, is specified in the financial arrangement and is fixed; and 2. The amounts of principal (including any fees and any premium or discount at the time of issue or acquisition) and the times or intervals at which they are to be advanced and repaid are known or can reasonably be anticipated or are able to be determined as at the first balance date after issue or acquisition; and 3. Interest, if any, is calculated on the amount of principal outstanding from time to time. G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 Principle For financial arrangements which meet the criteria of this determination, the Total Finance Charges may be apportioned over the term of the financial arrangement pro rata with the principal expected to be outstanding in each Period Between Payments and the length of that Period. In the case of Variable Rate Financial Arrangements interest payable is excluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges; instead the actual interest payable in respect of a Period is added to the Total Finance Charges (excluding interest) which have been apportioned to that Period. In all other cases interest is included in the calculation of Total Finance Charges. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meaning as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Period” or “Period Between Payments” means the term, commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable: Provided that if a Period exceeds one year it shall be deemed to comprise one or more Periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the holder or issuer as the case may be) by a Period of less than one year: “Total Finance Charges” in relation to a financial arrangement means— (a) in respect of an issuer, the total of all amounts payable by the issuer less the total of all amounts receivable by the issuer, pursuant to the financial arrangement; (b) in respect of a holder, the total of all amounts receivable by the holder less the total of all amounts payable by the holder, pursuant to the financial arrangement; excluding amounts of interest payable or receivable under a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement: Provided that any amounts payable in relation to the financial arrangement shall be reduced by the amount of item z as defined in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act: G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Variable Rate Financial Arrangement” means a financial arrangement under which the interest rate is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking rates or general commercial rates. 2. The length of all the Periods or Periods Between Payments of a financial arrangement shall be measured in time units of days, weeks, fortnights, months, quarters, half years or years as is appropriate to the smallest Period Between Payments, provided that where such a time unit is inappropriate for only one or two Periods this fact shall be disregarded, and the length of those one or two Periods shall be measured in days and expressed as a fraction of the time units appropriate to the remaining Periods Between Payments. 3. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 4. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method 1. Method A (a) Method A may be applied to any financial arrangement where the amount of principal is fixed and interest, if any, is payable at regular intervals throughout the terms of the financial arrangement, and the length of all Periods Between Payments is the same. The financial arrangement may be issued at a premium or discount and fees may be payable. (b ) The amount of income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in a Period is an amount equal to— (i) The Total Finance Charges divided by the number of Periods in the financial arrangement, plus (ii) In the case of a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement the amount of interest payable or receivable in respect of that Period. (c) Income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred using this method shall be allocated to income years in accordance with Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. Method B (a) Method B may be applied to any financial arrangement. It shall be used in all cases where the length of the Periods Between Payments are unequal or the amount of principal varies. (b) The amount of income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in respect of a Period is equal to— (i) The amount calculated according to the formula— where— a is the Total Finance Charges payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be; b is the length of the Period; c is the amount of principal outstanding during the Period Between Payments; d is the sum of all items e calculated in respect of every Period Between Payments; and e in respect of any Period is (b × c), plus (ii) In the case of a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement the amount of interest payable or receivable in respect of that Period. (c) Income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred using this determination shall be allocated to income years in accordance with Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 7 Examples METHOD A 1. Example A (a fixed rate fixed principal borrowing) This is an example of a fixed rate borrowing under which the principal is fixed. G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] On 12 February 1992 a company borrows NZ$10,000 for 5 years at a fixed interest rate of 16 per cent p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The money is raised by issuing notes at a discount of 5 per cent. The borrower is a New Zealand taxpayer who is eligible to use the straight line method. Contingent fees of 2.5 per cent of $10,000 are payable by the borrower to the lender; there are no non-contingent fees. The Total Finance Charges payable by the borrower are— The length of each Period is measured in time units of half a year, and the principal outstanding is $10,000 throughout the term of the loan. There are 10 half yearly time periods over the 5 year term of the loan because interest is payable half-yearly. Therefore Method A may be used, and the expenditure incurred in each Period is the Total Finance Charges of $8750 divided by the number of Periods: $8,750/10 = $875 This expenditure would be spread between income years on a daily basis using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. In the first Period (12 February 1992 to 12 August 1992) the expenditure calculated using the straight line method is $875. There are 182 days in the Period. Expenditure on a daily basis is therefore $875/182 = $4.81. In the 1992 income year expenditure incurred is: 12/2/92 – 31/3/92 48 days 48 × $4.81 × $230.88 In the 1993 income year expenditure incurred is: (\*There are 181 days in the period 12 February 1993 to 12 August 1993 therefore the daily rate is $4.83) G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Expenditure for subsequent income years is calculated in the same way. Expenditure for each income year, except the year the loan matures, is shown below: When the arrangement matures the base price adjustment (section 64F ) is used to calculate expenditure in the final income year (1997). The base price adjustment is calculated according to the formula: Therefore a − (b + c) = $1,521.01. This amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred. If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of $875 in each Period. 2. Example B (a variable rate loan) This is the same as Example A except that interest is determined according to a market indicator, e.g. the bank bill or commercial bill rate. Since the notes with a face value of $10,000 were issued at a 5 per cent discount, and contingent fees of 2.5 per cent were payable by the borrower (to the lender), who is the issuer in relation to this financial arrangement, the Total Finance Charges to the borrower are— G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Note that since the arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement interest amounts are excluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges. The length of each Period is measured in time units of half a year, and the principal outstanding is $10,000 throughout. In the first period an interest rate of 10 per cent p.a. applied, and, interest of $500 was payable. Method A may be used to calculate the expenditure incurred in respect of each Period, that is— (a) $750/10 = $75 plus (b) the actual interest payable in respect of that Period. In the first six month Period the interest rate was 10 per cent p.a. so that total expenditure incurred was $75 plus actual interest of $500 which is $575. This expenditure would be allocated on a daily basis to each day in the Period using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. 3. Example C (a zero coupon loan) A New Zealand company raises $5,000 by issuing 5 year notes with a face value of $10,000 at a 50 per cent discount. No interest is payable. The taxpayer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The Total Finance Charges payable by the borrower are— In this case Method A may be used. G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Period Between Payments is 1 year and the appropriate time unit is a year. There are 5 periods between payments. Therefore the discount would be allocated equally as $1,000 to each of the five periods in the term of the loan, and would then be apportioned to income years using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. METHOD B 4. Example D (a reducing principal fixed interest loan) On 12 February 1992 a company borrows NZ$10,000 for 5 years. The money is raised by issuing notes at a discount of 4.5 per cent. $2,000 of the notes are to be repaid on each anniversary of the loan. Interest at 16 per cent p.a. is payable half yearly in arrears on the balance of the notes outstanding during the half year. The borrower is a New Zealand company. There are no fees. The taxpayer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The length of each Period is half a year. The interest payable in the first year is $1,600. Each subsequent year this reduces by $320. The Total Finance Charges to the borrower are therefore— (i) total interest payable 1,600 + 1,280 + 960 + 640 + 320 = 4,800 Therefore a = $5,250 (“a” is a variable used in the formula described in Method B). The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges, where b = 1 throughout (since there is one time unit of half a year in each Period):— G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] This expenditure would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjustment.) If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. 5. Example E (a reducing principal variable rate loan) This is the same as Example D except that interest is determined according to a market indicator. The notes, with a face value of $10,000, were issued at a 4.5 per cent discount. There are no fees. The Total Finance Charges to the borrower are— Note that since the arrangement is a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement interest amounts are excluded from the calculation of the Total Finance Charges. The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges, where “b” equals one throughout (since there is one time unit of half a year in each period). The G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] actual interest payable in the Period must be added to the amount apportioned in each Period to determine total expenditure. This expenditure would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjustment.) If the holder was a New Zealand taxpayer able to use the straight line method, it would be deemed to derive income of similar amounts. 6. Example F (a loan with different repayment periods) A New Zealand taxpayer borrows $75,000 and agrees to repay $100,000. Repayments are $30,000 at the end of year one and $70,000 at the end of year four. The taxpayer is an issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. The Total Finance Charges payable by the borrower are— The length of each Period is a year therefore b = 1. The principal outstanding is $100,000 in the first (one year) Period, and $70,000 in the subsequent Periods. Hence the Total Finance Charges are allocated as follows: G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The expenditure incurred in each Period would be spread between income years using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjustment.) 7. Example G (discounted Government Stock) A taxpayer buys New Zealand Government Stock on the secondary market. Details are as follows: Face value $500,000 Coupon 16 per cent p.a. payable half yearly Maturity 15 August 1994 Settlement 1 March 1992 Price $548,978 (YTM = 11.6% pa) The taxpayer is not a cash basis holder but is eligible to use the straight line method to account for its financial arrangements, and decides to do so. The Total Finance Charges are— G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There is a broken first Period of 167 days, followed by five half year Periods. A time unit of half years is appropriate. Since the Periods are of unequal length, Method B applies. The 167 days represents 167 × 2/365 = 0.9151 of a half year. Therefore b = 0.9151 in the first Period and b = 1 in the remaining periods as there is one time unit of half a year in each Period. The following table can be constructed: The income derived in each Period would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. (Note that in practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjustment.) 8. Example H (transition to the straight line method) This is similar to Example A, which is summarised as follows: G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] An amount of $9,250 (after fees and discount) is borrowed on 12 February 1991, repayable by 10 half yearly interest payments of $800 each, plus a final payment of $10,000. The yield to maturity is 18.356 per cent. Assume the borrower is a New Zealand taxpayer with a 31 March balance date and used the yield to maturity method for the first income year. Then the expenditure deemed to be incurred in the income year ending 31 March 1991 is calculated as follows: (a) Amount attributable to period 12 February–11 August 1991: $9,250 × 18.356%/2 = $849 (b) Amount attributable to income year ending 31 March 1991: $849 × 47 days/181 days = $220 Assume that in the 1991/1992 income year the taxpayer meets the criteria for the straight line method and decides to use Method A of this determination. Then the amount of expenditure calculated in accordance with section 64C(2B)(b) is as follows: (a) From example A, the amount of expenditure that would have been deemed to be incurred under the straight line Method A up to 31 March 1992 is as follows: (b) Therefore, using the formula in section 64C(2B)(b) (c) The amount calculated in accordance with the formula is— G24 10 July 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 15 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and since this is a negative amount, it is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the borrower. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement Issued: 28 May 1992 G25 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement”. G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. A financial arrangement may be varied for many reasons. It may be varied by mutual agreement between the parties, by operation of the terms of the arrangement (such as an option), or by a partial remission of debt. One way of effecting a change is by terminating the existing financial arrangement and issuing a new one. That situation is straight forward and does not need a specific determination. A base price adjustment is calculated and income or expenditure under the new financial arrangement is calculated using the yield to maturity method or an appropriate alternative. 2. This determination applies where the variation is effected by changes to the original financial arrangement. Such changes may have been contemplated or anticipated in the original financial arrangement, for example: (a) where there are options in the financial arrangement exercisable by either party, or (b) where the original financial arrangement contains an intent that it will be altered in certain prescribed ways (or at the agreement of the parties) on the happening of some event. In both these cases, at the date of acquisition, an accrual method can not be applied that will last unaltered until the maturity or other sale of the financial arrangement. This determination applies in such cases, even though the financial arrangement may set out quite clearly how it is to be altered. The determination does not apply where the terms of the financial arrangement are unequivocal as to the nature, time and amount of the changes made. 3. At the most basic level, a variation will involve a change to the cash flows or the dates upon which they are payable. 4. The method requires an adjustment to be made in the year of variation. The effect of the variation is that the total income or expenditure up to the end of the year of variation is equal to what it would have been had the timing and exact details of the variations been known at the date of issue or acquisition. 5. The method is similar to that used in section 64D(4) of the Act where a taxpayer becomes a cash basis holder. It is also similar to section 64C(2B) that gives a method of changing to the straight line method of accounting for financial arrangements from another method used. G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. This determination does not apply to variable rate financial arrangements, where the only variation is a change in the index, price, or rate (these will be dealt with by a subsequent determination entitled Variable Rate Financial Arrangements). It does apply where a variation occurs that does not result from a change in the indicator rate. For example when the amount of principal is varied without a corresponding payment or the margin above the indicator rate is varied. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope of Determination This determination applies to any financial arrangement where the amounts payable, or the dates on which they are payable, are varied after the date of issue or acquisition, but it does not apply: (a) To a Variable Rate Financial Arrangement (as defined in this determination) under which the only variation is a change in the economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking rates or general commercial rates, or (b) Where the variation is effected by the maturity or other termination of the financial arrangement and the issue of a new financial arrangement, or (c) Where the variation is made according to the terms of the financial arrangement, which terms are unequivocal as to the nature, time and amount of the changes made. 4 Principle The adjustment in this determination is made in the year of variation. The result is that the total accumulated income or expenditure up to the end of the year of variation is equal to that that would have applied had the changes been known at the date of issue or acquisition. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires: G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Expressions used have the same meaning as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M; “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976; “Variable Rate Financial Arrangement” means a financial arrangement under which: (a) the interest rate is determined by a fixed relationship to economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or prices, or banking or general commercial rates; or (b) the interest rate is set periodically by reference to market interest rates. 2. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Commissioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 3. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters. However, in the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method 1. In the income year in which a financial arrangement is varied, a person who is the issuer or holder of the financial arrangement shall include, in calculating assessable income for the income year, an amount in respect of the financial arrangement calculated in accordance with the following formula: a − b − c + d, where: a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure incurred by the person in respect of the financial arrangement from the date it was acquired or issued to the end of the income year, if the changes had been known as at the date the financial arrangement was acquired or issued; c is the sum of all amounts treated as income derived of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year; and G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] d is the sum of all amounts treated as expenditure incurred of the person in respect of the financial arrangement since it wc vas acquired or issued to the end of the previous income year. The amount so calculated shall: (a) Where it is a positive amount, be deemed to be income derived by the holder or the issuer as the case may be: (b) Where it is a negative amount, be deemed to be expenditure incurred by the holder or issuer as the case may be: Provided that expenditure incurred by the holder, in the year in which the financial arrangement is varied, using this method shall not exceed total income derived by the holder in previous income years. 2. In income years after the income year in which the financial arrangement is varied, income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred shall be calculated using the terms of the financial arrangement as varied and the provisions of the Act. 7 Examples 1. Example A (A straight line method) A New Zealand taxpayer issues (borrows) $8,800 on 10 July 1991 for 3 years with interest at 10% pa payable half-yearly in arrears. The loan is made by issuing $10,000 of notes at a discount. There are no fees. The issuer is a New Zealand taxpayer eligible to use the straight line method (Determination G24), and chooses to do so. The issuer has a balance date of 31 March. The total finance charges are: Since the principal outstanding is fixed throughout, and all time units are of the same length, Method A of Determination G24: Straight Line Method was used to calculate expenditure incurred. Accordingly, an amount of 4,200/6 = 700 would be expenditure incurred in each half year period. G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] On 10 July 1993, in consideration of the issuer’s circumstances, the holder agrees to forgive the 5th and 6th interest payments but not the principal amount due. The treatment of the loan in the 1994 and following years is set out below. If the actual cashflows had been known at the outset, namely: then Method B of Determination G24: Straight Line Method would have applied because the length of the periods between payments are unequal. Under that method the Total Finance Charges of 3,200 would be spread over the term of the loan in proportion to the principal outstanding and length of each period. Using the formula in Method B of Determination G24 expenditure of 533.33 would have been incurred for each period. Then using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis, (on a 365 day basis) the position of the lender before and after the variation would be as follows: (1) Expenditure calculated using Method A of Determination G24: Straight Line Method. (2) Expenditure calculated using Method B of Determination G24: Straight Line Method. (3) The number of actual days was used to arrive at the 1992 figure (a broken period plus a leap year), whilst the annual payments were used for the 1993 and 1994 years. (4) Expenditure calculated using this determination where: G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a = 0 b = 774 + 1,067 + 1,067 = 2,908 c = 0 d = 1,016 + 1,400 = 2,416 so a − b − c + d = −492 which being a negative amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the year. In the 1995 income year the expenditure incurred would be calculated using the base price adjustment in section 64F where: a = all consideration paid = 12,000 b = acquisition price = 8,000 c = expenditure incurred in previous years = 2,908 so a − (b + c) = 292, which because it is a positive amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred in terms of section 64F(4)(b)(i). 2. Example B (a zero coupon loan) On 15 April 1991 a 5 year zero coupon bond with a face value of $1,000,000 is issued for $500,000. The lender is a New Zealand taxpayer who balances on 31 March, and uses the yield to maturity method of accounting for financial arrangements. By mutual agreement the debt is varied on 15 April 1993: the borrower repays $250,000, and the face value of the bond is reduced to $600,000. The original yield to maturity is 14.870% pa, so that the income of the lender (the holder) would be as follows: (1) Calculated using the yield to maturity method and a rate of 14.870%. G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If the changed cash flows had been known at 15 April 1991, namely: 15 April 1991 500,000 by lender 15 April 1993 250,000 by borrower 15 April 1996 600,000 by borrower the yield to maturity would have been 14.235% pa and the income would have been as follows: (1) using the yield to maturity method and a rate of 14.235%. (2) 571,175 + 81,307 − 250,000 = 402,482 Then using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis the position of the lender after the variation would be as follows: G25 28 May 1992 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 8 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Notes: (1) Calculated using the Yield to Maturity Method and original cash flows. (2) Calculated using the Yield to Maturity Method and changed cash flows. (3) There are 350 days from 15 April 1993 to 31 March 1994 and 85,406 × 15/365 + 98,106 × 350/365 = 97,584 (4) Similarly, 81,307 × 15/365 + 57,293 × 350/365 = 58,279 (5) Expenditure calculated using this determination where: a = 68,258 + 80,883 + 58,279 = 207,420 b = 0 c = 71,303 + 84,867 = 156,170 d = 0 so a − b − c + d = 51,250 which being a positive amount is deemed to be income derived for the 1994 income year. In the 1997 income year the income derived would be calculated using the base price adjustment in section 64F where: a = all consideration paid to the person = 850,000 b = acquisition price = 500,000 c = income derived in previous income years = 346,935 a − (b + c) = 3,065 which is a positive amount therefore in terms of section 64F(4)(a)(i) it is deemed to be income derived by the holder (lender).

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Variable Rate Financial Arrangements Issued: 22 January 1993 G26 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements”. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. Determination G26 applies to variable rate financial arrangements on which Interest is paid at least annually. Any income or expense relating to a variable rate financial arrangement must be accrued. Determination G26 sets out two alternative methods by which this should be done, and explains the circumstances in which each should be used. A variable rate arrangement may be a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. Floating rate arrangements are those where the Interest rate is reset periodically according to a predetermined formula. The formula links the Interest rate to an indicator rate such as the bank bill or interbank rate. Reviewable rate arrangements are those where the Interest rate is set periodically in line with market rates. Any change in the Interest rate reflects and is consistent with changes in market Interest rates. The most common form of reviewable rate loan is a mortgage where the Interest rate is subject to periodic review by the lender. 2. The income or expense in relation to a variable rate arrangement could consist of: (a) Periodic Interest payments as determined from time to time; (b) A premium or discount on the issue or face value of the arrangement; (c) Fees paid or received in relation to the arrangement. These amounts must be accrued. 3. The methods provided in this determination separately accrue: (a) Periodic Interest on a daily basis over the income year to which it relates; (b) Any discount or premium and fees over the term of the arrangement, on either a straight line basis (Method A) or a yield to maturity basis (Method B). 4. The critical factor in deciding whether Method A or Method B applies to an arrangement is the size of the premium or discount (including fees) relating to the arrangement. (a) Method A applies to financial arrangements where there is a small (or no) discount or premium. These are arrangements where the discount or premium and fees (non-contingent fees with a limit of 2% of the core acquisition price, plus G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] contingent fees) is less than 2% of the average amount of principal outstanding over the term of the arrangement. (For a full definition see clause 5 - Interpretation). (b) Method B is of general application, and may be applied to any variable rate financial arrangement within the scope of this determination. 5. Method A permits the spreading of fees and premium or discount over the term of a financial arrangement on a straight line basis, in proportion to the principal outstanding. The simplest case of Method A occurs where the principal is fixed throughout the term. In that case, the premium or discount and fees are spread on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement. 6. Method B can be applied regardless of the amount of fees and premium or discount. It requires the fees and premium or discount to be spread on a yield to maturity basis. Since the future cashflows are not known, the actual yield to maturity rate cannot be calculated, but must be estimated. This is done by using the initial Interest rate (or price or index) and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. The spreading of fees and premium or discount may be done on either a per Period basis or a per income year basis. To calculate the yield to maturity, Method B uses either Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods and G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. 7. It is important to note that in both Method A and Method B there is no recalculation or respreading of fees and discount or premium, when there is a change in Interest rate, price, or index. The spreading is done only once, at either the date of acquisition or issue as the case may be. 8. Interest is calculated separately for each period (or income year) depending on the actual Interest rate applying in the Period (or the Periods within that income year). 9. A holder of a variable rate financial arrangement to which this determination applies may bring any fees or premium received at the date of issue of the financial arrangement into income at that time. 10. Those taxpayers to whom section 64C(2A) of the Act applies should use Determination G24: Straight Line Method. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976 G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Scope Determination G26 shall be applied to any variable rate financial arrangements where: (a) All of the amounts payable (other than the principal, any discount or premium, and any fees) are either: (i) set periodically according to a predetermined formula. That formula must link the amounts payable to economic, commodity, industrial, or financial indices or prices, or banking rates, or general commercial rates; or (ii) set periodically by reference to market interest rates; and (b) The amounts of principal (including any fees and any premium or discount) and the times or intervals at which they are to be advanced and repaid, are known, or are able to be determined, or can reasonably be anticipated, as at the first balance date after issue or acquisition. (c) Interest is paid at least annually. Determination G26 provides two alternative methods acceptable for the purposes of section 64C(3) of the Act. (NOTE: A determination to which Determination G26 refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination.) 4 Principle 1. The income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in a Period (or income year) is calculated by adding together: (a) The amount of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period (or income year); and (b) The amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or income year). 2. Method A and Method B find and then allocate the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest to each Period (or an income year) of the financial arrangement. Once this amount has been allocated, the amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or income year) is added to it. This gives the income or expenditure for each Period (or income year) of the financial arrangement. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) Method A may only be applied to Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements. It results in an allocation to each Period proportionate to the amount of principal outstanding in that Period, and the length of that Period. (b) Method B may be applied to other financial arrangements. It assumes that the rate, price or index known to apply in the first Period applies to all subsequent Periods. The Act and determinations are used to spread the Total Finance Charges over the term of the financial arrangement. The assumed Interest content of the Total Finance Charges in each Period (or in each income year) is then subtracted. The yield to maturity method or other permissible method would be used for calculation purposes. 5 Interpretation 1. In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act, it shall have the same meaning as in this determination. “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Interest” does not have the meaning given in section 2 of the Act. Rather for the purposes of this determination it means any periodic payment in relation to the financial arrangement, to the extent intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower. It does not include fees, discounts, or premiums, or payments effecting a reduction of principal. “Period” means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable, and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable. Where the Period is longer than one year, the Period is deemed to comprise one or more Periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the holder or issuer as the case may be) by a Period of less than one year. The duration of the financial arrangement should be evenly divided into Periods, which may be measured in days, weeks, fortnights, months, quarters, half years, or years. If an even division is not possible, then the remainder should be treated as a partial Period, and expressed as a fraction of a full Period. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where m = the number of days in the partial Period n = number of full Periods in a year o = number of days in a year For example, if all other Periods are measured in months then a Period of 5 days would be treated as There must be no more than two partial Periods in any financial arrangement. “Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements” means a financial arrangement to which this determination applies, in respect of which— (a) The only variable parts of an amount payable comprise Interest which is: (i) Payable at yearly or more frequent intervals; and (ii) Is calculated on the amount of the principal outstanding from time to time since the previous Interest payment (or since the date of issue or acquisition if that is later); and (b) The amount of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest (ignoring whether it is a positive or negative amount) is not more than the product of: (i) Two per cent; and (ii) The expected term of the financial arrangement calculated in years and fractions of a year; and (iii) The time-weighted average amount of principal that is reasonably expected to be outstanding during the expected term of the financial arrangement. Clause 7 of this determination provides examples which show whether or not a financial arrangement is a Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangement. "Total Finance Charges" in relation to a financial arrangement means— (a) For an issuer, the total of all amounts payable by the issuer less the total of all amounts receivable by the issuer, pursuant to the financial arrangement; G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) For a holder, the total of all amounts receivable by the holder less the total of all amounts payable by the holder, pursuant to a financial arrangement. Any fees payable in relation to the financial arrangement must be reduced by the amount of item z as defined in sections 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act. "Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest" in relation to a financial arrangement means the Total Finance Charges excluding all amounts of Interest payable or receivable. 2. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. 6 Method 1. A person may apply Method A to Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements, and Method B to any other financial arrangement. In order to determine whether Method A can be applied, use the criteria outlined in the Interpretation clause of this determination. 2. Method A shall be applied in respect of Periods. Method B may be applied either in respect of income years or Periods. 3. The proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act allows for another method, similar to those in this determination, to also be used. 4. Once a method has been selected for a financial arrangement, that method must be applied until that financial arrangement matures or is remitted, sold, or otherwise transferred by the person unless the prior consent of the Commissioner to adopt another method is obtained. (The Commissioner's consent may be given conditionally). 5. A person who: (a) is a holder; and (b) who receives a premium or fee on the issue or acquisition of a financial arrangement may elect to include that fee or premium in the income derived by that person in the income year of issue or acquisition. 6. The formula x + y G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] is used to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by a person in a Period (or an income year) in relation to the financial arrangement. In this formula: x is the amount of Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period (or to that income year); and y is the amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or that income year). 7. Method A and Method B differ in the method used to calculate the value of x. (a) Under Method A where, a is the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be; b is the length of the Period (b = 1 if the Period in question is a full Period, or, for a partial Period, b = a fraction calculated in accordance with the formula given in the clause 5 Interpretation); c is the amount of principal outstanding during the Period; d is the sum of all items (b × c) calculated in respect of every Period; (b) Under Method B x = e − f Since, in a variable rate arrangement, the rate, price, or index varies during the term of the arrangement, the assumption is made that the rate, price or index that applies to the first Period after the date of issue or acquisition applies to all Periods of the financial arrangement. Using the assumption: e is the income derived, or the expenditure incurred, for a Period (or income year); and f is the Interest deemed to be payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be. The yield to maturity method is used in accordance with the Act and determinations to decide the value of “e”. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 8. Amounts calculated using this determination should be apportioned between income years using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 7 Examples 1. Example A (illustrating Method A) On 12 February 1991 a company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for 5 years, at an interest rate of bank bill plus 0.75% pa payable half yearly in arrears. The notes are issued at a discount of 5%. The borrower is a New Zealand company. Contingent fees of 2.5% of $10,000 are payable by the borrower; there are no non-contingent fees. There is no change in the principal outstanding over the 5 years. The average principal outstanding is therefore $10,000, both overall and within each half year Period. (a) Before calculating the amount of expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower over the term of the arrangement, it is first necessary to determine whether Method A or Method B is to be used. For Method A to be used, the arrangement must satisfy the criteria for a Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangement (see clause 5 Interpretation). In this example, the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the borrower are calculated as follows: Ignoring sign, $750 is less than the amount which determines whether or not Method A can be used, calculated as follows: 2% × the expected term of the financial arrangement calculated in years and fractions of years (5) × the average principal outstanding ($10,000) 2% × 5 × 10,000 = $1,000 So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b) The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower in a specific Period is calculated using the formula x + y G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (i) x is the amount of Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period. Using Method A where a = the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer or receivable as the case may be; b = the length of the Period = 1 throughout the time of the financial arrangement, as all of the Periods are the same length (half a year) c = the amount of principal outstanding during the Period; = $10,000 in all Periods. d = the sum of all items (b × c) calculated in respect of every Period; = 1 × $10,000 × 10 (as there are 10 half year Periods); = $100,000. (ii) y is the amount of Interest payable or receivable in the Period. Therefore, in this example, y = Interest calculated at the bank bill rate plus 0.75%. (iii) Therefore, the expenditure incurred by the borrower in each half year would be: x + y ($75 + Interest calculated at the bank bill rate plus 0.75%) This expenditure would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have derived similar amounts of income. 2. Example B (a further illustration of Method A) On 12 February 1991 a company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for five years at an interest rate of bank bill plus 0.75% pa payable half yearly in arrears. The notes are issued at a discount of 4.5%. The borrower is a New Zealand company. $2,000 of the face value of the notes is to be repaid on each anniversary of the issue. There are no fees. The length of each Period is measured in half years, so b = 1 throughout. The average principal outstanding over the five years is: (a) Decide whether Method A can be applied. The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the borrower are equal to: Ignoring sign, this is less than: 2% × 5 (years) × 6,000 (average principal outstanding) = $600 So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b) Calculate the value of x The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest: G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (i) y = Interest on the principal outstanding in the half year at the bank bill rate plus 0.75% p.a. (ii) The expenditure incurred by the borrower in each half year Period would be: x (calculated in accordance with the above table) + y This expenditure would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have similar amounts of income. 3. Example C (another illustration of Method A) This is similar to Example B, but issued at a premium, and seen from the holder's viewpoint. It is somewhat artificial, in order to illustrate a point. On 12 February 1991 a company borrows $10,000 for 5 years at an interest rate of bank bill plus 2% p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The money is raised by issuing notes at a premium of 5%. The purchaser is a New Zealand company. Contingent fees of 2% are payable by the issuer to the purchaser (holder). $2,000 of the face value of the notes is to be repaid on each anniversary of the issue. The length of each Period is measured in half years, so b = 1 throughout. The average principal outstanding over the five years is: G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) Decide whether Method A can be applied. The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable to the lender are equal to: So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b) The income deemed to be derived by the holder in a Period is calculated using the formula x + y (i) Calculate the value of x The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest: Note: x is negative because a premium has been paid. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) y = Interest on the principal outstanding in the half year at the bank bill rate plus 2% p.a. (iii) The income derived by the holder in each half year Period would be: x (calculated in accordance with the above table) + y This income would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 4. Example D (illustrating Method B on a Period Basis) This example uses Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. A New Zealand company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for a term of 3 years at a discount of 10% ($1,000). The Interest rate is equal to Libor plus 1% pa, and Interest is payable half yearly in arrears. There are no fees. The Interest rate is 10% in the first Period after issue. Assuming that this interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 14.21% pa, calculated at half yearly rests. (a) Decide whether Method A can be applied. Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest is equal to: Ignoring sign, this is more than: 2% × 3 (years) × 10,000 (average principal outstanding) = $600. Because the Small Discount or Premium criteria are not met, Method A may not be applied. (b) The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower in a Period is equal to x + y. (i) Calculate the value of x (Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period) x = e − f Method B assumes that the Interest rate applying in the first Period (10% in this example) applies throughout the financial arrangement. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] e is the Total Finance Charge. This is calculated using Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (or G10B in conjunction with G11A). The yield to maturity rate is 14.21% pa. (See table for the value of e in each Period.) f is the Interest that would be payable by the borrower if the rate that applied in the first Period after the date of issue applied to all Periods of the financial arrangement. Since the initial Interest rate is 10% in this example, f = 500 for each Period. (ii) y = the actual Interest paid in a Period. Values for this example are shown in the table below. (iii) The expenditure deemed to be incurred in each Period using Method B is calculated in the following table: NOTES: (1) Based on a yield to maturity of 14.21% pa calculated using Determination G3 and an interest rate of 10% pa throughout. (2) 10% is the rate applying in the first Period after issue. Whole dollars and minor adjustments have been made to aid readability. The results still satisfy the requirements of Determination G2: Requirements as to Precision. That Determination allows for the use of results other than those calculated using the Yield to Maturity Method, provided they do not result in a difference of more than $5 per period. The total expenditure is confirmed as: G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (Note: In practice the expenditure in the final income year would be determined using the base price adjustment in section 64F of the Act.) The expenditure for each Period would be apportioned using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have derived similar amounts of income. 5. Example E (illustrating the application of Methods A and B to a reviewable rate loan) A company borrows $1,000,000 for 5 years. The loan will be repaid on a table mortgage basis over the 5 year period with yearly interest reviews. The initial interest rate is 14.5% pa. A fee of $10,000 is charged when the loan is drawn down. The company is a New Zealand taxpayer and the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. For the purposes of this example, the total expenditure incurred has been calculated using both Method A and Method B. (a) Method A The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer equals: Therefore Method A may be applied. The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the issuer is equal to x + y (i) Calculate the value of x. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The following table sets out the cashflows in relation to the arrangement (based on an initial interest rate of 14.5% pa) and the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest to each income year on a straight line basis, as allowed for in Method A. NOTES: (1) Calculated at 14.5% p.a. (2) Figures rounded to nearest whole dollar (3) b = 1, since all Periods are the same length a = 10,000, and d = 3,268,678 throughout the term of the arrangement. (ii) In this case, “y” is the actual Interest paid in a Period. Values for this example are shown in the table below. (iii) The expenditure deemed to be incurred in each Period is shown in the table below. The example assumes that the annual payment is adjusted to reflect the move in Interest rates. Thus the principal outstanding in any period will be as calculated in the table above. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] NOTES: (1) Figures rounded to whole numbers. (2) (i) $1,000,000 (principal outstanding in the first Period) × 14.5% = $145,000 (ii) $850,208 (principal outstanding in the second period) × 13.5% = $114,778 (3) The allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest does not change as the Interest rate changes. (b) Method B This example assumes that the borrower chose to account for all its variable rate financial arrangements using Method B of this Determination. The expenditure deemed to be incurred is calculated using the formula x + y. In Method B, x = e − f. (i) Calculate e. The yield to maturity is calculated as 14.923% pa using Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and the expected cashflows which are as follows: (990,000) principal lent net of fees paid 294,792 annual payments 294,792 annual payments 294,792 annual payments G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 294,792 annual payments 294,792 annual payments The table below shows the values of e for each Period. (ii) Calculate f at an Interest rate of 12.45%, the rate for the first Period. The values for f are shown on the table below. The following table shows the calculation of the expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower. NOTES: (1) Based on the yield to maturity rate of 14.923% pa, calculated using Determination G3 and an Interest rate of 14.5% throughout. (2) At 14.5% pa; this is the same as in the first table in paragraph (a) of this example. (3) Actual Interest payable (y) is calculated on principal outstanding in each Period and is the same as the second table in paragraph (a) above. (4) Figures rounded to whole numbers. 6. Example F (illustrating Method B on an income year basis) Method B may be applied in respect of Periods or income years. In example D and E, Determination G3 was used to calculate the yield to maturity rate, which was then used to calculate e (Total Finance Charges), for each Period. In the present example, G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods is used in conjunction with Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method to calculate the yield to maturity rate and e for each income year. Example F is similar to example D. On 1 March 1992 a New Zealand investor purchases, for $9,000 a 3 year note with a face value of $10,000 maturing 1 March 1995. Interest at Libor plus 1% pa, is payable half yearly in arrears. Fees of 2% of the face value are payable by the borrower to the investor on issue. The investor balances on 31 March and elects to use a 365 day basis. The Interest rate is 10% pa in the first Period after issue. Assuming that this Interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 15.12% pa, calculated at half yearly rests. This allows for the 2% fees, and uses the net purchase price of 9,000 − 200 = 8,800. Income deemed to be derived during an income year is calculated using the formula x + y. (a) Method A of this determination cannot be used because the Small Discount or Premium Criteria are not met. That is, 2% × 3 (years) × 10,000 (average principal outstanding) = 600 which is smaller than the discount plus fees of $1,200. (b) Apply Method B to calculate the value of x. x = e − f The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest (x) between the income years. NOTES: (1) Calculated at 15.12% pa in accordance with Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods. G26 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 21 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (2) Calculated in accordance with Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. In the 1994 income year, for example— Total Finance Charges = (c) In this case, y is the actual Interest paid in a Period. Values for this example are shown in the table below. The income deemed to be derived in each income year will be as follows: The total is confirmed as: (Note: In practice the income in the final year would be determined using the base price adjustment in section 64F of the Act.) If the fees were payable by a borrower who was a New Zealand taxpayer with the same income year end, this taxpayer would be deemed to have incurred similar amounts of expenditure.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Swaps Issued: 16 January 1995 G27 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G27: Swaps”. G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What is a swap? A swap is an agreement to exchange payment streams over a period of time, and these can involve different interest rate types, payment timing or intervals, currencies and/or commodities. However, this determination only applies to an interest rate swap, interest swap, currency swap (sometimes called a cross currency swap) or a swap that is a combination of these, where all payments are expressed in a currency or two different currencies and there is a fixed actual or notional principal agreed or implicit in respect of each side of the swap. This determination does not apply, for example, to commodity swaps, debt-equity swaps, debt-property swaps, swaps involving more than two currencies, or swaps involving the amortisation or accretion of principal. A swap has two sides (or legs). In the case of an interest rate swap, one side relates to the obligations of the parties to make payments of amounts calculated by reference to the fixed rate of interest. The other side of the swap will be those obligations relating to the floating rate of interest. In the case of a currency swap, one side of the swap relates to those obligations expressed in one currency, and the other side of the swap will be those obligations expressed in the other currency. In the case of other types of interest swaps, the sides of the swap reflect the different bases upon which interest is payable. It is not necessary for there to be a physical exchange of principal at the beginning and/or end of the swap, in addition to the interest or other payments during the term of the swap. A swap is a financial arrangement subject to the accrual provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976. This determination sets out the method to be used to calculate income and expenditure under those provisions for swaps to which it applies. What methods can be used to calculate income and expenditure under a swap to which this determination applies? Use A, B, C or D A. A method that has regard to market valuation under section 64C(4) of the Act. This method can be used where your business comprises dealing in swaps, or where the swap constitutes a forward or future contract for foreign exchange. • Where the requirements of section 64C(4) are satisfied, and you choose to use a method under that provision, this determination G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • requires that you adopt a mark to market method, • requires that (so far as possible) you adopt that method in a consistent manner over the term of the swap, and • specifies the markets and sources of information which you must use. B. The method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities. Use this method where the swap involves a spot exchange at the current market spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date and you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4). C. The method provided for in this Determination. Use this method if you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4) and Determination G14 does not apply. This method requires you to • treat the swap as if it comprised two simultaneous loans, one from each party to the other, and • then apply the normal accrual rules to these deemed loans. In this way, the appropriate recognition of income or expenditure under the swap (for income tax purposes) will result from the net effect of the combination of your accounting for the two deemed loans. D. A method that satisfies the requirements of the proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act. You can use this method if it • has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, • conforms with commercially acceptable practice, • (except to the extent that the Commissioner may otherwise allow under section 64C(4A) of the Act) is adopted, and is or will be consistently applied, by you in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes, and • results in the allocation, to each income year, of amounts that are not materially different from the amounts that would be calculated under Method C. How to use Method C Under this method • ignore any offsetting of payments between the parties, so that every amount that would be payable under each side of the swap (if no provision was made for offsetting) is attributed to the relevant deemed loan and taken into account; • treat each side of the swap as a separate loan of the appropriate amount, being the amount that is used to calculate the payments to be made under that side of the swap during its term \[In situations where the swap contract does not provide G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] for the Principal Amount relating to each side of the swap to be both paid on the Effective Date and repaid on the Maturity Date, this Determination treats such payment and repayment as taking place, by specifying the actual and deemed cash flows that are to be taken into account in the calculation of each party's income or expenditure under each side of the swap\]; • take into account, as cash flows subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or relevant determinations, fees payable in relation to the swap that qualify as Fee Amounts (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act), any payment made that is intended to compensate one of the parties for a difference in the values of the anticipated cash flows under the swap, and any consideration paid in connection with the assignment of a swap by or to an assignee \[Apply each of them to only one of the two loans that the swap is deemed to comprise. You must elect which of the loans is to be treated in this way.\]; • then, calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by you for each of these deemed loans by applying the accrual provisions of the Act and determinations that would be applicable to such cash flows; • where the relevant deemed loan is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars and the swap does not provide for any actual payment of principal on the Maturity Date, and you are applying Determination G9A in calculating the income or expenditure, ignore any actual or deemed payments of principal on the Effective Date when applying Determination G9A (except for the calculation of base currency income and expenditure). \[This is to ensure that the calculations do not take account of fluctuations in the New Zealand dollar value of principal amounts denominated in the other currency where there is no actual repayment of principal.\] How are the parties to a swap described? According to the definition in the Act, each party is a “holder” in relation to the swap. However, since the swap is treated as if it comprised two simultaneous loans, each party will be a “holder” and an “issuer” for the purposes of the calculations under this Determination. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the swap matures or is disposed of? Calculate income or expenditure under the base price adjustment described in section 64F of the Act. Make that adjustment in relation to the swap as a whole, and treat each party as a “holder”. G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (d) of section 64E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope of Determination This determination applies to any arrangement that is an Interest Rate Swap, Interest Swap, Currency Swap, Interest Rate and Currency Swap, or Interest and Currency Swap entered into after the date upon which this determination is published in the New Zealand Gazette (except where it was entered into pursuant to a binding contract entered into before that date), where (a) all payments under the swap are expressed in a currency or two (but not more than two) different currencies; and (b) either— (i) a notional or actual principal is specified in the swap contract in relation to each side of the swap; or (ii) a notional principal is implicit in the computation of the cash flows payable by the parties in relation to each side of the swap, and (c) the Principal Amount relating to each side of the swap is fixed in terms of the relevant currency; and (d) there are no payments made, or to be made, under or in relation to the swap other than payments that are (i) actual payments of the Principal Amount made on either or both of the Effective Date and the Maturity Date that form part of a Principal Exchange; (ii) payments made during the term of the swap of amounts calculated by applying the Agreed Rate to the Principal Amount; (iii) a payment made on the Effective Date of any Compensatory Amount; (iv) a payment made on the Effective Date of any Fee Amount that is less than the Principal Amount; or (v) a combination of any two or more of the payments referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iv) above. G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 Principle 1. Subject to sub-clauses 4(3) and 4(5) below, if you are a party to a swap to which this Determination applies, calculate income derived or expenditure incurred as if each side of the swap was a separate, simultaneous and mutual loan between you and the other party. Then apply the accrual provisions of the Act and determinations that would be applicable to such loans to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred by you. 2. Take fees payable in relation to the swap that qualify as Fee Amounts (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act) into account as cash flows subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or determinations made thereunder. Apply them to either one of the two loans the swap is deemed to comprise, at your option. Accord the same treatment to any payment made by one party to the swap to the other that is intended to compensate the latter for a difference in the values of the anticipated cash flows under the swap, and to any consideration paid in connection with the assignment of the swap by or to the assignee. 3. If your business comprises dealing in swaps, or if you are a party to a swap that constitutes a forward or future contract for foreign exchange, you may use a mark to market method to calculate the income derived or expenditure incurred under a relevant swap provided that the requirements of section 64C(4) of the Act are satisfied. 4. For the purposes of sub-clause 4(3) above, a mark to market method is one that reflects the revaluation of the swap at its current market value. You must compute such market value by reference to or by interpolation from one or more rates or yields, published electronically by Reuters New Zealand Limited or Telerate New Zealand Limited on the relevant date, that are (a) relevant (as regards quality, term and currency) to the particular swap or the relevant side of it; and (b) quoted with respect to markets that have been approved by the Commissioner by Determination. 5. If you are a party to a swap that involves a spot exchange at the current spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date, and you do not use a mark to market method under section 64C(4), use the method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts For Foreign Exchange And Commodities.

A determination to which this Determination refers may be varied, rescinded, restricted or extended by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, the reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. 6 Method 1. If you may adopt a method that has regard to market valuation to calculate income and expenditure in respect of a swap pursuant to section 64C(4) of the Act, and you choose to do so, you must use a mark to market method. That method must also satisfy the requirements of section 64C(4) of the Act. For these purposes, this Determination approves the use of any rates or yields quoted with respect to markets that have been approved by the Commissioner by determination, and approves the use of any sources of information that have been approved by the Commissioner by determination. If you have adopted such a method for calculating the income or expenditure in respect of a swap in one income year, you must, so far as is possible, apply that method consistently, and having regard to the same published rates and yields, for subsequent income years over the term of the swap, unless the Commissioner otherwise allows. 2. If you are a party to a swap that involves a spot exchange at the current spot rate and a future exchange of fixed amounts at a single fixed date, and you do not use a mark to market method under section 64C(4), you must use the method specified in Determination G14: Forward Contracts For Foreign Exchange And Commodities. 3. If you are a party to a swap to which this Determination applies and Determination G14 does not apply, and you do not adopt a method under section 64C(4), you must (unless the proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act applies) calculate income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by you as if each side of the swap comprised a separate, simultaneous and mutual loan between the parties to the swap. Each of the loans is to be characterised and treated according to the principles outlined in sub-clauses 6(4) to (7) below. 4. If the terms of the swap provide for the netting off or offsetting of any amounts payable to or by one party to the swap with any amounts payable to or by the other G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] party to the swap, ignore such netting off or offsetting for the purposes of sub-clauses 6(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this Determination. 5. Subject to sub-clause 6(4) above, treat the deemed loans referred to in sub-clause 6(3) above relating to each side of the swap as comprising the following cash flows: (a) Where the terms of the swap provide for both the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, and the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (b) Where the terms of the swap provide for the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, and no payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (c) Where the terms of the swap provide for no payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, but a payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) the payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all other amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. (d) Where the terms of the swap do not provide for the payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower on the Effective Date, or for payment of the Principal Amount by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date, (i) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Lender to the Deemed Borrower, on the Effective Date; (ii) a deemed payment of the Principal Amount made by the Deemed Borrower to the Deemed Lender on the Maturity Date; and (iii) payments of all amounts that are payable by either party to the other under the terms of the swap contract, and that relate to the relevant side of the swap, on the dates on which they are specified to be payable in the swap contract. 6. Subject to sub-clause 6(4) above, apply the following provisions for the purpose of calculating the income derived and expenditure incurred by a party to a swap: (a) Subject to paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below, apply the accrual provisions and any relevant determinations to each of the deemed loans described in sub-clause 6(5) above. (b) Although both parties to the swap will be “holders” under the swap, in relation to each of the deemed loans treat a party as either a “holder” or an “issuer” in accordance with the terms of the loan (as described in sub-clause 6(5) above) and the definitions of “holder” and “issuer” in section 64B. (c) Where (i) a deemed loan is denominated in a currency other than New Zealand Dollars and Determination G9A would be applied to calculate the income and expenditure under the deemed loan, and (ii) there is no actual payment of the Principal Amount on the Maturity Date, and G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (iii) either paragraph (b) or paragraph (d) of sub-clause 6(5) of this Determination applies to deem amounts to be paid or payable on the Maturity Date, then \[notwithstanding the requirements of Determination G9A and the terms of paragraphs (b) and (d) of sub-clause 6(5) of this Determination\] apply Determination G9A, in respect of that deemed loan, on the basis that any actual or deemed payment of the Principal Amount on the Effective Date is not included as “consideration given” for the purposes of items b and d in the formula contained in sub-clause 6(1) of that Determination G9A and items f and h in the meaning of “closing tax book value” in clause 5 of that Determination. (d) Take into account any Fee Amount payable in relation to the swap (reduced by the amount of item z in section 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act), any Compensatory Amount payable, and any Assignment Amount payable to or by a party as the assignee of the swap, as an amount or amounts subject to the yield to maturity or other method of calculating income or expenditure applicable under the accrual provisions or determinations made thereunder. However, apply each such amount to only one of the two loans the swap is deemed to comprise. You must elect which of the loans is to be treated in this way. 7. Where the terms of a swap are varied after the date it was entered into, and that variation alters the amounts payable (or the basis upon which the amounts payable are to be calculated) under the swap, or the dates upon which they are payable, apply Determination G25: Variations In The Terms of a Financial Arrangement (in combination with this determination) as if the corresponding variation and alterations occurred with respect to the deemed loans described in sub-clause 6(5) above. 7 Examples 1. Example 1 — Deemed Loans Background Information This example illustrates the method outlined in sub-clause 6(3) of this determination. The swap is treated as if it comprised two simultaneous loans from each party to the other. Income derived or expenditure incurred is then calculated in accordance with the Act and relevant determinations. In this example, there is a three year interest rate and currency swap from 15 September 1993 to 15 September 1996 between— G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) a New Zealand corporate borrower who has arranged a floating loan in United States dollars, with interest at LIBOR plus a margin, payable semi-annually on 15 March and 15 September, and (b) a counterparty who has a fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars, with interest at 12.5% payable semi-annually on 15 March and 15 September. The swap involves the LIBOR interest only, not the margin. Draw down of both loans occur on 15 September 1993. There are no fees. If the New Zealand dollar amount is $20 million and the spot rate on 15 September 1993 is 0.5900, then the cash flows of the two parties before the swap are as follows— The notional principal specified in the swap contract is $NZ20.00 million = $US11.80 million as at the starting date, since these have the same value. There is no exchange of principal on that date. Deemed Cash Flows for the Corporate under the Swap Under the swap, the cash flows for the corporate (for the purposes of applying this determination) are as follows: G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where brackets denote payments by the corporate to the swap counterparty. Accrual Calculations Therefore, in determining its assessable income, the corporate would, using a Yield to Maturity or other method acceptable under the Act and the determinations, calculate: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (this could be done by Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, or Determinations G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods and G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method); and (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (this could be done using Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements, Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements That Are Denominated In A Currency Or Commodity Other Than New Zealand Dollars, and Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates). The corporate remains responsible for settling its floating rate US dollar based loan with the original lender, and for the margin above LIBOR. If the original borrowings were already in existence on 15 September 1993, the analysis would be the same. Again, no payments would need to be made between the corporate and the swap counterparty on that date, but a notional principal is still required to calculate the floating rate interest amounts, and this principal would be used in the two notional loans. Final Calculation To calculate income or expenditure for the final year of the arrangement, the base price adjustment (described in section 64F of the Act) must be applied. The formula is a − (b + c). In making the base price adjustment at 31 March 1997, both parties are G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] considered to be “holders”. The corporate would bring into account the following items (assuming no exchange of principal on 15 September 1993)— 2. Example 2 — Deemed Loans and a Fee Payment Background Information To illustrate the allocation of a fee payment, it will be assumed that, in the example of sub-clause 7(1), the corporate pays fees of 30BP contingent upon the implementation of the swap, and that the corporate wishes to pay interest in advance in relation to a loan in New Zealand dollars. Deemed Cash Flows for the Corporate under the Swap Therefore, under the swap, the cash flows for the corporate (for the purposes of applying this determination) are as follows: G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where brackets denote payment by the corporate to the swap counterparty. Accrual Calculations In determining its assessable income, the corporate must take into account the fees paid and allocate them to one of the loans. If the fees are treated by the corporate as being attached to the US dollar loan, they may be spread on a straight-line basis over the three years under method A of Determination G26. If, on the other hand, the fees were allocated to the NZ dollar loan, they would be spread using a yield to maturity method acceptable under the Act. In addition, the same methods outlined in sub-clause 7(1) would be used to determine: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (for example, Determination G3, or Determinations G10B and G11A — under these methods the $5.5 million will be spread over the term of the swap); and (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (for example, Determinations G26, G9A and G6D). 3. Example 3 — Assigning a Swap Background Information The situation where a party assigns a swap can be considered by assuming that, in the example in sub-clause 7(1), the corporate (“corporate A”) assigned the swap to another corporate (“corporate B”) for consideration of $250,000 on 31 December 1994. Final Calculation for the Assignor In such a case, corporate A would apply the base price adjustment in the 1995 income year. Therefore, corporate A would bring into account the following items (assuming no exchange of principal on 15 September 1993)— G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The formula is a − (b + c) and if the result is positive it will be income derived by the corporate. If the result is negative the amount is an allowable deduction. Deemed Cash Flows for the Assignee Under the swap, the cash flows for the assignee, corporate B (for the purposes of applying this determination) are as follows: where brackets denote payments by the Corporate B to the swap counterparty. The assignment fee was allocated to the NZ dollar loan. Accrual Calculations for the Assignee Therefore, in determining its assessable income for the years ended 31 March 1995 and 1996, corporate B would, using a Yield to Maturity or other method acceptable under the Act and the determinations, calculate: (i) expenditure under the fixed rate loan in New Zealand dollars (this could be done by Determination G3, or Determinations G10B and G11A, resulting in the spreading of the $250,000 assignment consideration over the remaining term of the swap); and G27 16 January 1995 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 18 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) income under the floating rate loan in United States dollars (this could be done using Determinations G26 and G9A, and G6D). Final Calculation for the Assignee To calculate income or expenditure for the final year of the arrangement (ending 31 March 1997) the base price adjustment must be applied. Corporate B would bring to account the following items: Under the formula described in section 64F of the Act, the exchange variation on the principal sums included in the assignee's base price adjustment will be the total movement from the initial date of the swap until maturity. That is, any exchange variation prior to the assignment is taken into account. It is assumed that the effect would be included in any assignment fee paid or received by the assignee.

All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure Issued: 27 September 1996 G29 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure”. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) What financial arrangements does this determination apply to? 1. This determination applies to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property (or “ASAP”) which is subject to the accrual rules, if the price for the property is denominated in a foreign currency (a “foreign currency ASAP”), and certain other conditions are met. It does not apply to a short term ASAP or a private or domestic ASAP (as those terms are defined in the Act), because these agreements are excepted financial arrangements. General Principles of taxation of foreign currency ASAPs 2. For all ASAPs (whether or not denominated in a foreign currency) which are subject to the accrual rules, you must calculate a core acquisition price. This is the total of: (a) the lowest price that you and the other party would have agreed upon for the property at the time the ASAP was entered into, on the basis of payment in full at the time the first right in the specified property is to be transferred; or if there is no such lowest price, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property, calculated in accordance with Determination G21A; and (b) any other amounts paid by the seller to the buyer (for purposes of explanation, these can safely be ignored). 3. The difference, if any, between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price (plus or minus certain non-contingent fees) and the NZ$ value of the amount paid by the buyer to the seller (the price) is income or expenditure, under the accrual rules. This difference may arise for a number of reasons: (a) In the case of an ASAP where the price is fixed in NZ$, the reason for this difference will generally be the time value of money. If the buyer pays in advance for the goods, the buyer will often require a discount from the cash price. If the buyer pays on a deferred basis, the seller will often require an additional amount as compensation for the deferral. This can be equivalent to: • a loan from the buyer to the seller in the case of a pre-payment, with the discount to the purchase price representing interest payable by the seller; or G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • a loan from the seller to the buyer in the case of a deferred settlement, with the additional amount required by the seller representing interest payable by the buyer. (b) In the case of a foreign currency ASAP, there can be another reason for the difference between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price and the NZ$ value of the price paid by the buyer to the seller. That is that different exchange rates could be used to convert these amounts into NZ$. The price must be converted into NZ$ using the spot exchange rate on payment date, while the core acquisition price is converted into NZ$ using the forward exchange rate from the contract date to either the date of payment or the date of transfer of the property. If the exchange rates are different, then there will be a difference between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price and the NZ$ value of the price, even if the amounts are identical when determined in the foreign currency. 4. Regardless of why it arises, this difference will be recognised: • under section EH 1(5) of the Act, if you are a party to the ASAP at the end of an income year, by way of an allocation of income or expenditure to that income year; • under the base price adjustment in section EH 4 of the Act, when the ASAP matures or is transferred by you. 5. Section OB 7(1) deals with the calculation of the core acquisition price in the case of a foreign currency ASAP. It provides that the lowest price is the lowest price the parties would have agreed to in the foreign currency, converted into NZ$ using: • the forward exchange rate, on the contract date, for exchange of the foreign currency into NZ$ on the rights date (this is the date on which first rights in the property pass to the buyer, and will often be the date on which goods are delivered) under the foreign currency ASAP (Rate A); or • the forward exchange rate, on the contract date, for exchange of the foreign currency into NZ$ on the final payment date under the foreign currency ASAP (Rate B); or • such other rate as is approved by the Commissioner by determination. What this determination does 6. This determination approves the adoption of three alternative exchange rates for converting the foreign currency lowest price into NZ$. This is in accordance with paragraph (c) of section OB 7(1) (which clarifies the calculation of the “core acquisition G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] price” in the case of a foreign currency ASAP) and section 90(1)(k) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination also prescribes the method you must use to calculate income or expenditure from a foreign currency ASAP under section EH 1(5). The method you must use depends on the exchange rate you have used. The rates approved by this determination are: • Spot rate on the rights date (Rate C). The effect of using this rate is that currency fluctuations between the rights date and the payment date will give rise to income or expenditure under the accrual rules. This rate can only be used for ASAPs which are for trading stock (excluding land or shares). If you use this rate you must apply Method C to calculate income or expenditure from the ASAP under section EH 1(5). • Spot rate on the contract date (Rate D). The effect of using this rate is that currency fluctuations between the contract date (the date on which you enter into the ASAP) and the payment date will give rise to income or expenditure under the accrual rules. This rate can only be used for ASAPs which are for trading stock (excluding land or shares). If you use this rate you must apply Method D to calculate income or expenditure from the ASAP under section EH 1(5). • Spot rate on payment date (Rate E). The effect of using this rate is to ensure that foreign currency fluctuations do not give rise to accrual income or expenditure under the foreign currency ASAP. You can only use Rate E if your annual gross income is less than $2,500,000 in the income year you become a party to the ASAP. In calculating that amount, you should exclude income from foreign currency ASAPs not completed at balance date. As an anti-avoidance measure, in calculating the $2,500,000 you must also take into account the annual gross income of associated persons. If you use this rate you must apply Method E to calculate income or expenditure from the ASAP under section EH 1(5). 7. The NZ$ value of the foreign currency lowest price is also the price at which the property is deemed to have been sold or acquired by you for income tax purposes (under section EH 8(2)). If you use Rate E and Method E, you may have to convert the relevant payments into NZ$ using the spot rate at the first balance date following acquisition of the property. This ensures that the price can be established in the year the property is transferred to you. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Reference This determination is made under paragraphs (c) and (k) of section 90(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope General 1. Subject to (3), (4) and (5) below, this determination applies to the calculation of income or expenditure under any foreign currency ASAP with respect to which you either: • become a party in your 1996–97 income year or a subsequent income year; or • calculate the core acquisition price using section OB 7(1)(a), (b) or (c), under section EZ 10(2). 2. Method A is available to all taxpayers for all foreign currency ASAPs if they use Rate A. 3. Method B is available to all taxpayers who use Rate B, which may only be used if the period between the rights date and the settlement date (date of final payment) is not more than five years. 4. Rates C and D, and Methods C and D You may use rates C or D, and Methods C or D only if the property that is the subject of the ASAP is trading stock in relation to you, other than land or shares. 5. Rate E and Method E You may apply Rate E and Method E only if the aggregate of your gross income (as defined in the Act) and that of all associated persons, in the income year you became a party to the foreign currency ASAP, does not exceed $2,500,000. For this purpose, gross income should be adjusted by excluding any income from foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to section EH 1 in the income year. 6. Where both this determination and Determination G9A could apply to an ASAP, you should apply this determination, and not Determination G9A to the ASAP. You may however apply G9A to a loan which is part of the ASAP (see paragraph 6(4)). G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4 Principle 1. Under the qualified accrual rules a foreign currency ASAP gives rise to income or expenditure equal to the difference between the NZ$ value of the acquisition price of the ASAP and the NZ$ value of the price. 2. The acquisition price is equal to the core acquisition price, less (in the case of the holder) or plus (in the case of the issuer) any non-contingent fees paid by that party that qualify as item z in the definition of acquisition price in section OB 1. 3. The core acquisition price is defined in section OB 1. The main component of the core acquisition price is, broadly, the lowest price the parties would have agreed upon, assuming payment in full at the time of delivery. You should refer to the detailed definition of core acquisition price contained in the Act. 4. In the case of a foreign currency ASAP, the lowest price is denominated in a foreign currency, and must be converted into NZ$. Section OB 7 allows the use of two forward rates, Rates A and B (contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section OB 7(1) and described in paragraph 1(5) of this determination), but not all taxpayers will wish to use forward rates. This determination approves the use of the spot rate on certain alternative dates. 5. If you are a party to an ASAP you will have to determine the lowest price, using either one of the statutory rates, or one of the rates prescribed by this determination. You will then have to spread any income or expenditure arising from the ASAP using the method described in this determination which is applicable to the rate you are using. 5 Interpretation In this determination: 1. a reference to the “Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. 2. “ASAP” means an agreement for sale and purchase of property which is subject to the accrual rules; “Contract date” means the date on which the foreign currency ASAP was entered into; “Foreign currency ASAP” means an ASAP under which the price for the property the subject of the ASAP is denominated in foreign currency; “Forward rate” means the rate for a forward contract as defined in paragraph 6(4) of Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] “Lowest price” is the lowest price referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of “core acquisition price”; “Payment date” means a date on which any part of the price for the property transferred under an ASAP is paid by the buyer; “Price” means the foreign currency price agreed to be paid in consideration for the property under an ASAP, including any agreed interest charges; “Rights date” is the day on which the first right in the specified property subject to an ASAP is to be transferred; “Settlement date” means the day on which final payment is to be made under the financial arrangement; “Spot rate” means the rate for a spot contract as defined in paragraph 6(3) Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates. 3. all other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. As an aid to interpretation only, and not as a definitive list, the following are the terms defined in the Act that are of particular note: right in the specified property, trading stock, associated persons, agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 6 Rate and method – general 1. All the methods approved by this determination require you to treat yourself as a party to a foreign currency loan or loans. The nature of the foreign currency loan or loans is set out in paragraphs (2) to (4). 2. To the extent that the price is paid before the rights date, treat yourself as a party to a loan: • from the buyer to the seller: • of an amount equal to the amount of the price paid before the rights date; • advanced on the date the amounts are paid; • repaid on the rights date; • with a repayment amount equal to the amount of the lowest price, less any amount paid on the rights date, and less the amount attributable to the advance under any loan referred to in (3). G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3. To the extent that the price is paid after the rights date, treat yourself as a party to a loan: • from the seller to the buyer; • of an amount equal to the lowest price, less any amount paid on the rights date, and less any amount attributable to the repayment of any loan referred to in (2); • advanced on the rights date; • repaid on the payment date or payment dates occurring after the rights date; • with a repayment amount equal to the price, less any amount paid on or before the rights date. 4. In many cases you may be able to apply Determination G9A to the loan. 7 Method A – forward rate to rights date 1. If you adopt method A you must use Rate A to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. 2. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by applying an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in “Method — General”. Also take into account, as income or expenditure in any year up to and including the year in which the rights date occurs, the amount a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using either (i) if the rights date is after the end of the year, the forward rate from the last day of the relevant income year to the rights date; (ii) in any other case, the spot rate on rights date. b is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the forward rate to the rights date from whichever is the later of: (i) the last day of the previous income year; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) the contract date. using a reasonable estimate of the rights date at that time (unless a(ii) applies). 3. If a − b is a negative, this amount will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a − b is a positive, the amount will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 8 Method B – forward rate to settlement date 1. If you adopt method B, you must use Rate B to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. 2. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by applying an available method under the qualified accruals rules to calculate the foreign currency income or expenditure you would have if you were party to a foreign currency loan or loans as set out above in “Method — General”. 3. In calculating this income or expenditure, treat the foreign currency loan or loans as if they were in NZ$. In particular, do not apply Determination G9A to the loan contract. Then convert the foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on the payment date. If there is more than one payment date, use the weighted average of the spot rates. For payment dates occurring after the last day of the year, use the spot rate on that day. 4. Also take into account as income or expenditure in any year up to and including the year in which the settlement date occurs, the amount a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using either (i) if the settlement date is after the end of the year, the forward rate from the last day of the relevant income year to the settlement date; (ii) in any other case, the spot rate on settlement date. b is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the forward rate to the settlement date from whichever is the later of: (i) the last day of the previous income year; (ii) the contract date. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] using a reasonable estimate of the settlement date at that time (unless a(ii) applies). 5. If a − b is a negative, this amount will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a − b is a positive, the amount will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 9 Rate C and method C – spot rate at rights date 1. If you adopt Method C, you must use rate C to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. 2. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by applying an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in “Method — General”. 3. Because you are using the spot rate at rights date to convert the foreign currency core acquisition price to NZ$, you will not have any income or expenditure for tax purposes in the period between the contract date and the earlier of the rights date or the first payment date. 10 Rate D and method D – spot rate at contract date 1. If you adopt Method D, you must use Rate D to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. 2. If you adopt Method D, then even if there is no difference between the foreign currency price and the foreign currency lowest price, you will have income/expenditure if there is a change in the spot rate from the contract date to the payment date. 3. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the Foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by applying an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in “Method — General”. 4. Because you are using the spot rate at contract date to convert the foreign currency core acquisition price to NZ$, you must take into account as income or expenditure, in any year up to and including the year in which the rights date occurs, the amount a − b G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where: a is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the spot rate on the earlier of the last day of the relevant income year and the rights date b is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the spot rate on whichever is the later of the last day of the previous income year and the contract date. 5. If a − b is negative, this will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a − b is positive, this will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 11 Rate E and method E – spot rate at payment date 1. If you adopt Method E, you must use Rate E to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price, subject to (2)(ii) below. If there is more than one payment date, you must use the weighted average of the spot rates on the payment dates. 2. If you need to know the NZ$ price of the property for the purpose of calculating your assessable income for an income year (other than under the qualified accrual rules), and any payments under the foreign currency ASAP are made after the end of the relevant year, you must determine the NZ$ value of the lowest price by converting those payments into NZ$ at either: (i) the spot rate on the payment date if the agreement is completed before you are required to file your income tax return for the relevant year, and you elect to use that rate; or (ii) the spot rate on the last day of the relevant year. 3. If you choose to use Method E, and if there is no difference between the foreign currency price and the foreign currency lowest price (plus any amount comprised in item x in the core acquisition price definition), you will have no income or expenditure under the qualified accruals rules from the foreign currency ASAP (unless paragraph 2(ii) applies). 4. In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure from the ASAP as the result of a − b − c where: G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a is the NZ$ value of the price. Determine this NZ$ value by converting the price into NZ$ using the spot rate on the payment date or payment dates. Convert any payments required to be made after the end of the year: at the spot rate on the last day of the year; or if the agreement matures before the date on which you must file your tax return for the year, at the spot rate on the relevant payment date, if you elect to use that rate; b is the NZ$ value of the lowest price. Determine this NZ$ value by converting the lowest price into NZ$ using the spot rate used to calculate “a”, or the weighted average of the spot rates if there is more than one payment date. However, if you have taken the cost of the property into account in calculating your assessable income (other than under the qualified accrual rules) in a previous income year, you must calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price using the same exchange rate used to calculate the lowest price in that previous income year. c is the NZ$ value of the unaccrued difference between the price and lowest price, calculated in accordance with paragraph (6). 5. If the result of the calculation in paragraph (4) is positive, that amount will be income if you are the seller of the property and expenditure if you are the buyer. If the result is negative, the amount will be income if you are the buyer of the property and expenditure if you are the seller. 6. “c” in paragraph (4) is calculated as follows: Apply an available method under the accrual rules to calculate the foreign currency income or expenditure you would have if you were a party to a foreign currency loan or loans as set out above in “Rate and Method — General”. In calculating this expenditure, treat the foreign currency loan or loans as if they were in NZ$. In particular, do not apply Determination G9A to the loan contract; Convert this foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the exchange rate used to calculate “a” in paragraph (4). 12 Example 1. A US resident agrees to sell a quantity of plate glass to a New Zealand resident glass wholesaler for US$140,000. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the glass is landed in Auckland, and will remain the seller's risk until it is landed. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The parties also agree that if the price were paid at the time the glass is landed, the price would be US$130,000. 2. The New Zealand resident wholesaler must calculate the “lowest price” by converting the US$130,000 to NZ$ using one of the rates set out in section OB 7(1) of the Act, or in this determination. The difference between that amount in NZ$, and US$140,000 at the spot rate on payment date, will be income or expenditure to the New Zealand resident. It must then apply the appropriate method to spread that income or expenditure over the life of the ASAP. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 1: Purchase of a motor vehicle: payment in arrears and 10% deposit Calculation of a lowest price by buyer for section EH 4 using various rates and methods This is a simple example of a Foreign Currency ASAP with a deposit, payment in arrears, and no charge for the deferral of the payment. It shows the different results that will arise under the base price adjustment (section EH 4), using Rates C, D and E to calculate the core acquisition price. It also shows how Method E would apply to the calculation of income/expenditure from the arrangement. 1.1 On 1 February 1997 a NZ resident with a 31 March balance date agrees to purchase a motor vehicle from a US resident for US$14,000. The buyer pays a deposit of US$1,400 on 1 February 1997. The Rights Date will be 15 March 1997, when the vehicle is delivered to the buyer in Los Angeles. The final payment of US$12,600 does not have to be made until 15 September 1997. The price that the buyer would have had to pay for a cash sale is US$14,000. The car is acquired for business use. 1.2 The US$/NZ$ exchange rates for the various dates are: 1 February 1997 0.5600 15 March 1997 0.5500 31 March 1997 0.5300 15 September 1997 0.5700 1.3 This fact situation can be represented diagrammatically as follows: G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Rate and Method C 1.4 If the buyer applies Rate C, the NZ$ Lowest Price will be the US$14,000 Lowest Price converted into NZ$ at the spot exchange rate on the Rights Date, ie. which is $25,454. 1.5 Leaving aside any income or expenditure that might be recognised by the buyer under the accrual rules in the 1997 year, the base price adjustment in the 1998 year would be: $24,605 − $25,454 = ($849). This would be income to the buyer. Rate and Method D 1.6 If the buyer applies Rate D, the NZ$ Lowest Price will be the US$14,000 Lowest Price converted into NZ$ at the spot exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. which is NZ$25,000. 1.7 Leaving aside any income or expenditure that might be recognized by the buyer under the accrual rules in the 1997 year, the base price adjustment in the 1998 year would be: $24,605 − $25,000 = ($395). This would be income to the buyer. Rate and Method E 1.8 If the buyer applies Rate E to calculate the NZ$ Lowest Price, it must apply Method E to calculate its income/expenditure from the Foreign Currency ASAP in the 1997 year. Method E requires it to calculate the result of the formula: a − b − c where a is the NZ$ value of the price. This is the total of: G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (a) US$1,400/.56 = $2,500; (b) US$12,600/.53 = $23,774. The buyer uses the spot rate on balance date to convert the final payment, because it is required to file its tax return for the 1997 tax year before the agreement is completed. “a” is therefore $2,500 + $23,774 = $26,274; b is the Lowest Price converted into NZ$ using the weighted average of the spot rates used to calculate “a”. The weighted average is: which is .53285. “b” is therefore US$14,000/.53285 = $26,274; c is the unaccrued interest, treating the agreement as two US$ loans as follows: (a) a loan (i) from the buyer to the seller; (ii) advanced on 1 February 1997 (the Contract Date); (iii) of US$1,400; (iv) repaid on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (v) with a payment of $ 1,400. (b) a loan (i) from the seller to the buyer; (ii) advanced on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (iii) of US$12,600; (iv) repaid on 15 September 1997 (the date of the second payment); (v) with a repayment amount of US$12,600. The buyer must calculate its income from this arrangement in US$, and then convert it into NZ$ using the same rate used to calculate “a”. Because the US$ amount paid by the purchaser is the same as the US$ Lowest Price, the buyer has no unaccrued income or expenditure from the notional loans in the income year ended 31 March 1997. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1.9 The result of Method E is therefore $26,274 − $26,274 − 0 = 0. The buyer has no income or expenditure under section EH 1 in the 1997 year. 1.10 In the income year ended 31 March 1998, the buyer applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the issuer. This is the US$ price of the vehicle, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This will be: (i) in relation to the deposit, US$1.400/.56 = $2.500 (ii) in relation to the final payment, US$12,600/.57 = $22,105 giving a total of $24,605; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using the weighted average Spot Rate on the Payment Dates. The weighted average spot rate is: which is .5690. The acquisition price is therefore $24.605; c = expenditure already recognised, of 0. The base price adjustment is therefore $24,605 − $24,605 = 0. Example 2: Payment in arrears; charge for deferral Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various methods and rates This example involves deferred payment with a charge being made for the deferral. It shows how Rates and Methods A to D would apply to calculate the buyer's income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 2.1 On 1 February 1997 a US resident agrees to sell a quantity of plate glass to a NZ resident glass wholesaler for US$140,000. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the date the glass is landed in Auckland, which is expected to occur on 1 March. The glass will be at the seller's risk until it is landed in Auckland. The date it is landed will be the Rights Date. If payment were made at that time, the price would be US$130,000. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2.2 The glass is unloaded in Auckland on 15 March 1997. Therefore the term of the arrangement is 1 February 1997 to 15 September 1997 — 226 days. The purchaser's balance date is 30 June. The US$/NZ$ spot and forward exchange rates for the various dates are The purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules. 2.3 This transaction can be represented diagrammatically as follows: General 2.4 Whichever method the purchaser decides to use, it will have to treat itself as party to a notional foreign currency loan: (a) from the seller to the buyer; (b) advanced on 15 March (the Rights Date); (c) of an amount equal to the Lowest Price of US$130,000; (d) repaid on 15 September (the payment date); (e) with a repayment amount of US$140.000. Rate and Method A 2.5 If the purchaser applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the glass using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2.6 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses Determination G9A. 2.7 Under Determination G9A, income or expenditure will be: a + b − c − d where a is the value in NZ$ of the closing tax book value, using the spot rate at balance date; and b is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given; and c is the value in NZ$ of the opening tax book value, using the spot rate at the start of the year; and d is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given. 2.8 The closing tax book value is calculated as follows: e + f + g − h − i where e is— (i) the opening tax book value at the beginning of the period, if the person was a party to the arrangement at that time; and (ii) in every other case, nil; and f is the sum of the US$ value of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement; and g is the purchaser's US$ income in respect of the financial arrangement during the year; and h is the sum of the US$ value of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement; and G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] i is the US$ expenditure of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement. 2.9 In this case: (a) “e”, “f” and “g” are zero; (b) “h” is the amount advanced under the notional loan, ie. US$130,000; (c) to calculate “i”, the purchaser allocates the US$10,000 of expenditure over the period on a straight line basis. For the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (107/184) × US$10,000 − US$5,815. The closing book value of the financial arrangement is therefore (US$135,815). 2.10 To calculate “a” in the formula, the purchaser converts this closing tax book value into NZ$ using the spot rate on the balance date. This gives a figure of (US$ 135,815)/.5750 = ($236,200). 2.11 “b” in the formula is the amount advanced under the notional loan, converted into NZ$ at the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 = $224,138. 2.12 “c” and “d” in the formula are zero. The result of the formula in Determination G9A in the year ended 30 June 1997 is therefore ($236,200) + $224,138 = ($12,062). Because this is a negative amount, it is expenditure to the purchaser. 2.13 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 = $224,138; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 1 March. This is US$130,000/.55 = $236,364. The result is therefore ($12,226). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be income to the purchaser. 2.14 The purchaser's income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($12,062) + $12,226 which gives income of $164. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2.15 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; b is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate A, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. US$130,000/.55 = $236,364; c is income already recognized, of $164. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,086. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.16 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $236,364 for the glass will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. Rate and Method B 2.17 If the purchaser applies section OB 7(1)(b) and calculates the NZ$ Lowest Price of the glass using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.18 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 2.4. However, in calculating this income or expenditure, it does not use Determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). 2.19 To calculate the foreign currency income/expenditure, the purchaser allocates the US$10,000 expenditure (ie. the difference between the Lowest Price and the price) over the period from 15 March to 15 September on a straight line basis. For the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (107/184) × US$10,000 = US$5,815. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2.20 The purchaser converts this amount into NZ$ using the spot rate at year end, which gives NZ$ expenditure of US$5.815/.575 = $10.113. 2.21 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 30 June to 15 September (the expected Settlement Date on 30 June). This is US$130,000/.577 = $225,303; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 1 February (the Contract Date) to 1 September (the expected Settlement Date on 1 February). This is US$130,000/.585 = $222,222. The result is $3,081. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be expenditure to the purchaser. 2.22 The purchaser's income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($10,113) + ($3,081) which gives expenditure of $13,194. 2.23 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, convened into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; b is the acquisition price, calculated convening the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate B, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date ie. US$130,000/.585 = $222,222; c is expenditure already recognised, of $13,194. The base price adjustment is therefore $10,198. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.24 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the glass of $222,222 will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Rate and Method C 2.25 If the purchaser applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the glass using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.26 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses determination G9A to determine its income or expenditure from the loan. The calculations are set out in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.12, which will give it expenditure of $12,062 from the notional loan. 2.27 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; b is the acquisition price, calculated convening the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate C, the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. US$130,000/.58 = $224,138; c is expenditure already recognized, of $12,062. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,414. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.28 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $224,138 for the glass will also be its cost price for tax purposes. Rate and Method D 2.29 If the purchaser applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the glass using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.30 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses determination G9A to determine its income or expenditure from the loan. The calculations are set out in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.12, which will give it expenditure of $12,062 from the notional loan. 2.31 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 which is $224,138; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Contract Date. This is US$130,000/.56 = $232,143. The result is ($8,005). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be income to the purchaser. 2.32 The purchaser's income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($12,062) + $8,005 which gives expenditure of $4,057. 2.33 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; b is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate D, the spot rate on the Contract Date, ie. US$130,000/.56 = $232,143; c is expenditure already recognized, of $4,057. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,414. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.34 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the glass of $232.143 will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. Example 3: Sale of trading stock: payment in arrears Calculation of income by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various rates and methods This is an example of a contract with payment in arrears and no charge for the deferral. It shows how Rates and Methods A to D would apply to calculate a seller's income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. Initially, it is on the basis that both delivery and payment are after balance date. Then the balance date is changed so that the delivery is before balance date. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3.1 On 15 October 1996 the taxpayer, a NZ wool exporter, agrees to sell 10,000kg of wool for US$3 per kilo, delivered to a Japanese port specified by the buyer. On both the Contract Date and 31 March, the exporter reasonably expects that delivery will occur on 20 April 1997. US$3 is the price the parties would agree for payment on the delivery date. Payment is required 60 days after delivery. The exporter has a 31 March balance date. 3.2 The wool is actually delivered on 25 May 1997, and payment is made on 29 July 1997. 3.3 The US$/NZ$ exchange rates in the 1997 income year are as follows: 3.4 Diagrammatically, the transaction can be represented as follows: General 3.5 Whichever method the exporter decides to use, it will have to treat itself as party to a notional foreign currency loan: (a) from the exporter to the buyer; (b) advanced on 25 May 1997 (the Rights Date); (c) of an amount equal to the Lowest Price of US$30,000: (d) repaid on 29 July 1997 (the payment date); (e) with a repayment amount of US$30,000. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Rate and Method A 3.6 If the exporter applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the wool using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.7 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 3.5 above. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at this date, there is no income or expenditure. 3.8 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for delivery of currency on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April 1997. This is US$30,000/.612 = $49,020; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April 1997. This is US$30,000/.605 = $49,587. The result is therefore ($567). Since this is a negative amount and the exporter is the seller, it will be expenditure to it. This will be the exporter's expenditure from the agreement for the year. 3.9 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the Forward Rate on 15 October 1996 (the Contract Date) for delivery on 20 April 1997 (the expected Rights Date). This is US$30,000/.605 which is NZ$49,587; c is income/expenditure already recognized, which in this case is (NZ$567). The base price adjustment is therefore ($2,145) which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. This amount is attributable to the fluctuation in the US$/NZ$ exchange rate G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] between the balance date and the payment date. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $49,587. 3.10 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the taxpayer had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June 1997 is NZ$1:US$0.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the taxpayer applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from delivery date to balance date, in the principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: This will be expenditure to the taxpayer. 3.11 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. 25 May. This is US$30,000/.635 = $47,244; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April. This is US$30,000/.605 = $49,587. The result is therefore ($2,343). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be expenditure to the seller. 3.12 The taxpayer's total expenditure from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $3,075. 3.13 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the amount received by the taxpayer. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the forward exchange rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. it is NZ$49,587; c is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($3,075). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the taxpayer. Rate and Method B 3.14 If the exporter applies section OB 7(1)(b) and calculates the NZ$ Lowest Price of the wool using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.15 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan described in paragraph 3.5. However, in calculating this income or expenditure, it does not use determination G9A . Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on Payment Date (or year end, if Payment Date is after year end). 3.16 As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure. 3.17 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 31 March for delivery of currency on the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.615 = $48,780; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.62 = $48,387. The result is therefore $393. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be income to it. This will be the exporter's income from the agreement for the year. 3.18 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where a is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the US$ into NZ$ using Rate B, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date. This is US$30,000/.62 which is NZ$48,387; c is income already recognized, which in this case is NZ$393. The base price adjustment is therefore ($1,905) which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $48,387. 3.19 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter does not use Determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). Since there is no US$ income from the notional loan, there will also be no NZ$ income using this method. 3.20 The second step required is for the exporter to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date (now 30 June) for delivery of currency on the expected Settlement Date. Although the expected Settlement Date on the Contract Date was 20 June, the wool has been delivered late, and the expected Settlement Date is now 29 July. Assume that the forward rate from 30 June to 29 July is .61. “a” is therefore US$30,000/.61 = $49,180; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date at that time, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.62 = $48,387. The result is therefore $793. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be income to it. The exporter's total income from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $793. 3.21 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a − (b + c) where a is the NZ$ value of the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the US$30,000 into NZ$ using Rate B, the forward exchange rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.62 = NZ$48,387. c is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is $793. The base price adjustment is therefore ($2,305), which is an allowable deduction to the taxpayer. Rate and Method C 3.22 If the exporter applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the wool using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.23 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997, the exporter first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan, set out in paragraph 3.5. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure in that year. 3.24 In the 1998 income year the exporter applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4 to the contract to sell the wool. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the buyer. This is the US$ price of the wool, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate C (the spot rate on the Rights Date), ie. US$30,000/.635 = $47,244; c = expenditure already recognized, of 0. The base price adjustment is therefore ($369). Since this is a negative amount and the exporter is the holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be an allowable deduction to the exporter in the 1998 year. 3.25 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the wool will also be its sale price for tax purposes. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3.26 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter applies determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from the Rights Date to balance date, in the NZ$ value of principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: This will be expenditure to the exporter in the 1997 year. 3.27 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the amount received by the exporter. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; b is the acquisition price calculated converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. it is NZ$47,244; c is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($732). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the taxpayer. Rate and Method D 3.28 If the exporter applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the wool using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.29 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 3.5. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure in that year. 3.30 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the result of: a − b G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price using the spot rate on balance date. This is US$30,000/.61 which is $49,180; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price using the spot rate on Contract Date. This is US$30,000/.585 which is $51,282. The result is therefore ($2,102). As this is negative and the exporter is the seller, this is expenditure to the exporter. This will be all of its expenditure in the 1997 year from the wool contract. This expenditure is solely attributable to the fluctuations in the US$/NZ$ spot exchange rate. 3.31 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; b is the acquisition price. Because the exporter is using Rate D, this is calculated by converting the US$ into NZ$ using the exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.585 which is NZ$51,282; c is income/expenditure already recognized, which in this case is (NZ$2,102). The base price adjustment is therefore $2,305 which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $51,282. 3.32 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from delivery date to balance date, in the principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: This will be expenditure to the exporter. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3.33 The exporter will also have to make the adjustment a − b. In this case: a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$30,000/.635 which is $47,244; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Contract Date. This is US$30,000/.585 which is $51,282. The result is therefore ($4,038). Since the exporter is the seller, and this amount is negative, it is expenditure. 3.34 The exporter's total expenditure from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $4,770. 3.35 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the amount received by the exporter. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; b is the acquisition price. Because the exporter is using Rate D, the US$30,000 is convened into NZ$ using the exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.585 which is NZ$51,282; c is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($4,770). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the exporter. Example 4: Further example of income calculation by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various rates and methods This is an example with payments in advance and in arrears, and no difference between the actual price and a cash settlement price. It shows how Rates and Methods A to D would apply to calculate a seller's income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 4.1 On 7 November 1997, a NZ furniture manufacturer with a December 31 balance date sells a consignment of pine furniture to an Australian purchaser for A$2,000,000. The furniture is to be shipped on a FOB basis, ie. the purchaser takes property in it once it is loaded on the vessel. A$150,000 is payable on 7 November, a further A$150,000 is payable once the furniture has been accepted by the shipper, and the remainder of the price is payable once the furniture is unloaded in Sydney, which is expected to be at the end of February. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.2 Because the furniture is shipped FOB, the Rights Date is the date it is loaded, which is expected to be 20 February 1998. The parties agree that A$2,000,000 is the price they would have agreed on for the furniture on the basis of payment in full on 20 February. 4.3 The goods are in fact shipped on 5 March 1998, and arrive in Sydney on 10 March 1998. The A$/NZ$ Spot Rates on the relevant dates, and the resulting NZ$ spot values, are: 4.4 Diagrammatically, the transaction can be represented as follows: General 4.5 Whichever method the manufacturer decides to use, it will have to treat itself as party to two notional foreign currency loans, as follows: 4.5.1 A loan from the buyer to the seller: (a) advanced on 7 November (the Contract Date); (b) of A$150,000; (c) repaid on 5 March 1998 (the Rights Date); (d) with a repayment amount of A$150,000. 4.5.2 A loan from the seller to the buyer: (a) advanced on 5 March (the Rights Date); (b) of A$1.7m; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 35 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (c) repaid on 10 March 1998 (the Settlement Date); (d) with a repayment amount of A$1.7m. Rate and Method A 4.6 If the manufacturer applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the furniture using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Rights Date it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.7 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 4.5.1 above. Applying the formula in Determination G9A, the furniture manufacturer's income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 will be calculated in accordance with the following formula: a + b − c − d where: a is the value of NZ$ of the closing tax book value, using the spot rate at balance date; and b is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given; and c the value in NZ$ of the opening tax book value, using the spot rate at the start of the year; and d is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given. 4.8 The closing tax book value is calculated as follows: e + f + g − h − i where e is the opening tax book value at the beginning of the year, if the person was a party to the arrangement at that time. This will be zero because the transaction was entered into during the year; and G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 36 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] f is the sum of the A$ value of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the seller in relation to the notional loan. This will be zero for the year, since the manufacturer does not repay the loan until the 1998 year; and g is the manufacturer's A$ income in respect of the loan during the year. This will be zero, since there is no difference between the A$ amounts lent and repaid; and h is the sum of the A$ value of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the manufacturer in relation to the notional loan. This will be A$150,000; and i is the A$ expenditure of the manufacturer in relation to the notional loan. This will be zero. The closing tax book value is therefore (A$150,000). 4.9 To calculate “a” in the formula, the manufacturer converts this closing tax book value into NZ$ using the spot rate on the balance date. This gives a figure of (A$150,000)/.911 = ($164,654). 4.10 “b” in the formula is the A$150,000 paid to the manufacturer during the income year, converted into NZ$ using the spot rate on the date of payment, ie. A$150,000/.8875, which is $169,014. 4.11 “c” and “d” in the formula are both zero. The manufacturer therefore has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. 4.12 The second step requires the manufacturer to calculate the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for exchange of currencies on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/ .9300 = $2,150,538; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date for exchange of currencies on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9205 = $2,172,732. The result is therefore ($22,194). Since this is a negative amount and the manufacturer is the seller, it will be expenditure to the seller. 4.13 The manufacturer's income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997 is therefore $4,360 + ($22,194) which gives expenditure of $17,834. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 37 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 4.14 In the year ended 31 December 1998, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be equal to: a − (b + c) where a is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer. This will be the total of (a) A$150,000/.8875 = $169,014 (the payment on the Contract Date); plus (b) A$150,000/.9505 = $157,812 (the payment on the shipment date); plus (c) A$1,700,000/.955 = $1,780,105 (the final payment) which gives a total of $2,106,931. b is the acquisition price, calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. it is $2,172,732 (A$2,000,000/.9205); c which is income/expenditure already recognized will be ($17,834). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($47,967). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.15 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2.172.732. Method B 4.16 If the manufacturer applies section OB 7(1)(b) and calculates the Lowest Price of the furniture using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.17 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan described in paragraph 4.5.1. However, in calculating this income or expenditure, it does not use Determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). Since there is no A$ income on the notional loan there is also no NZ$ income. 4.18 The second step required is for the manufacturer to calculate the amount: a − b G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 38 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for delivery of currency on the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9275 = $2,156,334; b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9250 = $2,162,162. The result is therefore ($5,828). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be expenditure to it. This will be the manufacturer's expenditure from the agreement for the year. 4.19 In the 1998 year, the manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a − (b + c) where a is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer, which will be A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate B, the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date, ie. it is A$2,000,000/.9250 = $2,162,162; c which is income/expenditure already recognized will be ($5,828). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($49,403). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.20 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,162,162. Rate and Method C 4.21 If the manufacturer applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the furniture using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.22 Under Method C, the manufacturer treats itself as being party to a notional A$ loan, as set out in paragraph 4.5.1. It applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997. It therefore undertakes the calculations set out in 4.7 G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 39 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to 4.11 above, and has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. 4.23 In the year ended 31 December 1998, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a − (b + c) where a is the total of the amounts received, ie. A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate C, ie. the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is A$2,000,000/.9505 = $2,104,156; c is income/expenditure already recognized which will be $4,360. The base price adjustment will therefore be ($1,585). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.24 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,104,156. Rate and Method D 4.25 If the manufacturer applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the furniture using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.26 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional A$ loan set out in paragraph 4.5.1. It applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997. It therefore undertakes the calculations set out in 4.7 to 4.11 above, and has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. 4.27 The furniture manufacturer must also take into account as income or expenditure the amount: a − b where a is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price calculated using the Spot Rate on the balance date. This is A$2,000,000/.9110 which is $2,195,390; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 40 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price calculated using the Spot Rate on the Contract Date. This is A$2,000,000/.8875 which is $2,253,521. The result is therefore ($58,131). Since the furniture manufacturer is the seller, this will be expenditure to the seller. 4.28 The furniture manufacturer's expenditure from the contract for the year ended 31 December 1997 will therefore be $4,360 + ($58,131) = ($53,771). 4.29 In the 1998 year, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a − (b + c) where a is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer, ie. A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; b is the acquisition price calculated by converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate D, the spot rate on the Contract Date of the Foreign Currency ASAP, will be $2,253,521; c which is income/expenditure already recognized will be ($53,771). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($92,819). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.30 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,253,521. Example 5: Purchase of a building: payment in arrears Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using rate and method E This is an example with payment in arrears, and a charge for the deferral. It shows how Rate and Method E would apply to calculate a buyer's income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 5.1 A commercial property is sold by a US resident to a NZ resident for US$1,400,000 on 1 February 1997. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the date possession passes, which is expected to occur in March, after the seller has undertaken certain repairs. They also agree that if payment were made on the date of possession, the price would have been US$1,300,000. G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 41 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.2 Possession of the property passes on 15 March 1997, which is the Rights Date. Therefore the term of the agreement is 1 February 1997 to 15 September 1997 — 226 days. 5.3 The purchaser's balance date is 30 June. 5.4 The US$/NZ$ spot exchange rates for the various dates are: 1 February 1997 0.5600 15 March 1997 0.5800 30 June 1997 0.5750 15 September 1997 0.5700 In this case the purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules. 5.5 This fact situation can be represented diagrammatically as follows: 5.6 The purchaser is entitled to use Rate and Method E, and elects to do so. For the year ended 30 June 1997, it calculates its income using the formula: a − b − c where a is the NZ$ value of the price. This is US$1,400,000/.57 = $2,456,140. Although the payment date is after the end of the relevant year, it is before the taxpayer is required to file its return for the year (for a 30 June year, 7 October — see section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994); b is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price, using the same exchange rate used to calculate “a”. This is US$1,300,000/.57 = $2,280,702; c is the unaccrued difference between the price and the Lowest Price, treating the agreement as a loan: (i) from the seller to the buyer; G29 27 September 1996 UNCLASSIFIED Page 42 of 43 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) advanced on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (iii) of US$1,300,000; (iv) repaid on 15 September 1997; (v) with a repayment amount of US$1,400,000. 5.7 To calculate this unaccrued difference, the purchaser allocates the resulting US$100,000 of expenditure over the period using an available method under the qualified accruals rules. For a loan of less than one year's duration, a straight line basis is available, and the purchaser elects to use this. 5.8 For the period after the end of the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (77/184) × US$100,000 = US$41,848. 5.9 The purchaser converts this amount into NZ$ using the same spot rate used to calculate “a”. This gives an unaccrued difference of: US$41,848/.57 = $73,417. 5.10 The result of a − b − c is therefore $2,456,140 − $2,280,702 − $73,417 = $102,021. Because this is a positive amount, it will be expenditure for the purchaser. 5.11 For the year ended 30 June 1998, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the building, converted into NZ$ at the spot rate when paid. This will be US$1,400,000/.57 = $2,456,140; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using the spot rate on the Payment Date. This is US$1,300,000/.57 = $2,280,702; c = expenditure already recognized, of $102,021. The base price adjustment is therefore $73,417, which will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 5.12 If the seller did not complete the repairs until July so that the purchaser did not take possession until after June, the buyer would have no expenditure under section EH 1 in the year ended 30 June 1997, since no payment under the notional loan contract would have been made during the 1997 year. 5.13 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $2,280,702 for the building will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Yield to Maturity Method Issued: 13 May 1987 G3 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method”. G3 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This Determination states how the yield to maturity method shall be applied to a financial arrangement to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred for the purposes of section 64C of the Income Tax Act 1976. It applies to all financial arrangements where the amounts and dates are known not later than the first balance date of the issuer or holder after issue or acquisition, as the case may be, and determined in New Zealand currency. The approach adopted is to define a constant annual rate R representing the yield to maturity of all the cash flows in the financial arrangement. Income derived and expenditure incurred is assumed to be compounded on the date of each payment. If they wish holders or issuers may simplify the calculations by using regular periods, such as half-years or weeks, where most or all of the cash flows occur at such intervals. However where a period between payments is longer than one year, income derived and expenditure incurred must be compounded at yearly intervals. In general there is no explicit formula for a yield to maturity in terms of the cashflows. The yield to maturity is defined as the discount rate at which the cashflows accumulate to zero. As part of the method, the amount of income derived or expenditure incurred to be compounded at the end of of each period is calculated as a fraction F multiplied by the principal outstanding during the period. This income derived and expenditure incurred is then added to the principal outstanding for the next period (if one exists). The final payment must equal the principal outstanding during the final period plus the income derived or expenditure incurred during that period. The amount of income derived or expenditure incurred by the holder or issuer in respect of a period is to be apportioned among income years in the period on a daily basis using Determination G1: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. In most normal commercial financial arrangements, the annual rate will be unique, positive and less than 100 percent per annum; arrangements that do not meet these criteria are excluded and may be submitted for individual consideration by the Commissioner. G3 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2 Reference This Determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976. It defines the application of the yield to maturity method to financial arrangements of the class described in paragraph 3 of this Determination. 3 Scope This Determination applies to the class of financial arrangements that has the following attributes— a) All amounts payable or receivable under the financial arrangement, and the dates on which the amounts are payable or receivable, are known not later than the first balance date of the issuer or holder following the date of issue or acquisition as the case may be; and b) All such amounts are determined in New Zealand currency— but does not apply to any financial arrangement in respect of which the annual yield to maturity rate R determined in accordance with paragraph 6 would be— c) Not unique; or d) Less than or equal to zero; or e) Greater than 100 percent. 4 Principle The yield to maturity method apportions the total income or expenditure under a financial arrangement so that— (a) The amount apportioned in respect of each period between payments represents a constant annual rate R on the amount of the principal outstanding during each period; and (b) The rate R is such that at the time the financial arrangement is issued or acquired the discounted value of the money to be given and received accumulates to zero. The amount apportioned to each period is then allocated to income years on a daily basis in accordance with Determination G1: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. G3 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5 Interpretation (1) In this Determination— (a) Unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meanings as in section 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976: (b) “The amount of the principal outstanding” during any period shall be equal to— (i) The amount of the principal outstanding during the previous period (if any); plus (ii) The amount (if any) payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer (as the case may be) immediately before the beginning of the period; plus (iii) The amount calculated in respect of the previous period in terms of paragraph 6(a) of this determination; less (iv) The amount (if any) receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer (as the case may be) immediately before the beginning of the period: (c) “Period” and “period between payments” means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable: Provided that if a period exceeds one year it shall be deemed to comprise one or more periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the holder or issuer as the case may be) by a period of less than one year. (2) For the purposes of applying paragraph 6(a) of this Determination— (a) Where the greatest common divisor of all the periods between payments is— (i) A year or 12 months, N shall be taken as 1: (ii) A halfyear or 6 months, N shall be taken as 2: (iii) A quarter or 3 months, N shall be taken as 4: (iv) A month, N shall be taken as 12: (v) A fornight, N shall be taken as 26: (vi) A week, N shall be taken as 52. (b) Where 1 or 2 periods have a greatest common divisor different to the greatest common divisor of all other periods this fact shall be disregarded, and for each of those 1 or 2 periods N shall be taken as 365 divided by the number of days in the G3 13 May 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] period including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period. 6 Method If R is a constant annual rate and if— (a) In respect of each period between payments an amount is obtained by multiplying the amount of the principal outstanding during that period by a fraction F where— N is— (i) The amount defined in paragraph 5(2) of this Determination; or (ii) Where paragraph 5(2)(a) of this Determination does not apply, 365 divided by the number of days in the period (including the ending date of the period but excluding the starting date of the period)— which amount forms part of the principal outstanding during the next succeeding period; and (b) The total of the principal outstanding during the final period between payments and the amount obtained in respect of that period pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph equals the amount of the final payment,— the amount obtained pursuant to subparagraph (a) shall be the amount of income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of that period by the holder or issuer (as the case may be). 7 Example On 12 March 1987 a holder acquires for $1,012,500 the right to receive the following income— The holder balances on 31 March, and chooses to allocate income on a 365 day basis.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Unit Trusts with Repurchase Obligations Issued: 30 July 1987 G4 This Determination may be cited as “Determination G4: Unit Trusts with Repurchase Obligations”. G4 30 July 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) This Determination deals with publicly-available unit trusts where the trust manager has agreed to purchase interests in the unit trust from unit holders at a price that reflects the value of the net assets of the trustees of the unit trust. It states that the gain or loss arising on the sale or disposal of an interest in such a unit trust is attributable solely to the interest in the unit trust. The interest of a unit holder in a unit trust is deemed to be a share under section 211 of the Income Tax Act 1976. A share is an “excepted financial arrangement” for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act. The effect of this is that the gain or loss is attributable to an excepted financial arrangement and is not dealt with under sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2 Reference This Determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope This Determination shall apply to every publicly-available unit trust in relation to which there is a market-value buy-back obligation on the trust manager. 4 Principle The intention of the regime, enacted as sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976, for the income tax treatment of financial arrangements, is to deal only with income, gains or losses, and expenditure in relation to debt and surrogates for debt. It is not intended to affect the income tax treatment of equity where equity is not used to construct a surrogate for debt. A publicly-available unit trust is a vehicle for public participation in a business venture. An interest in such a unit trust is equity. This is recognised by section 211 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which provides that for the purposes of the Income Tax Act— (a) Every unit trust shall be deemed to be a company; and G4 30 July 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (b) the interests of the unit holders in a unit trust shall be deemed to be shares in the company; and (c) he unit holders shall be deemed to be shareholders in the company. An obligation to purchase amounts to an option to sell for the person that may have the obligation enforced. An option to sell at market-value has no value. The market-value buy-back obligation on a trust manager amounts to an undertaking on the part of the trust manager to make a market in interests of the trust or to arrange an orderly realisation of trust assets to ensure that unit holders may realise their investments. 5 Definitions In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires— (a) Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Income Tax Act 1976, and where an expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M or 211 of that Act, the expression shall have that meaning in this Determination: (b) “Market-value buy-back obligation on the trust manager”, in relation to a unit trust, means an undertaking by or an obligation upon the trust manager that— (i) Is recorded in the trust deed or in a prospectus issued to promote the sale of interests in the unit trust; and (ii) Binds the trust manager to purchase, at a price that reflects the market- value of the net assets of the trustees, interests in the unit trust offered to the trust manager for purchase: (c) “Publicly-available unit trust” means a unit trust the interests in which may be freely traded without seeking the approval of any person, other than a person charged by statute with the regulation of offers of securities generally to the public or the regulation of trading in securities generally: (d) “Security” has the meaning given in section 2 of the Securities Act 1978: (e) “Trust manager”, in relation to a unit trust, means a person— (i) charged with the management of the affairs of the unit trust, or some part of those affairs; and (ii) Recognised in the trust deed as having that responsibility: (f) “Trust deed”, in relation to a unit trust, means the deed creating the trusts upon which the trustees hold the assets of the unit trust: G4 30 July 1987 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6 Method Where— (a) A person holds an interest in a publicly-available unit trust in relation to which there is a market-value buy-back obligation on the trust manager; and (b) There is no other arrangement that includes the interest and the market-value buy-back obligation on the trust manager,— in calculating the assessable income of the person in any income year— (c) Any gain or loss on the sale or disposal of the interest is attributable to the interest; and (d) The acquisition price of the interest is attributable to the interest; and (e) The consideration receivable by the person in relation to the interest, including— (i) any consideration that is a dividend; and (ii) any consideration that is received or receivable on the sale or disposal of the interest,— is attributable to the interest. 7 Example Each Unit Trust Deed that has a repurchase option will, by virtue of section 16(2) of the Unit Trusts Act 1960, also contain a mechanism for calculating a minimum repurchase price. For the purposes of this Determination it will suffice to use the mechanism specified in the respective Trust Deeds. Such a mechanism should allow the trust manager to arrive at a figure for Net Asset Value (less any administrative costs) which would be divided by the number of units so as to arrive at a repurchase price per unit. Examples of suitable mechanisms are contained in the Trust Deeds for the New Zealand Rural Property Trust dated the 30th day of January 1987 and the Qtron Share Portfolio Trust dated the 26th day of July 1985.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes Issued: 18 February 1994 G5C This Determination may be cited as “Determination G5C: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes”. G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination replaces Determination G5B: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes for notes entered into on, or after, the date of publication of this determination in the New Zealand Gazette. 2. A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note is a financial arrangement in which the holder of the Note provides money to a company, and the debt is discharged at a future date by the issue of shares (or stock) in any company. Interest may be payable for the period between the issue of the Note and conversion into shares. Such payments are called Coupon Interest Payments. 3. As a share is an excepted financial arrangement under section 64B of the Act, only the Coupon Interest Payments and amount attributed to those payments by this determination are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculating accrual income or expenditure. 4. Determination G5C prescribes the method to be used when calculating for accrual purposes the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note. It also details which amounts are to be included for this calculation, and which are attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. 5. Determination G5C differs from Determination G5B by: a) broadening the scope of the determination so that it applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note converting into shares in a company other than the company that issued the Note; and b) narrowing the scope of the determination so that it only applies to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note where the interest rate is not less than 5% p.a. (or half of the interest rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrowings if lower) nor more than 15% p.a. (or double of the interest rate the issuer would have paid on cash repayment borrowings if higher). 2 Reference This Determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) and (e), and section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 3 Scope Except where its application is specifically excluded in another determination, Determination G5C applies to every Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note which: 1. Is entered into on, or after, the date of publication in the New Zealand Gazette (however, it does not apply to notes which are issued pursuant to a binding contract entered into before the date of publication); and 2. Meets the following criteria: (a) conversion into shares of a company is at a predetermined ratio; and (b) Coupon Interest Payments are payable at regular intervals of not more than 12 months; and (c) Coupon Interest Payments are of equal amount, or are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator (if this condition is not satisfied because of the issue date or conversion date of the Note, but the rate at which the payment is calculated is consistent with the other Coupon Interest Payments required under the Note, this determination shall apply as if the condition were met); and (d) the constant annual rate R calculated using Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, applied to the Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note is: (i) not less than the lesser of: (A) 5% p.a.; or (B) half the annual coupon which the company issuing the Note would have had to pay on similarly secured borrowings of similar amount as at the date of issue; and (ii) not more than the greater of: (A) 15% p.a.; or (B) twice the coupon which the company issuing the Note would have had to pay on similarly secured borrowings of similar amount as at the date of issue; and taking into account the amount or amounts payable by the holder consequent upon issue and assuming that— (iii) Coupon Interest Payments will be paid to the holder in accordance with the terms of the Note provided that if the Coupon Interest Payments are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator, the value of that indicator as at the issue date shall be assumed to apply for the term of the Note; and (iv) the only payment (other than a coupon payment) made to the holder on the conversion of the Note is a cash payment equal to the issue price of the Note; and G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (e) the Note is not part of another financial arrangement. 4 Principle 1. A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has both debt and equity components. It can be regarded alternatively as: (a) a loan to a company with repayment in shares (debt component); or (b) a forward purchase of shares (in which case the holder of the Note is buying a share of a business and has equity in it). The accruals regime is not intended to deal with equity, and therefore classifies a share (equity in a business) as an excepted financial arrangement (see section 64B). 2. As a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has this dual character, when calculating income/expenditure in relation to the Note it is first necessary to separate the debt and equity components of the Note. 3. This determination specifies that, apart from the Coupon Interest Payments and amounts attributed to those payments by this determination, all amounts relate to the underlying shares (equity component), and will not be dealt with under the accruals regime (sections 64B to 64M) when calculating assessable income. 4. Income and expenditure in respect of the Note is calculated by pro-rata daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years. 5. For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the shares between the issue date of the Note and the conversion into shares is due to the equity component. Therefore the difference in share price can be ignored when calculating income and expenditure. 6. This approach may not be appropriate where the coupon interest rate is so much above or below market rates at the time of issue that it may represent an adjustment between the acquisition price of the Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note and the expected value, as at the time of issue, of the underlying shares at the time of conversion. This determination has therefore been limited as set out in paragraph (d) of subclause 3(2). 5 Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires— G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1. Expressions used, except the expression “Income Year”, have the same meaning as in section 2 and section 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976. (a) the “Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976. (b) “Coupon Interest Payment” means any amount payable on the Note by the Note issuer (borrower) to the Note holder (lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conversion of the Note. (c) “Income Year” (i) when a taxpayer furnishes a return of income under section 15 of the Act for an accounting year ending with a balance date other than the 31st day of March, “Income Year” means the period of twelve months ending on that balance date. (ii) for any other person, “Income Year” means the year ending on the 31st day of March in which the income has been derived or expenditure has been incurred by that person. (d) “Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note”, or “Note” means any debenture, bond, certificate, document, note or writing issued or given by a company: (i) which provides evidence that the company is indebted to the holder of the Note, whether for a loan to the company, money subscribed to the company or any other liability of the company (whether or not the amount for which the company has issued the Note is secured over the undertaking or any of the assets of the company); and (ii) which provides for the debt to be discharged only by the issue of shares in the capital of any company. This may be pursuant to a trust deed. (e) “Underlying Shares” in relation to a Note means the shares or stock into which the Note is convertible, or in which it may be redeemed or paid. 2. A determination to which Determination G5C refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. 3. For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a meaning different from that given by its definition. G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6 Method 1. Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure with regard to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note: (a) in respect of income, gain or loss, or expenditure, and also of any other consideration receivable by the holder or payable by the issuer, the amounts taken into account to calculate income/expenditure consist of: (i) Coupon Interest Payments; (ii) amounts attributed to Coupon Interest Payments as set out in subclause 6(3). (b) in respect of the acquisition price, the amounts to be included when calculating income/expenditure are those attributed to Coupon Interest Payments as set out in subclause 6(4). 2. The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payments to Income Years. For the method, see Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. 3. If a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note on which interest is payable is sold part way through an interest period, then it is necessary to apportion the Coupon Interest Payment between the seller and the purchaser. The seller is allocated interest, on a daily straight line basis, that accrues before the date of sale. (See Example C). Note: If the Coupon Interest Payment is not known until after the date of sale, it shall be assumed to be equal to the Coupon Interest Payment for the previous period (adjusted for any difference in the length of the period). 4. The portion of the sale price thus attributed to accrued interest and allocated to the seller is, in turn, treated as the purchaser's acquisition price of the financial arrangement. If the purchaser later receives the Coupon Interest Payment for the sale period, then this portion attributed to accrued interest may be immediately offset against the amount received when calculating the amount of income derived from the financial arrangement in that year. (See Example C). G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7 Example Example A On 13 September 1987 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 12% p.a. payable half-yearly in arrears. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13 September 1988 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The Coupon Interest Payments are made as follows: (a) Year Ended 31 March 1988 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/9/88. There are 18 days between 13 March and 31 March 1988, and 184 days between 13 March and 13 September 1988 (b) Year Ended 31 March 1989 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a − (b + c) is applied: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($12.00) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($6.59). As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and sharemarket value can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes). Therefore, in this example “b” has a value of zero. Example B On 13 November 1992 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 10% p.a. payable half-yearly in arrears. The first period is only for 5 months. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13 October 1994 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The Coupon Interest Payments are made as follows: (a) Year Ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 138 are in the Income Year ended 31 March 1993. (b) Year Ended 31 March 1994 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 13 are in the year ended 31 March 1994. Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94. G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There are a total of 182 days in the period between payments. Of these, 169 are in the year ended 31 March 1994. (c) Year Ended 31 March 1995 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a − (b + c) is applied: a = sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($13.79). As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and share market values can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for the accrual purposes), hence in this example “b” has a value of zero. Example C The original holder of the Note described in Example B sells the Note on 20 December 1992, for $120, to a new holder who holds the Note to maturity. The sale of the Note takes place part way through an interest period, so it is necessary to apportion the Coupon Interest Payment between the seller and the purchaser. The Coupon Interest Payment for this period amounts to $4.15. Using a straight-line apportionment, $1.01 of the $4.15 is attributable to that portion of the period ending 20 December 1992 during which the Note is owned by the original holder ($4.15 × 37/151. There are 151 days in the coupon period, and there are 37 days from the beginning of the period until the day that the Note is sold.) This amount of $1.01 is income to the original holder and acquisition price to the new holder. The original holder would be considered to have sold the equity portion of the convertible Note for $118.99. (a) Income for the Original Holder: Year Ended 31 March 1993 G5C 18 February 1994 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 10 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Since this is the final year of the arrangement from the point of view of the original holder, the base price adjustment is applied, using the following values: a = sum of all amounts paid ($1.01) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($0). (b) Income for the New Holder: Year Ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/4/93. There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 138 are in the year ended 31 March 1993. (c) Year Ended 31 March 1994 As for Example B. (d) Year Ended 31 March 1995 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjustment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a − (b + c) is applied: a = sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price ($1.01) c = income/expenditure in previous years ($12.78).

G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6 Method 1. APPROVED MARKETS The New Zealand foreign currency market and the Australian foreign currency market in European Currency Units and in the currencies of the following countries and territories are approved: 2. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The following sources of information for foreign currency rates are approved: a) In relation to spot contracts, a multicontributor page that quotes rates for spot contracts; b) In relation to forward contracts, a multicontributor page or a contributor page that quotes rates for forward contracts; and c) Where a person does not have access to a multicontributor page or a contributor page or where the rates for a forward contract are not available from a multicontributor page, advice as to the buy and sell rates for a forward contract or spot contract given to that person by an approved foreign exchange dealer, which rates shall be derived from an approved source and shall be the rates at which the approved foreign exchange dealer would perform the foreign exchange transaction. 3. SPOT CONTRACTS a) Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to determine the rate for a G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] spot contract at the end of an income year, the rate for the spot contract shall be the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for that spot contract. b) Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to ascertain in New Zealand currency the value of a cashflow paid or received in a foreign currency, the rate of exchange to be applied shall be,— (i) Where the cashflow is not converted to New Zealand currency on the day it is paid or received, the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for a spot contract for that currency at any time on that day; or (ii) Where the cashflow is converted to New Zealand currency on the day it is paid or received, the rate of exchange obtained in relation to the cashflow. c) Where a buy and sell rate for a spot contract is not quoted on a multicontributor page, the rate for the spot contract shall be the cross rate calculated by reference to— (i) The rate quoted on a multicontributor page for the foreign currency against the United States Dollar; and (ii) The rate quoted on a multicontributor page for the United States Dollar against the New Zealand Dollar. 4. FORWARD CONTRACTS Where, for the purposes of determining the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement, it is necessary to determine the rate for a forward contract at the end of the income year and,— a) Where the buy and sell points for the forward contract are quoted on a multicontributor page, the rate for the forward contract shall be the midpoint between the buy and sell rates for that forward contract obtained by reference to the multicontributor page; b) Where the buy and sell points for the forward contract are not quoted on a multicontributor page, but the buy and sell points for similar forward contracts of shorter term (“the shorter contract”) and of longer term (“the longer contract”) are quoted on a multicontributor page, the rate shall be the rate obtained by reference to the multicontributor page using straight line interpolation of the midpoints between the buy and sell rates for the shorter contract and the longer contract which have terms closest to the term of the forward contract; G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] c) Where the rate cannot be obtained by reference to points on a multicontributor page and where the rate for that forward contract is available by reference to contributor pages, then the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the midpoints of not less than 3 buy and sell rates for the forward contract obtained from contributor pages; and d) Where the rate cannot be obtained by reference to paragraphs 6(4)(a) to (c) of this determination, the rate shall be the arithmetic mean of not less than three rates being any of— (i) The midpoints of the buy and sell rates quoted for the forward contract by one or more approved foreign exchange dealers; or (ii) Where the points for similar forward contracts of shorter term (“the shorter contract”) and of longer term (“the longer contract”) are quoted on a contributor page, then the rate shall be the rate obtained by reference to the contributor page using straight line interpolation of the midpoints between the buy and sell rates for the shorter contract and the longer contract which have terms closest to the forward contract. 5. A person applying paragraphs 6(3)(a) or 6(4) of this determination may obtain the rate for a spot contract or forward contract using the method prescribed in those paragraphs at any time on the last day of the income year: Provided that— a) The rate applied is the rate obtained at the cut-off time in relation to the person and the income year; and b) The method for determining the cut-off time adopted by that person is consistently applied in respect of each income year: Provided also that where there is no market at the cut-off time, the rate shall be— c) The rate obtained at the later of— (i) The end of trading in forward contracts or spot contracts by that person in the income year; and (ii) 3.00 pm New Zealand Standard Time on the last day in the income year on which there was a market; or d) The rate for the earlier of— (i) The commencement of trading in forward contracts or spot contracts by that person in the following income year; and G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (ii) 7.30 am New Zealand Standard Time on the first day in the following income year on which there was a market. 7 Example This is an example of the application of the averaging process and straight line interpolation required for certain forward foreign exchange contracts under the determination. On its balance date of 30 June 1991 a New Zealand corporate had a forward foreign exchange contract for delivery of 1.2 million New Zealand Dollars for 612,000 United States Dollars on 1 August 1992. The contract therefore is to be fulfilled in approximately 13 months time. At the balance date the foreign exchange quotations for the New Zealand Dollar against the United States Dollar were (from the multicontributor page ASAP on the Reuters system): Also at that date the quotations of forward foreign exchange points for the United States Dollar against the New Zealand Dollar by three market participants were (as provided on their Reuters screens): Forward Points Note that to obtain the forward rates the forward points need to be subtracted from the spot rate. The mid-rates for use in the interpolation formula are therefore: G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The arithmetic mean of the midpoints of the forward rates is calculated to be: A suitable formula for straight line interpolation to obtain the required rate is: P1 is the mid-rate for the forward contract with the shorter term (= 0.55366). P2 is the mid-rate for the forward contract with the longer term (= 0.50975). Px is the required rate. T1 is the term till delivery (expressed in days) of the forward contract with the shorter term (= 365). T2 is the term till delivery (expressed in days) of the forward contract with the longer term (= 730). Tx is the term till delivery of the contract held (= 398). The required rate is therefore calculated as follows: G6D 24 October 1991 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 9 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The current value of the 612,000 United States Dollars receivable on 1 August 1992 is therefore 1,113,354.80 New Zealand Dollars.

G7C 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, both of which were made by the Commissioner on 4 December 1989. This determination differs from Determinations G7B and G18 by amalgamating the two, updating the terminology used in relation to the New Zealand Futures & Options Exchange and members thereof, adding to the list of approved markets on that exchange and to the list of approved overseas futures and options markets, modifying the approved sources of information in respect of those overseas markets and substituting more relevant and up-to-date examples. 2. This determination applies where, for the purpose of calculating the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a Futures Contract or Option Contract, it is necessary to determine the price of that contract. 3. This determination sets out the approved markets, sources of information, and method, used for determining the prices for Futures Contracts and Option Contracts that are either traded on the New Zealand Futures Exchange or denominated in a foreign currency. It does not apply in relation to Option Contracts in respect of shares, as such contracts are “excepted financial arrangements” (as defined in subsection 64B(1) of the Act) and are not subject to the accrual provisions. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to Subsections 64E(1) and (6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, both of which were made on 4 December 1989. 3 Scope of Determination This determination applies where, for the purpose of calculating the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a Futures Contract or Option Contract, it is necessary to determine the price of that contract. It does not apply in relation to Option Contracts in respect of shares, as such contracts are “excepted financial arrangements” (as defined in subsection G7C 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 64B(1) of the Act) and are not subject to the accrual provisions. It does, however, apply to options relating to share price indices (such as the NZSE-40 Capital Share Price Index Option Contract). 4 Principle 1. Markets are approved having regard to the following criteria— a) The number of participants in the market or having access to the market; b) Frequency of trading in the market; c) The nature of trading in the market — how the price or rate is determined and how the financial assets are traded on the market; d) The existence, in relation to the market, of an appropriate regulatory body established by law; e) The potential or demonstrated capacity of a person or group of persons to significantly influence the market; f) Significant barriers to entry; and g) Discrimination on the basis of quantity bought and sold unless based on the risks involved or the transaction costs or economies of scale. 2. Sources of information are approved having regard to the following criteria— a) Reliance on the sources of information by the market; and b) The accessibility of the sources of information by participants in the market. 3.

The Statement of Open Position referred to in paragraph 6(4)(a) of this determination will generally set out information relevant to the particular Futures Contract or Option Contract, including delivery month, number bought or number sold. The following are illustrative examples of advice as to the market price of Futures Contracts and Option Contracts which may be obtained from the New Zealand futures and options market’s G7C 22 January 1993 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] clearing house by New Zealand Dealers who subscribe to an optional “brokers package” system: In this example, Merchant Bank has positions in the September 92 and December 92 BBC contracts, which it has acquired at different times. The market price for September 92 contracts at 1/5/92 was 93.13, and for December was 92.98. The margin column states the unrealised profit in terms of margin deposited, and variable margin accumulated and eroded. Therefore the transaction of 20 bought BBC futures contracts on 12/12/91 has an unrealised profit of $54,062.80. Merchant Bank has an unrealised profit of $49,774.60 for the September 92 maturity, and $51,666.80 for the December 92 maturity, giving a total of $101,441.40.

The net unrealised profit position of Merchant Bank is indicated in the margin column. The premium value indicates the maximum profit that could be received by the option writer (seller) at the expiration of the option contracts (the declaration date). If, on the expiration date, there is a debt margin (ie, loss), that amount will be deducted from the premium value before any profit is realised. 2.

UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > GENERAL Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars Issued: 4 December 1989 G9A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a currency or commodity other than New Zealand Dollars”. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G9: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars made on the 28th July 1988. This determination differs from Determination G9: Financial Arrangements Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars in that agreements for sale and purchase of property are included in the scope of this determination. 2. This determination sets out a method for calculating the income or expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement where any rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a “base currency” other than New Zealand dollars; this base currency might be a foreign currency or a commodity. 3. The method used is essentially the base price method set out in Chapter 9 of the Consultative Document on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure. Income or expenditure is calculated for each income year in accordance with the Act and other determinations where appropriate (for example G3), in the base currency. 4. This income or expenditure, together with the opening tax book value and adjusted for amounts paid or received during the income year, is used to calculate the closing tax book value of the financial arrangement as at year end. In the case of a conventional loan, this closing tax book value is equivalent to the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the loan as at year end, in the base currency. This closing tax book value is converted to New Zealand dollars at the spot rate applicable at that date. 5. The income or expenditure in New Zealand dollars is determined from: a) The amounts paid and/or received during the income year, converted to New Zealand dollars on the dates of payment; together with b) The net change in the amount of closing tax book values in New Zealand dollars during the income year. This brings to account for income tax purposes all accrued gains and losses on the financial arrangement, including gains and losses arising from currency translation. 6. This determination requires that where a financial arrangement involves or is expressed in more than one currency or commodity, each separate currency or commodity tranche is to be treated as a separate financial arrangement. 7. Where— G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] a) A facility provides for the rollover of a financial arrangement; and b) No payment under any arrangement arising from the rollover is material to or contingent upon the financial arrangement— the financial arrangement matures when the rollover occurs. However, where a payment under an arrangement arising from the rollover is material to or contingent upon the financial arrangement, any arrangement that includes the payment is a part of the financial arrangement. 2 Reference 1. This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 2. Determination G9: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this Determination G9A is signed. 3 Scope of Determination 1. This determination shall apply where it is necessary to calculate the income or expenditure of a person in respect of a financial arrangement and any right or obligation of the person in relation to the financial arrangement is fixed or otherwise determined in a currency or commodity other than New Zealand dollars (NZD) and is not fixed in NZD. 2. This determination shall not apply to— a) A forward or future contract: b) A futures contract: c) A swap contract: d) An option: e) A security arrangement. 4 Principle 1. Income or expenditure shall be calculated in the base currency or commodity in accordance with the Act and determinations, as if the base currency or commodity were NZD. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 2. Amounts paid or received during an income year shall be converted to NZD at spot rates at the time of the payment or receipt. 3. At the end of each income year the closing tax book value is calculated in the base currency equal to— a) The closing tax book value (if any) in relation to the previous income year; Plus b) Amounts paid by the holder or received by the issuer (as the case may be) during the income year and in relation to the financial arrangement; Plus c) Income or expenditure calculated as in clause 4(1) of this determination; Less d) Amounts received by the holder or paid by the issuer (as the case may be) during the income year in relation to the financial arrangement. 4. The closing tax book value is converted to NZD at the then spot rate and the net change from the previous income year is brought into income or expenditure for the income year. 5. The total income or expenditure is the sum of the amounts calculated in clauses 4(2) and 4(4) of this Determination. 6. For the purpose of determining the income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred in respect of a financial arrangement that involves separate amounts expressed in more than one currency or commodity and in respect of an income year, the financial arrangement shall be treated as separate financial arrangements in relation to each separate amount. 5 Interpretation In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires,— Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act, except that where there is a conflict between the meaning of an expression in sections 64B to 64M of the Act and the meaning of the expression elsewhere in the Act the expression shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: "The Act" means the Income Tax Act 1976: G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] "Base currency" in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency or commodity in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed: "Base currency expenditure" in relation to a person and a financial arrangement and an income year, means the amount of the expenditure of the person in respect of the financial arrangement and the income year, calculated in the base currency in relation to the financial arrangement but otherwise in accordance with the Act and determinations made under it (subject to clause 6(4) of this Determination regarding the application of Determination G2 : Requirements as to Precision): "Base currency income" in relation to a person and a financial arrangement and an income year, means the amount of the income of the person in respect of the financial arrangement and the income year, calculated in the base currency in relation to the financial arrangement but otherwise in accordance with the Act and determinations made under it (subject to clause 6(4) of this Determination regarding the application of Determination G2 : Requirements as to Precision): "Closing tax book value", in relation to an income year means the value of a person's rights and obligations under a financial arrangement, calculated in accordance with the following formula: e + f + g − h − i where— e is— (i) Where the person was a party to the financial arrangement at the beginning of the income year, the opening tax book value of the person's rights and obligations under the financial arrangement; and (ii) In every other case, nil; and f is the sum of the value (expressed in the base currency in relation to the financial arrangement) of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the person in relation to the financial arrangement; and g is the base currency income of the person in respect of the financial arrangement; and h is the sum of the value (expressed in the base currency in relation to the financial arrangement) of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the person in relation to the financial arrangement; and i is the base currency expenditure of the person in relation to the financial arrangement: G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] "Currency" includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement: "Exchange rate" means the price of one currency expressed in another currency: "Financial arrangement" has the same meaning as in sections 64B to 64M of the Act: Provided that, where a financial arrangement creates obligations in two or more currencies and the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each of the currencies is separately identifiable, the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each currency shall be treated as relating to separate financial arrangements: "NZD" means the currency of New Zealand: "Opening tax book value" , in relation to an income year and the rights and obligations of a person under a financial arrangement, means the closing tax book value of the person's rights and obligations under the financial arrangement at the end of the last preceding income year: "Spot rate" means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates. 6 Method 1.

DISCOUNTED BOND A NZ investor has a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 1989. The bond has a term of five years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10 million. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 1993. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For the purposes of this example USD refers to the currency of the United States of America and NZD refers to the currency of New Zealand. Suppose the spot rates on important dates in this example are: The accrued income in USD associated with the bond is given in the following table — this is calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method and allocated to income years according to Determination G1. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] ALL ITEMS IN USD At first balance date — 30 June 1989 The Closing Tax Book Value (CTBV) is given by: e + f + g − h − i e is 0 since the investor was not a party to this financial arrangement at the beginning of this income year. f is USD 8.3m the price paid for the bond on 1 September 1988, being the sum of all consideration given by the investor during the income year. g is USD 1,034,154 the base currency income accruing to the person in this income year calculated in accordance with the provisions of sections 64B to 64M of the Act. h is USD 500,000 (the interest payment of 1 March 1989) the sum of all consideration given to the person in the income year. i is 0 as there is no expenditure incurred by the investor. The formula gives a CTBV of: 0 + 8,300,000 + 1,034,154 − 500,000 − 0 = USD 8,834,154. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The income or expenditure in respect of the bond for the income year is calculated according to a + b − c − d. Where: a is the NZD value of the CTBV = 8,834,154 / .658 = $13,425,766. b is the NZD value of all consideration given to the person during the income year = 500,000 / .6455 = $774,593. c is the opening tax book value and has a nil value. d is the NZD value of all consideration given by the person during the income year = 8,300,000 / .6310 = $13,153,724. The income or expenditure is thus $1,046,635 NZD. This positive amount is income derived by the investor. At the second balance date — 30 June 1990. The CTBV is: e is 8,834,154 the opening tax book value equal to the CTBV of the previous year. f is 0 since no consideration is given by the investor in this income year. g is USD 1,281,465 the base currency income accruing to the person in this income year calculated in accordance with the provisions of sections 64B to 64M of the Act. h is USD 1,000,000 (the interest payments of 1 September 1989 and 1 March 1990) the sum of all consideration given to the person in the income year. i is 0 as there is no expenditure incurred by the investor. The CTBV (e + f + g − h − i) is then equal to USD 9,115,619. The income or expenditure associated with the bond on this date is calculated according to a + b − c − d. Where: a is 9,115,619 / .6500 = $14,024,029 b is 500,000 / .6500 + 500,000 / .6550 = $1,532,590. c is USD 8,834,154 / .6580 = NZD 13,425,766 G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] d is nil. This equates to $2,130,853 NZD. As this is a positive amount it is income derived by the investor. At the end of the third income year — 30 June 1991. The income derived/expenditure incurred in NZD is therefore: as this is a positive amount it is income derived by the investor. On 30 September 1991 the bond is sold for USD 10 million (i.e. an approximate yield of 16% p.a.) At this date the USD/NZD spot rate was .6320. At this date the investor is subject to the base price adjustment of section 64F: a − (b + c) Where: a is all consideration that has been paid to the investor: b is the acquisition price of the bond: 8,300,000 / .6310 = 13,153,724 NZD c is all amounts of income derived under section 64C: So the Base Price Adjustment is a − (b + c) = 20,432,131 − (13,153,724 + 5,288,504) G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] = 1,989,903 NZD Since this is a positive amount it is income derived by the holder of the bond in this income year. EXAMPLE 2. MULTICURRENCY LOAN FACILITY WITH EARLY REPAYMENT A corporate borrower has a multi-currency loan facility that allows funds to be drawn down in any of three currencies — US Dollars (USD), Sterling (GBP) and Deutchmarks (DM). The total initial amount of the loan is $100 million USD and may be taken in any combination of the three currencies. The term of the loan is 10 years and any tranche may be repaid at any time by payment of the principal outstanding. The mixture of currencies can be changed at each six monthly interest payment date. Interest is payable in the currency of the principal amount at rates depending on the currency as shown below. The loan is initially drawn down on 1 October 1988 in the configuration below. Interest is payable six monthly in arrears on 1 February and 1 August. The corporate borrower has a 31 March balance date. Its base currency is New Zealand dollars (NZD). For taxation purposes each of these tranches is treated as a separate financial arrangement. For example, with respect to the Sterling (GBP) tranche the expenditure incurred as at 31 March 1989 is calculated as follows: The base currency is GBP. The interest payment for the four months ended 1 February 1989 in GBP 1.32m. The CTBV is equal to e + f + g − h − i. e is 0 since the corporate borrower is not a party to this financial arrangement at the beginning of this income year. f is GBP 1.32m the interest payment paid on 1 February 1989. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] g is 0 since there is no base currency income accruing to the person in this income year. h is GBP 36m (the amount drawn down) the sum of all consideration given to the corporate borrower in the income year. i is GBP 1.98m the base currency expenditure of the corporate borrower calculated in accordance with the provisions of sections 64B to 64M of the Act. The CTBV is then equal to GBP − 36.66m at 31 March 1989. Suppose that the spot rates for the conversion of GBP to NZD were .3300 GBP to 1 NZD on 1 October 1988 and .3345 GBP to 1 NZD on 1 February 1989 and .3350 GBP to 1 NZD on 31 March 1989. The income or expenditure of the corporate borrower for the year ended 31 March 1989 in respect of this financial arrangement is given by: a + b − c − d, where a is the CTBV in NZD = −36.66m / .3350 = NZD −109,432,836. b is the sum of all consideration given to the person during the financial year i.e. the amount drawn down. In NZD this is equal to 36m / 0.3300 = NZD 109,090,909. c is the value of the opening tax book value and has nil value. d is the sum of all consideration given by the corporate in the financial year, i.e. the interest payment = 1.32m / .3345 = NZD 3,946,188. The income or expenditure is then NZD −4,288,115. For the corporate borrower this negative amount is expenditure incurred in this income year. At the corporate's second balance date — 31 March 1990. The CTBV is equal to e + f + g − h − i. Where: e is GBP −36.66m the CTBV of the previous year. f is GBP 3.96m the interest payments paid on 1 August 1989 and 1 February 1990. g is nil. h is nil. G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] i is GBP 3.96m the base currency expenditure of the corporate borrower. The CTBV is then equal to GBP −36.66m at 31 March 1990. Suppose that during the year the relevant spot rates for the conversion of GBP to NZD were: .3340 GBP to 1 NZD on 1 August 1989 and .3310 GBP to 1 NZD on 1 February 1990 and .3280 GBP to 1 NZD on 31 March 1990. The income or expenditure of the corporate borrower for the year ended 31 March 1990 in respect of this financial arrangement is given by: a + b − c − d, where a is −36.66m / .3280 = NZD −111,768,292 b is nil c is NZD −109,432,836 d is 1.98m / .3340 + 1.98m / .3310 = NZD 11,910,017 The income or expenditure of the corporate borrower is then NZD −14,245,473. This negative amount is expenditure incurred in this income year. On 1 June 1990 the corporate borrower decides to switch out of GBP and borrow more USD. For the purposes of calculating the corporate's income or expenditure the GBP tranche is deemed to be repaid and is subject to the Base Price Adjustment in this income year. The spot rate GBP to NZD was .3200 on the date of repayment. The Base Price Adjustment is given in section 64F of the Act. It calculates an amount by application of the formula: a − (b + c); where a is all consideration that has been paid by the corporate borrower. This is the interest payments made plus the deemed principal repayment amount. This amount is equal to: 1.32m / .3345 + 1.98m / .3340 + 1.98m / .3310 = NZD 15,856,205 in respect of the interest amounts plus 36m / .3200 = NZD 112,500,000 in respect of the deemed principal repayment. So “a” then equals NZD 128,356,205 b is the acquisition price of the facility. This is equal to the amount of GBP drawn down i.e. 36m / .3300 = NZD 109,090,909 G9A 4 December 1989 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 14 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] c is the amounts of expenditure incurred less the amounts of income derived as calculated under section 64C . The expenditure calculated for the previous two years of the loan facility were In this case there is no income to the corporate borrower. The Base Price Adjustment is therefore: 128,356,205 − (109,090,909 + 18,533,588) = NZD 731,708 This positive amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the issuer in this income year in accordance with Section 64F(4)(b) of the Act. About this document General determinations set out the Commissioner’s view on how the financial arrangements rules apply to a specific type of financial arrangement. All general determinations are binding on the Commissioner and some are also binding on taxpayers.
1 Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach This determination may be cited as “Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach”. This determination cancels and replaces Determination G9B: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) When do you use this determination? This determination applies to financial arrangements where the rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD, including variable rate financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than NZD. However, this determination only applies to financial arrangements where the payment dates are known not later than your first balance date after you become a party to the financial arrangement, and forward rates for the currency in which the financial arrangements are denominated can be determined. You must use this determination for the 2003–04 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 2 You must use this determination for the 2004–05 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2003–04 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. You must use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year and a financial arrangement for which this determination applies if— • you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and were required to make a return of your income or expenditure for the 2004–05 income year on the basis of this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you entered the financial arrangement before the date of this determination and you have made a return of your income or expenditure for an earlier income year and the financial arrangement on the basis of Determination G9B and are required under section 90 or sections 90AC and 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make a return for the income year and the financial arrangement under this determination; • you are not a member of a group of companies and, on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, you give to the Commissioner notice in writing that you elect— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; • you are a member of a group of companies and, on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, the members of the group give to the Commissioner notice in writing of an election— (a) to use this determination; and (b) to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 3 You may not use this determination for an income year unless you are required to do so by the above paragraphs. What methods can be used to calculate income or expenditure in relation to a financial arrangement that comes within the scope of this determination? Expected Value Approach This determination sets out an expected value approach to calculate gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where any rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base currency other than NZD. This base currency might be a foreign currency or a commodity. This expected value approach can only be used for financial arrangements within the scope of this determination, which is narrower than Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. If you are required to use this determination, you must not use Determination G9A for any such financial arrangement, and you must not use Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities for any forward contract within the scope of Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Mark to Spot Approach You can use Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement within the scope of this determination if you are not required to use this determination or Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Alternatively, you may use the mark to market method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 1(6) of the Act or the market valuation method if you satisfy the requirements of section EH 36 of the Act. You may also use a method allowed by the proviso to section EH 1(6) of the Act or by section EH 38(2) of the Act. How do I use the method set out in this determination? Under this method, the gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement where the rights and obligations of the parties are expressed in a base currency other than NZD is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. To apply this method to a financial arrangement for the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must— • determine the expected component by taking into account all the base currency payments and payment dates in relation to the financial arrangement when you become a party to the financial arrangement; and 4 • use the initial interest rate to calculate the base currency payments under a variable rate financial arrangement denominated in a base currency other than NZD, and assume that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement; and • translate the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of the forward rates available at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement; and • spread the expected NZD net amount under the yield to maturity method and allocate it to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement on a daily basis; and • measure the unexpected component at the end of each balance date as the difference between actual and expected NZD payments. To apply this method for the first time to a financial arrangement for an income year after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must calculate the gross income or expenditure of the financial arrangement as set out above, except that you must— • in determining the expected component of the gross income or expenditure, use actual NZD payments up to the income year for which you first use this determination for the financial arrangement and expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement; and • in calculating the expected NZD payments, use the relevant forward rates as at the end of the income year for which you first use this determination for the financial arrangement. You must also calculate a transition allowance for a financial arrangement to which you apply the method for the first time for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement. How do I elect to use the method outlined in this determination? Election for 2003–04 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the day that is the end of your accounting period for the 2003–04 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period for the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— 5 • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Election for 2004–05 and subsequent income years If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the 2004–05 income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. Election for income years beginning after 2004–05 income year If you are not a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period for the income year. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. If you are a member of a group of companies, you may elect to use this determination for an income year beginning after the 2004–05 income year, and for subsequent income years, by giving, together with all other members of the group, a notice of election to the Commissioner on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period for the income year for a member of the group. The notice must be in writing and elect— • to use this determination; and • to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. 6 How do I calculate the transitional adjustment? A transitional adjustment must be made for the first income year for which you are required to use this determination for a forward contract if you entered the forward contract before the income year and you have not been required to apply Determination G9B for the forward contract. The calculation is comparable to Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement. The transitional adjustment requires that for the income year of the adjustment you treat as gross income or expenditure the difference between the total amount that would have been gross income or expenditure calculated as described in this determination and the total amount actually recognised over the previous income years. How is income or expenditure calculated in the year the financial arrangement matures or is disposed of? Regardless of which method you choose to use, you must calculate income or expenditure using the base price adjustment in whichever of section EH 4 and section EH 47 of the Act is applicable to the financial arrangement. Miscellaneous issues This determination requires that where a financial arrangement involves or is expressed in more than one currency or commodity, each separate currency or commodity tranche is to be treated as a separate financial arrangement. Where a facility provides for the rollover of a financial arrangement, the financial arrangement matures when the rollover occurs. Section EH 4 or section EH 47 of the Act applies in the income year the rollover occurs. Any payment arising from the rollover of a financial arrangement will be taken into account under section EH 4 or section EH 47 of the Act unless the payment is related to a separate financial arrangement. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 90(1)(c) and 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope (1) This determination applies to the calculation of gross income or expenditure from a financial arrangement, to the extent that any right or obligation under the financial arrangement is fixed or otherwise determined in a currency other than NZD and is not fixed in NZD. The payment dates under the financial arrangement must be known not later than your first balance date after you become a party to the financial arrangement. 7 (2) This determination does not apply to— (a) a futures contract; (b) a security arrangement; (c) a financial arrangement denominated in a currency where the forward rates of the currency cannot be determined; (d) any financial arrangements covered by the following determinations: Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities; Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts; Determination G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency; Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable; Determination G27: Swaps; Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and Method for Spreading Income and Expenditure; except as specifically allowed by those determinations. (3) You must use this determination for an income year for a financial arrangement that satisfies subparagraphs (1) and (2) above if— (a) the income year is the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies that makes an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the 2003–04 income year; (b) the income year is after the 2003–04 income year and— (i) you are not a member of a group of companies and make an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (ii) you are a member of a group of companies that makes an election, as described in subparagraph (4) below, that applies for the income year; (iii) you entered the financial arrangement after the date of this determination and have been required to use this determination, Determination G9B or Determination G14A for an earlier income year; (iv) you entered the financial arrangement before the date of this determination and have used Determination G9B for an earlier income year and the financial arrangement and are not excluded from the application of this determination for the income year and the financial arrangement by section 90(6) or 90AE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 8 (4) An election to use this determination must— (a) be made in writing to the Commissioner; and (b) include an election to use Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach; and (c) if you are not a member of a group of companies, be made— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the end of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the day that is the 63 rd day of your accounting period that corresponds to the income year, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 income year and for subsequent income years; and (d) if you are a member of a group of companies, be made by all the members of the group and— (i) on or before the day that is the earlier of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the end of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2003–04 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2003–04 and subsequent income years; (ii) on or before the day that is the later of 31 July 2004 and the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the 2004–05 income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for the 2004–05 and subsequent income years; (iii) on or before the earliest day that is the 63 rd day of an accounting period that corresponds to the income year for a member of the group, if the election is to apply for an income year that is after the 2004–05 income year and for subsequent income years. (5) If you must use this determination, you may not use— (a) Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement that is within subparagraphs (1) and (2) above; (b) Determination G14: Forward Contracts for Foreign Exchange and Commodities to calculate gross income or expenditure of any forward contract that is within the scope of Determination G14B: Forward contracts for foreign exchange and commodities: an expected value approach. (Note: A determination to which Determination G9C refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determination made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is extended to the new determination.) 9 4. Principle (1) If you are a party to a financial arrangement to which this determination applies, the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement is calculated by taking into account all amounts arising from the fluctuations of exchange rates or commodity prices. (2) The gross income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is the total of an expected component and an unexpected component. (3) If you must apply this determination to a financial arrangement for the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, you must measure the expected component as at the time you enter the financial arrangement. You must also recognise the unexpected component when it is realised. (4) To measure the expected component you must convert the base currency payments into expected NZD payments on the basis of forward rates at the time you enter the financial arrangement and spread the expected NZD net amount over the term of the financial arrangement. (5) You must measure the unexpected component as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. (6) If you must apply this determination for the first time to a financial arrangement for an income year that is after the income year in which you enter the financial arrangement, and you have not applied Determination G9B for the financial arrangement, you must measure the expected component as at the end of the income year. You must follow the principle set out above by calculating the expected NZD net amount using actual NZD payments up to the end of the income year in which you first apply the determination and the forward rates at the end of that income year. (7) Again, you must recognise the unexpected component when it is realised. Transitional adjustment (8) For the first income year for which you must use this determination, you must perform the transitional adjustment calculation to calculate gross income or expenditure for all financial arrangements— (a) that you entered before the income year; and (b) for which you have not been required to use Determination G9B. (9) This adjustment ensures that the gross income or expenditure up to the end of the income year in which you first use this determination is equal to that that would have been returned if the actual NZD payments and the forward rates, as described in subparagraph (4), and this determination had been used since you became a party to the financial arrangement. 10 5. Interpretation (1) In this determination, a reference to the Act is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) In this determination— base currency in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency or commodity in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed covered interest parity means the proposition that the differential between forward and spot exchange rates is equal to the interest differentials. That is, the forward rate for a foreign currency exchange at time t for 1 period ahead is equivalent to the spot rate at time t, S t , multiplied by 1 plus the foreign interest rate, i f , divided by 1 plus the domestic interest rate, i d . Forward rates at time t for n periods, Fwd t,n , can thus be derived based on the principle of covered interest parity as— (1 + i f ) n Fwd t,n = S t × (1 + i d ) n currency includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement exchange rate means the price of 1 currency expressed in another currency financial arrangement has the same meaning as in the Act: Provided that, where a financial arrangement creates obligations in 2 or more currencies or commodities and the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each of the currencies is separately identifiable, the consideration to be given and received in respect of the obligations in each currency will be treated as relating to separate financial arrangements floating rate arrangement means a financial arrangement where the interest rate is reset periodically according to a predetermined formula, linking the interest rate to an indicator rate such as the bank bill or interbank rate forward rate means the exchange rate for a forward contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or the forward exchange rate calculated using the principle of covered interest parity or other methods that are commercially acceptable. In the case where the base currency is a commodity, the forward rate is the future value of the commodity (in NZD) future value in relation to a commodity and a future date means the value of the commodity at the future date, on a given date, derived from any commercially acceptable, market-based method of valuation GBP means the currency of the United Kingdom 11 initial interest rate in relation to a financial arrangement means the interest rate that applies to the first period after the date of issue or acquisition of the financial arrangement interest means any periodic payment in relation to the financial arrangement, to the extent intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower. It does not include fees, discounts, premiums, or payments effecting a reduction of principal NZD means the currency of New Zealand period means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable, and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable reviewable rate arrangement means a financial arrangement where the interest rate is set periodically in line with market rates spot rate means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates or in the case of a commodity, the spot value (in NZD) of the commodity spot value in relation to a commodity and a day means the value of the commodity on that day derived from any commercially acceptable method of valuation USD means the currency of the United States of America variable rate financial arrangement means a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. (3) All other terms used have the meaning given to them for the purpose of the Act. 6. Method (1) Your gross income or expenditure in an income year from a financial arrangement under this determination is the total of— (a) the expected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraphs (2) to (5); and (b) the unexpected component, calculated in accordance with subparagraph (6). (2) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a financial arrangement is the income year in which you become a party to the financial arrangement, you must calculate the expected component for each income year of the remaining term of the financial arrangement as at the time you become a party to the financial arrangement. The expected component is calculated by first taking into account all base currency payments in relation to the financial arrangement. 12 (3) You must calculate the base currency payments of a variable rate financial arrangement denominated in a currency other than NZD using the initial interest rate and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. (4) You must convert the base currency payments into NZD using forward rates as at the time you became a party to the financial arrangement. (5) You must spread the expected NZD net amount using the yield to maturity method consistent with Determination G3 and, where necessary, allocate it to the income year on the basis of Determination G1A. This will give the expected component for each income year. (6) You must calculate and recognise the unexpected component for each income year. The unexpected component is the difference between the actual NZD value of the payments during the year and the expected NZD value of those payments as calculated under subparagraph (4). (7) If the first income year for which you are required to apply this determination to a financial arrangement is after the income year in which you entered the financial arrangement, and you have not been required to use Determination G9B for the financial arrangement, you must follow the method set out in subparagraphs (1) to (6) to calculate gross income or expenditure of the financial arrangement, except that— (a) the NZD net amount to be spread under subparagraph (5) consists of— (i) actual NZD payments that have occurred since you became a party to the financial arrangement until the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination; (ii) expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement; and (b) the expected NZD payments in the remaining term of the financial arrangement must be calculated on the basis of the forward rates available at the end of the first income year for which you must use this determination for the financial arrangement. Transitional adjustment for existing financial arrangements (8) You must perform a transitional adjustment calculation for the first income year for which you must use this determination to calculate gross income or expenditure of any financial arrangement if you entered the financial arrangement before the income year and have not been required to apply Determination G9B to the financial arrangement. You must perform the transitional adjustment calculation for each such financial arrangement in accordance with the following formula: 13 a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the financial arrangement b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement from the time it was entered into until the end of the income year, if this determination had applied from the time you became a party to the financial arrangement c is the sum of all income in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year. A positive net amount is gross income while a negative net amount is gross expenditure in the first income year for which you must use this determination. 7. Examples (1) A New Zealand investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2005. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2009. (2) The New Zealand investor has to calculate the expected NZD net amount on the basis of forward rates available at the time it becomes a party to the financial arrangement. It then has to spread and allocate the expected NZD net amount to the income years over the term of the financial arrangement in accordance with Determination G3 and Determination G1A. In each of those income years, the investor also has to determine the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure. The unexpected component is measured as the difference between the actual NZD payments and the expected NZD payments. Further examples are provided in the schedule. Signed on the 3 rd day of June 2004. Robin Oliver General Manager, Policy 14 Schedule: Further examples Note: In each example involving a base price adjustment, the base price adjustment is calculated on the assumption that the financial arrangement is subject to Division 2 of Part EH of the Act. The details of the calculation would differ for a financial arrangement that was subject to Division 1 of Part EH of the Act. Example A: Discounted bond A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2005. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2009. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates. The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the US (US,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the time of contract. In this simple example the (US,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6-month bond and a 5-year bond have the same rate).

The expected NZD net amount represents a yield of approximately 12% per annum over the 5-year period and the yield is spread in a way consistent with Determination G3. The value of NZD $848,432, for instance, is the expected component of the gross income for the NZ investor for the 6-month period ending 1 March 2005. 15 Date (a) USD Cash (b) Expected Cash (NZD) (c) Expected Income 1-Sep-04 −8,300,000 −13,153,724 1-Mar-05 500,000 784,846 848,432 1-Sep-05 500,000 777,372 852,533 1-Mar-06 500,000 769,968 857,381 1-Sep-06 500,000 762,635 863,020 1-Mar-07 500,000 755,372 869,494 1-Sep-07 500,000 748,178 876,855 1-Mar-08 500,000 741,052 885,155 1-Sep-08 500,000 733,995 894,450 1-Mar-09 500,000 727,004 904,800 1-Sep-09 10,500,000 15,121,690 916,268 6,700,000 8,768,389 8,768,389 6-Month YTM 7% 6% When cash is subsequently received at the relevant dates, the NZD values of the payments are likely to differ from those expected at the contract date. Where the NZD values of these subsequent payments deviate from the expected NZD values, they give rise to unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure. For example, on 1 March 2005 the actual payment was NZD $774,593 while the expected payment was NZD $784,846. The discrepancy of NZD $10,253 is the unexpected component for the period ending 30 June 2005. Date Expected Cash (NZD) Actual Cash (NZD) Unexpected Income/ Expenditure 1-Sep-04 −13,153,724 −13,153,724 1-Mar-05 784,846 774,593 −10,253 1-Sep-05 777,372 769,231 −8,141 1-Mar-06 769,968 763,359 −6,609 1-Sep-06 762,635 761,035 −1,600 1-Mar-07 755,372 759,878 4,506 1-Sep-07 748,178 781,250 33,072 1-Mar-08 741,052 783,699 42,647 1-Sep-08 733,995 813,008 79,013 1-Mar-09 727,004 813,008 86,004 1-Sep-09 15,121,690 17,073,171 1,951,480 8,768,389 2,170,119 At the first balance date – 30 June 2005 There are 2 components to the income or expenditure for the financial arrangement in this income year: the gains expected at the contract date and the unexpected losses. The expected gains as summarised above are allocated to the income year in a way consistent with Determination G1A. Therefore, the gross income or expenditure for the year ended 30 June 2005 is— 16 ($848,432) + (121/184 × $852,533) – $10,253 = $1,398,812 where NZD $1,398,812 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the second balance date – 30 June 2006 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2006 is calculated as— (63/184 × $852,533) + ($857,381) +(121/184 × $863,020) – $8,141 – $6,609 = $1,702,060 where NZD $1,702,060 is gross income of the NZ investor. At the third balance date – 30 June 2007 The gross income or expenditure at 30 June 2007 is calculated as— (63/184 × $863,020) + ($869,494) + (121/184 × $876,855) – $1,600 + $4,506 = $1,744,518 where NZD $1,744,518 is gross income of the NZ investor. On 30 September 2007 the bond is sold for USD $10,000,000 (i.e. an approximate yield of 16% pa). At this date the USD/NZD spot rate was 0.6320. At this date the investor is subject to the base price adjustment under section EH 47— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company: = 500,000/.6455 + 500,000/.6500 + 500,000/.6550 + 500,000/.6570 + 500,000/.6580 + 500,000/.6400 + 10,000,000/.6320 − 8,300,000/.6310 = $20,432,131 − $13,153,724 = NZD $7,278,407 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 1,398,812 + 1,702,060 + 1,744,518 (as calculated above) = $4,845,390 NZD expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. So the base price adjustment is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted = 7,278,407 – 4,845,390 + 0 + 0 = NZD $2,433,017. 17 Since this is a positive amount it is gross income of the NZ investor in this income year. Example B: Discounted bond entered into before the 2003-04 income year A NZ investor holds a United States Treasury Bond on its balance date of 30 June 2004. The bond has a term of 5 years and bears 10% interest payable semi-annually on 1 September and 1 March. It has a face value of USD $10,000,000. The bond was purchased at issue for USD $8,300,000 and matures on 1 September 2007. This is effectively the same as Example A except that the discounted bond was acquired on 1 September 2002. The following table presents the spot rates at the relevant dates and the forward rates at the time of contract out to the relevant dates as in Example A.

The corporate has already recognised gross income of $1,398,812 in the 30 June 2003 income year. However, the corporate has elected to adopt this determination from the 2003–04 income year. The expected NZD net amount to be spread under this determination must, therefore, be determined at the end of the 2003–04 income year. The following table summarises the actual payments from 1 September 2002 to the end of the 2003– 04 income year and the expected NZD payments for the remaining term of the financial arrangement. These expected NZD payments were calculated on the basis of the forward rates at 30 June 2004 out to the relevant dates. For the sake of simplicity, these forward rates are assumed to be the same, in this example, as those measured at the time of contract. In practice, however, the forward rates measured at the time of contract are rarely the same as the forward rates measured at a later date. 18 Date Expected Cash (NZD) Expected Income 1-Sep-02 −13,153,724 1-Mar-03 774,593 845,427 1-Sep-03 769,231 849,980 1-Mar-04 763,359 855,170 1-Sep-04 762,635 861,071 1-Mar-05 755,372 867,397 1-Sep-05 748,178 874,598 1-Mar-06 741,052 882,723 1-Sep-06 733,995 891,829 1-Mar-07 727,004 901,973 1-Sep-07 15,121,690 913,219 8,743,386 6-Month YTM 6% At the end of the 2003–04 income year, the expected NZD net amount in relation to the discounted bond is NZD $8,743,386, representing an annual yield of approximately 12%. The expected NZD net amount is spread over the term of the financial arrangement in a way consistent with Determination G3. The transitional adjustment in the 2003–04 income year is— a – b – c + d where— a is the sum of all amounts that would have been income from the time the financial arrangement was entered into until the end of the 2003–04 income year = 845,427 + 849,980 + 855,170 + 861,071 × 121/184 = $3,116,825 b is the sum of all amounts that would have been expenditure from the time the financial arrangement was entered into until the end of the 2003–04 income year = 0 c is the sum of all income in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year = $1,398,812 d is the sum of all expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement since it was acquired until the end of the previous income year =0. The net amount of NZD $1,718,013 is gross income in the 2003–04 income year. The income or expenditure in relation to the discounted bond in subsequent income years will be calculated as in Example A. The expected component of the gross income or expenditure is determined as summarised in the table above while the unexpected component is calculated as in Example A. 19 Example C: Multi-currency loan facility with early repayment A corporate borrower has a multi-currency loan facility that allows funds to be drawn down in any of three currencies—US Dollars (USD), Sterling (GBP) and Deutschemarks (DM). The total initial amount of the loan is USD $100,000,000 and may be taken in any combination of the three currencies. The term of the loan facility is 10 years and any tranche may be repaid at any time by payment of the principal outstanding. The mixture of currencies can be changed at each 6-monthly interest payment date. Interest is payable in the currency of the principal amount at rates depending on the currency as shown below. The loan is initially drawn down on 1 October 2004 in the configuration below. Interest is payable 6-monthly in arrears on 1 February and 1 August. The corporate borrower has a 31 March balance date. Its base currency is NZD. Initial drawn down configuration Currency Amount Spot rate (against USD) USD equiv Interest rate USD $55m $55m 9% GBP STG36m0.5500 $19.8m 11% DM DM60m0.4083 $24.5m 5% Total $99.3m For the purpose of illustration, the spot rates and the forward rates at the initial drawn down date out to the relevant dates for GBP/NZD are presented below. The forward rates were estimated based on the principle of covered interest parity using the interest rates in the UK (UK,I), the domestic interest rates (NZ,I) and the spot rate at the initial drawn down date. In this simple example the (UK,I) and the (NZ,I) were assumed to be 10% per annum and 8% per annum, respectively, and they remain constant throughout the entire period (assuming a horizontal yield curve so that a 6- month bond and a 10-year bond have the same rate). 20 Date Actual Spot CIP Fwd (0,t) Expected UK,I Expected NZ,I 1-Oct-04 0.3300 0.3300 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-05 0.3345 0.3332 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-05 0.3340 0.3364 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-06 0.3310 0.3396 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-06 0.3184 0.3429 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-07 0.3046 0.3462 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-07 0.3387 0.3495 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-08 0.3024 0.3529 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-08 0.2829 0.3563 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-09 0.3503 0.3597 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-09 0.3736 0.3631 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-10 0.3773 0.3666 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-10 0.3874 0.3702 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-11 0.4034 0.3737 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-11 0.4225 0.3773 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-12 0.4435 0.3809 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-12 0.4414 0.3846 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-13 0.4296 0.3883 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-13 0.3955 0.3920 0.05 0.04 1-Feb-14 0.3953 0.3958 0.05 0.04 1-Aug-14 0.3953 0.3996 0.05 0.04 1-Oct-14 0.3953 0.4034 0.05 0.04 For taxation purposes each of these tranches is treated as a separate financial arrangement. The following example illustrates the way gross income or expenditure with respect to the Sterling (GBP) tranche is calculated at the initial drawn down date and the subsequent balance dates. At the initial drawn down date – 1 October 2004 At the initial drawn down date, the expected payments in GBP and NZD over the 10- year period are as follows: 21 Date (a) GBP Cash (b) Expected Cash NZD (c) Expected Expenditure 1-Oct-04 36,000,000 109,090,909 1-Feb-05 −1,320,000 −3,961,905 4,646,006 1-Aug-05 −1,980,000 −5,886,259 4,675,141 1-Feb-06 −1,980,000 −5,830,199 4,623,561 1-Aug-06 −1,980,000 −5,774,673 4,572,173 1-Feb-07 −1,980,000 −5,719,676 4,520,960 1-Aug-07 −1,980,000 −5,665,203 4,469,909 1-Feb-08 −1,980,000 −5,611,249 4,419,003 1-Aug-08 −1,980,000 −5,557,808 4,368,227 1-Feb-09 −1,980,000 −5,504,877 4,317,565 1-Aug-09 −1,980,000 −5,452,450 4,266,999 1-Feb-10 −1,980,000 −5,400,521 4,216,513 1-Aug-10 −1,980,000 −5,349,088 4,166,088 1-Feb-11 −1,980,000 −5,298,144 4,115,706 1-Aug-11 −1,980,000 −5,247,686 4,065,347 1-Feb-12 −1,980,000 −5,197,708 4,014,993 1-Aug-12 −1,980,000 −5,148,206 3,964 ,624 1-Feb-13 −1,980,000 −5,099,175 3,914,217 1-Aug-13 −1,980,000 −5,050,612 3,863,751 1-Feb-14 −1,980,000 −5,002,511 3,813,205 1-Aug-14 −1,980,000 −4,954,868 3,762,554 1-Oct-14 −36,660,000 −90,866,409 3,711,775 Total −39,600,000 −88,488,316 88,488,316 6-Month YTM 5% 4% On 1 October 2004 the corporate borrower received GBP £36,000,000, which is equivalent to NZD $109,090,909. On 1 February 2005, the interest payment in arrears for the 4 months from the initial drawn down date amounts to GBP £1,320,000, which is equivalent to NZD $3,961,905 (valued at the relevant forward rate of 0.3332 at the initial drawn down date). The subsequent interest payments were also converted to NZD in the same way. Overall NZD net amount of $88,488,316 represent an expected yield of approximately 8% per annum. The expected yield is spread according to Determination G3 (see column (c)). The actual NZD payments will deviate from the expected NZD payments due to fluctuations in the exchange rates. For instance, the actual NZD payment on 1 February 2005 was NZD $3,946,188 instead of NZD $3,961,905 anticipated at the initial drawn down date. This created an unexpected component of NZD $15,716 for the gross income or expenditure in respect of the financial arrangement. The following table presents the unexpected component of the gross income or expenditure over the term of the financial arrangement. 22 Date Expected Cash NZD Actual Cash NZD Unexpected Income/ Expenditure 1-Oct-04 109,090,909 109,090,909 1-Feb-05 −3,961,905 −3,946,188 −15,716 1-Aug-05 −5,886,259 −5,928,144 41,885 1-Feb-06 −5,830,199 −5,981,873 151,674 1-Aug-06 −5,774,673 −6,218,593 443,920 1-Feb-07 −5,719,676 −6,500,328 780,652 1-Aug-07 −5,665,203 −5,845,881 180,678 1-Feb-08 −5,611,249 −6,547,619 936,370 1-Aug-08 −5,557,808 −6,998,940 1,441,131 1-Feb-09 −5,504,877 −5,652,298 147,421 1-Aug-09 −5,452,450 −5,299,786 −152,664 1-Feb-10 −5,400,521 −5,247,813 −152,708 1-Aug-10 −5,349,088 −5,110,996 −238,091 1-Feb-11 −5,298,144 −4,908,280 −389,865 1-Aug-11 −5,247,686 −4,686,391 −561,295 1-Feb-12 −5,197,708 −4,464,487 −733,221 1-Aug-12 −5,148,206 −4,485,727 −662,479 1-Feb-13 −5,099,175 −4,608,939 −490,237 1-Aug-13 −5,050,612 −5,006,321 −44,291 1-Feb-14 −5,002,511 −5,008,854 6,343 1-Aug-14 −4,954,868 −5,008,854 53,986 1-Oct-14 −90,866,409 −92,739,691 1,873,282 Total −88,488,316 2,616,778 At the first balance date – 31 March 2005 Expected component = 4,646,006 + (4,675,141 × 59/181) = $6,169,947. Unexpected component = $15,716. Total gross expenditure = $6,169,947 – $15,716 = $6,154,231. At the second balance date – 31 March 2006 Expected component = (122/181 × 4,675,141) + 4,623,561 + (4,572,173 × 59/181) = $9,265,138. Unexpected component = $41,885 + $151,674 = $193,559. Total gross expenditure = $9,265,138 + $193,559 = $9,458,697. 23 On 1 June 2006 the corporate borrower decides to switch out of GBP and borrow more USD. For the purpose of calculating the corporate’s gross income or expenditure, the GBP tranche is deemed to be repaid and is subject to the base price adjustment in this income year. The spot rate GBP to NZD was 0.3200 on the date of repayment. The base price adjustment is given in section EH 47 of the Act. It calculates an amount by application of the formula— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company. This is equal to the amount of GBP drawn down less the sum of the interest payments made and the deemed principal repayment amount = 36 m/.3300 − (1.32m/.3345 + 1.98 m/.3340 + 1.98m/.3310 + 36m/.3200) = NZD $109,090,909 − NZD $128,356,205 = −NZD $19,265,296 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years = 0 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years. The gross expenditure for the previous 2 years of the loan facility were— for the year ended 31 March 1989 = $6,154,231; for the year ended 31 March 1990 = $9,458,697. The total gross expenditure is 6,154,231 + 9,458,697 = NZD $15,612,928 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. The base price adjustment is therefore— –19,265,296 + 15,612,928 = −NZD $3,652,368. This amount is gross expenditure of the corporate borrower in this income year in accordance with section EH 47 of the Act. Example D: Variable rate financial arrangement This example is similar to Example D in Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements. This example illustrates how this determination could be applied to a variable rate financial arrangement. A New Zealand company purchased a USD note with a face value of $10,000 for a term of 3 years at a discount of 10% ($1,000). The interest rate is equal to market interest plus 1% pa, and interest is payable half-yearly in arrears. There are no fees. The interest rate is 10% in the first period after issue. 24 Assuming that this interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 14.2% pa, calculated at half-yearly rests.

At the second balance date The gross income consists of— Expected component = $879 + $885 = $1,764; and Unexpected component = −$83 – $78 = −$161. The gross income for the second balance date is therefore $1,603. At the final balance date The New Zealand company has to perform a base price adjustment under section EH 47 of the Act— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted where— consideration is the consideration paid or payable to the company less the consideration paid or payable by the company = 775 + 846 + 687 + 685 + 608 + 16,250 − 14,263 = NZD $5,588 income is all the amounts of gross income derived in previous income years 1,800 + 1,603 = NZD $3,403 expenditure is expenditure incurred in previous income years = 0 amount remitted is the amount of consideration remitted = 0. 26 So the base price adjustment is— consideration – income + expenditure + amount remitted = 5,588 – 3,403 + 0 + 0 = NZD $2,185. Since this is a positive amount, it is gross income of the New Zealand company in this income year.

[Child Support Amendment Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/child-support-amendment-act-2006 "Child Support Amendment Act 2006")

Determinations initiated by Inland Revenue
==========================================

2006 amendments allow IR to initiate administrative review if it considers the amount of child support payable by a parent does not accurately reflect their income.

A further set of amendments allows Inland Revenue to initiate the administrative review process if it considers that the amount of child support payable by a liable parent does not accurately reflect that parent's ability to provide financial assistance for his or her child(ren).

#### Background

The child support formula is based on taxable income, which can provide an incentive for liable parents who wish to minimise their child support liability to reduce their taxable income. Most liable parents receive a salary, wages or a benefit and thus have limited opportunity to manipulate their income in order to minimise their child support liability. However, the way in which other liable parents, such as business people and those with investment income, can structure their financial affairs means that the amount of child support they pay may not reflect their capacity to pay. The structures they use may be legal for income tax purposes and may have been adopted for legitimate reasons, such as separating business and private assets. Equally, they may have been adopted to minimise child support liabilities. Whatever the reason for the way in which liable parents structure their financial affairs, if they have the effect of reducing their taxable income, and thus their child support liability, the intent of the Child Support Act, that parents contribute to their children's support according to their capacity to pay, is defeated.

Custodians can already deal with this problem by seeking a departure from an assessment if they consider that special circumstances exist that make the amount payable by the liable parent unfair. The administrative review process is a low-cost, informal process which is carried out by independent people, experienced in law and contracted to Inland Revenue, who follow precedents set by past court cases. However, for a variety of reasons, including a lack of knowledge of the liable parent's current financial position, custodians may fail to seek a departure.

#### Key features

The intention behind Part 6B is to allow Inland Revenue to identify cases where it considers that liable parents have a greater capacity to contribute to their children's financial support than that arising from basing their liability on their taxable income. Inland Revenue will thus be considering just one of the 10 grounds on which a departure may be granted. However, both the liable parent and the custodian may make an application under the existing provisions in Part 6A on any of the other grounds, and the liable parent may also raise the financial position of the other parent and/or child.

Case selection will occur by applying set criteria (which will not be made publicly available) against information held by Inland Revenue. No distinction in case selection will be made on the basis that the custodian is, or is not, a beneficiary. While information from custodians will be accepted, and fed into the case selection process, it will not be the single determinant of whether a liable parent is selected for review. Likewise, information referred by staff or Review Officers will also feed into the selection process. It is expected that self-employed liable parents will form the bulk of those investigated. However, liable parents who earn salaries or wages will also be included if any evidence is received that their capacity to pay child support is not reflected by their taxable income.

Inland Revenue will use its powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to establish what it considers to be a liable parent's full financial position. These powers include:

*   requiring liable parents to provide any information that Inland Revenue requires, such as details of any financial interest in any entity which is not reflected in their income tax returns, recent dispositions of assets, and the like;
*   if there are doubts about the veracity of the information supplied, requiring the liable parent to make a statutory declaration; and
*   if the information is not supplied, seeking a court order to require the liable parent to supply the information.

From the information gathered in this way, plus any other information to which Inland Revenue has access, a summary of the liable parent's income, assets, liabilities, any indirect interests in other tax entities and any other relevant information (such as whether a new partner is financially independent of the liable parent) will be prepared. This summary will be supplied to the liable parent, and a period will be allowed for the liable parent to raise any concerns he or she has with Inland Revenue. An amended summary will be issued if Inland Revenue agrees with the liable parent. Should liable parents not accept that the summary truly represents their financial position, their reasons for holding that view may be set out in writing and this will be attached to the summary.

Once the information is agreed (or a statement of disagreement is received from the liable parent), a notice will be sent to both the custodian and the liable parent advising that Inland Revenue intends to initiate the review process. The liable parent (but not the custodian) will also receive a summary of the information on which Inland Revenue has based its decision. At this stage, the custodian will have three choices: to ask Inland Revenue not to proceed (non-beneficiary custodians only); to become a party to the proceedings; or to accept the outcome of the review without becoming a party to the proceedings.

The usual review process will then follow. Review Officers will consider the summary provided by Inland Revenue, together with any submissions made by the liable parent and/or the custodian, and reach a conclusion based on existing case law as to whether the child support assessment ought to be amended. As with any administrative review, the liable parent and the custodian will each have the opportunity to appear before the Review Officer in person (or by telephone if this is more convenient). The liable parent will still have the choice of not participating but, should this happen, the Review Officer will be able to recommend a departure on the basis of the information contained in the summary. Inland Revenue will not make any further representations to the Review Officer, although Review Officers will be able to seek clarification of any item included in the summary and/or further information from Inland Revenue.

As with any other administrative review, the first step will be to establish that "special circumstances" exist. Once that test has been met, any adjustment to the child support liability will still need to be "just and equitable" and "otherwise proper".

As with the existing review process, if it is relevant to the decision, information (other than that relating to a third party, such as the income of the liable parent's new partner) on which the decision is based may be included in the information supplied to both the liable parent and the custodian.

As departures from the formula assessment are not limited to just the current year, it is envisaged that any departure made under Part 6B will usually be made for a number of years. That is to prevent Inland Revenue having to review the same cases year after year until child support ceases to be payable for the child(ren). If a liable parent or custodian is unhappy with the outcome of the review, he or she will be able to lodge an appeal in the Family Court against the decision (with the usual appeal rights to a higher court). However, Inland Revenue will not be able to lodge an appeal but will automatically be a party to the proceedings.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from 26 September 2006

[Research & development](/new-legislation/act-articles/research-development "Research & development")

Determinations, record keeping, no exemption, use-of-money interest and penalties and refunds of surplus credits not subject to GST (sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994)
=================================================================================================================================================================================

Research and development tax credits in relation to applying for a determination, record keeping, exemptions from filing returns, penalties and more.

#### Determinations (sections 91AAP and 91C(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

Businesses that are uncertain about their eligibility for the tax credit will be able to apply for a determination of whether:

*   they meet the eligibility criteria in section LH 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007;
*   their expenditure or depreciation loss meets the requirements of the definition of "eligible expenditure" in section LH 4; and
*   their activity meets the requirements of the definition of "research and development activities" in section LH 7.

Businesses will not be able to obtain binding rulings about these matters.

There will be regulations to prescribe how businesses should apply for a determination on these matters. The determinations will be binding on the Commissioner, from the date the determination is signed by the Commissioner, but not binding on the person who applies for the determination.

When there is an amendment to or repeal of the law relevant to the determination, and it would detrimentally affect the business to continue relying on the determination, the determination does not have to be relied on.

Where the applicant has misrepresented or omitted facts relevant to the determination, whether intentionally or not, the determination is no longer binding and cannot be relied upon.

Inland Revenue may withdraw the determination by notice, at which point it can no longer be relied upon. There is an exception, however - when the business is already undertaking an activity in reliance on the determination, and was doing so before the notice of withdrawal, the business can continue to rely on the determination as originally set down for the activity.

A determination may not be disputed or challenged.

The ability to apply for a determination will not be available immediately. The provision allowing for determinations will come into force by Order in Council, no later than 1 April 2010.

#### Record-keeping (sections 22(2) and 22(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

Claimants must keep sufficient records to support their claim for an R&D tax credit. For a business, general record-keeping requirements are laid out in detail in section 22(1). An entity which does not derive assessable income is expected to keep records of a similar standard to support its claim for a tax credit.

In addition, all entities claiming a tax credit will be expected to keep a wider range of records than specified in section 22(1). For example, non-accounting documents such as project plans or test-reports might be required to provide evidence of a systematic, investigative and experimental approach to an activity.

Listed research providers must keep additional records to show that they meet the requirements of section LH 15(2) and (3) of the Income Tax Act 2007, and to show the amounts derived and incurred by them in performing R&D activities on behalf of other persons.

#### No exemption from filing an annual return of income (sections 33A(2) and 43A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

A business that has a tax credit under section LH 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 must file a return of income for the year the credit relates to. The exemption from filing in section 33A does not apply to a person who claims the tax credit.

A non-active company which has a tax credit under section LH 2 ceases to be a non-active company and must file an income tax return.

#### Use-of-money interest and penalties (section 141(7C) of the Tax Administration Act 1994)

Use-of-money interest and penalties generally apply to amounts of tax credit as they would apply to other amounts of tax.

However, there is an exception to the normal shortfall penalty rules, applying only to internal software development groups. When the members of an internal software development group reallocate the credits for internal software development undertaken by the group, there will not be a shortfall as long as the reallocations are offsetting. This recognises that group members who file a tax return early might not yet know the internal software development expenditure of other group members.

##### Example: Reallocation of credits for internal software development (no shortfall)

Company A and Company B, standard balance date companies, are members of an internal software development group from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009.

The following expenditure is undertaken:

*   Company A spends $1 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $2 million on internal software development in the period from 1 October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company A also spends $6 million on other R&D over theyear.
*   Company B spends $0.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1 April 2008 to 30 September 2008, and $1.5 million on internal software development in the period from 1October 2008 to 31 March 2009. Company B also spends $4 million on other R&D over the year.

Company A files its tax return on 1 May 2009, claiming a tax credit for $8,495,890 of R&D expenditure ($1 million of internal software development expenditure before it was part of the group, $1,495,890 of internal software development expenditure afterwards, and $6 million for other R&D expenditure). This gives a total credit of $1,274,383.

Company B files its tax return on 1 July 2009, claiming a tax credit for $4.5 million of R&D (internal software development expenditure of $0.5 million incurred before it was part of the group, and $4 million of other R&D expenditure). This gives a total tax credit of $675,000. Company B would also like to claim for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, but is aware that the group's expenditure cap has been reached.

Company B negotiates with Company A. Company A files a notice of proposed adjustment and reduces its claims for tax credits by $90,000 (relating to eligible expenditure on internal software development of $600,000). Company B files a notice of proposed adjustment and increases its claim for tax credits by $90,000. The Commissioner makes both adjustments. Because $90,000 is less than the credits Company A received for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group, and because Company B is entitled to more than $90,000 of credits for internal development expenditure incurred while in the group, Company A has no tax shortfall

The provision only applies when there is reallocation of credits for internal software development expenditure incurred while in the group. It allows neither reallocation of any credits for expenditure incurred outside the group nor reallocation of any credits for expenditure which is not on internal software development. The business that is allocated a greater amount of credits must also have sufficient eligible expenditure relating to internal software development undertaken while in the group to justify those credits.

#### Refunds of surplus credits not subject to GST (section 6 of the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies Order) 1992)

A refund of surplus tax credits under section LH 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is not subject to GST.

Clerk of the Executive Council. Explanatory note This note is not part of the order but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order, which comes into force on XX 2024 and is revoked on 31 March 2025, modifies the application date for new adjustment rules in section 21FB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Those rules came into force on 1 April 2023 by section 143(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 (the 2023 Act). The modification applies retrospectively, from 1 April 2023. The new adjustment rules allow for one-off adjustments for the purposes of determin‐ ing goods and services tax (GST) adjustments for assets that have a permanent change of use. Tax Administration (GST Adjustment Rules) Modification Order 2024Explanatory note 3 PCO 26544 v 2.0: 24 July 2024: 3:10 p.m. Section 143(3) of the 2023 Act says that the new adjustment rules apply from adjust‐ ment periods starting on or after 1 April 2023, which means that they may not apply when an asset was acquired before 1 April 2023 (as the acquisition date of the asset marks the beginning of an adjustment period). This application provision prevents taxpayers from being able to benefit from the new adjustment rules if they acquired an asset before 1 April 2023 and started using it to make taxable supplies on or after 1 April 2023. The effect of the modification in clause 6 of this order is that taxpayers should be able to apply the new adjustment rules after 1 April 2023 (when the amending legislation came into force), including for assets acquired before this date. Statement of reasons Minister’s reasons for recommending modification This statement of the Minister’s reasons for recommending the making of this order is published in accordance with section 6D(7) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Minister of Revenue is satisfied that— •the modification is reasonably necessary to give effect to the intended purpose or object of a provision in the Inland Revenue Acts: •the modification does not materially affect the intended scope or effect of the provision to which it applies: •the modification is not inconsistent with the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision: •the modification is the most appropriate way of addressing or resolving the issue at the time: •the modification is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address or resolve the issue that gave rise to it: •where the modification applies to a person unless they choose not to apply it, the person has a reasonable opportunity to choose not to apply it: •a consultative process has been undertaken on the proposed modification and explanation of the way in which it complies with the requirements of the Act: •the modification will not, in substance, have the effect of extending the period for which a modification previously made, or exemption previously granted, under the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. Modification is reasonably necessary to give effect to intended purpose or object of provision in Inland Revenue Acts The Minister considers that the intended purpose or object of new section 21FB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (a simplified GST adjustment calculation) was for it to be available for taxpayers who acquired an asset before being registered for GST. This is in the same way that it would be available for taxpayers who were registered for GST at the time they acquired an asset. The purpose or object was that, in both Explanatory note Tax Administration (GST Adjustment Rules) Modification Order 2024 4 PCO 26544 v 2.0: 24 July 2024: 3:10 p.m. cases, new section 21FB would apply to any permanent change in use and allow an adjustment to be made in one adjustment period rather than two adjustment periods under the old rules. The unintended effect of the way the application provision for new section 21FB was drafted (section 143(3) of the 2023 Act) was that the simplified GST adjustment cal‐ culation is unavailable for taxpayers who acquired an asset before 1 April 2023 and who were not using that asset for making taxable supplies until on or after 1 April 2023. This includes taxpayers who acquired an asset before 1 April 2023 and who were not registered for GST at the time they acquired the asset. The Minister con‐ siders that this effect was not intended at the time the legislation came into force, as the simplified GST adjustment calculation was intended to be available for taxpayers to apply in their GST returns for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. This timing coincided with when the 2023 Act came into force. Modification does not materially affect intended scope or effect of provision to which it applies The Minister considers that the modification made by the order corrects an uninten‐ ded outcome caused by the application provision (section 143(3) of the 2023 Act) for the simplified GST adjustment calculation in new section 21FB . The modification allowed for by the order enables affected taxpayers to apply the simplified GST adjustment calculation as intended. Modification is not inconsistent with purpose or object of relevant provision The Minister considers that the intended purpose or object of the relevant provision was to allow taxpayers to apply the simplified GST adjustment calculation in GST returns for taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. This was to align with when the 2023 Act, and therefore the simplified GST adjustment calculation, came into force. Modification is most appropriate way of addressing or resolving issue at time The Minister has agreed to include a permanent remedial amendment in upcoming legislation, which is yet to be introduced to the House of Representatives. This remedial legislation will resolve the issue in the primary legislation. However, until the remedial legislation has passed into law, taxpayers and the Inland Revenue Department are unable to apply the law as was intended. The Minister considers it undesirable to wait for amending legislation to pass, as this will delay taxpayers’ entitlements to GST input tax deductions. The modification made by the order will allow taxpayers and the Inland Revenue Department to process GST adjustments con‐ sistent with the policy intent of the simplification measures, and in anticipation of remedial legislation becoming law. Tax Administration (GST Adjustment Rules) Modification Order 2024Explanatory note 5 PCO 26544 v 2.0: 24 July 2024: 3:10 p.m. Modification is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address or resolve issue that gave rise to it The Minister considers that the modification in the order is not broader than is reason‐ ably necessary to address or resolve the issue that gave rise to it. This is because the modification in the order only allows affected taxpayers to apply the simplified GST adjustment calculation in new section 21FB of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in taxable periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. When modification applies to person unless they choose not to apply it, person has a reasonable opportunity to choose not to apply it The modification will apply to taxpayers who have already taken a tax position in a GST return that is consistent with the modification. The Minister is satisfied that these taxpayers will have a reasonable opportunity to choose not to apply the modifi‐ cation, as they can ask the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to amend their assess‐ ment in a manner that is inconsistent with the modification, if they choose for it not to apply. Consultative process has been undertaken as required by Act The Minister consulted on a draft order that included the proposed modification and an explanation of the way the modification would comply with the requirements of section 6D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 between X July 2024 and Y August 2024. The Minister decided a two-week period of consultation to be appropriate in the circumstances because of the urgency of the situation for affected taxpayers. Modification will not, in substance, have effect of extending period for which modification previously made, or exemption previously granted, applies The Minister is satisfied of this criterion because no modification has previously been made, and no exemption has previously been granted, under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to address or resolve this issue. Other The Inland Revenue Department will publish guidance on the modification, its effect, and how affected taxpayers can choose to apply it or not to apply it. This guidance will be included on the Inland Revenue Department’s website. Issued under the authority of the Legislation Act 2019. Date of notification in Gazette: This order is administered by the Inland Revenue Department.

Diaries result in restaurateur being jailed for three years for tax evasion
===========================================================================

**15 October 2014**

An Auckland restaurateur whose company evaded more than one million dollars of tax has been jailed for three years.

Khalid Mehmood was sentenced at Manukau District Court this morning after pleading guilty to 144 charges of filing false PAYE, GST and income tax returns for Areeb Khan Foods Limited between 2005 and 2010.

Inland Revenue Investigations and Advice Manager, Tony Morris said it was eight diaries seized by Inland Revenue in 2011 which were his undoing.

The diaries revealed that between April 2005 and September 2010, Mehmood's Salateen Indian Cuisine restaurant in Papatoetoe, and the Kebabs Salateen restaurants in Manukau, and Ward Street in Hamilton, made $2.7million more in sales than what Mehmood declared. He also failed to disclose cash wages he paid to staff.

"Mehmood registered all three of his restaurants for income tax, GST and PAYE." said Mr Morris. "He was fully aware of the rules and knew his actions were illegal.

"The tax returns Mehmood filed were based only on the deposits made to the company bank accounts and staff wages paid by cheque. They failed to show that significant amounts of the restaurants takings were being used to pay cash wages or by Mehmood for his own private use," he said.

Mehmood failed to declare more than $200,000 of income tax, almost $600,000 in PAYE and more than $300,000 of GST.

"Mehmood systematically set out to make gains for himself and his employees to the detriment of other taxpayers," said Mr Morris. "Not content to stop with tax, Mehmood was instrumental in enabling his staff to take advantage of social policy benefits including Working for Family tax credits, income tested benefits and low income housing benefits they were not entitled to.

"Inland Revenue laid charges against Mehmood in 2012, but he made every effort to waste taxpayers' money by delaying prosecution proceedings for almost two years whilst continuing to run his businesses. By putting his assets into other names, he also deliberately hindered Inland Revenue from recovering the tax he owes.

"Mehmood intentionally tried to beat the system by signing declarations stating the content of his tax returns were true. He was caught and we are taking action to recover the money owed.

"In trying to steal taxpayer money from Inland Revenue, Mehmood attempted to cheat New Zealanders who abide by the rules. The money he sought to claim is that used to pay for essential services like schools, police and hospitals," said Mr Morris.

Digital by default
==================

One of the key aims of transformation was to make tax and social policy payments as simple and painless as possible.

We have made big improvements to our digital services to make it easy for customers to understand their tax and social policy obligations and entitlements in ird.govt.nz and manage and track them in their myIR account.

We have also significantly increased our ability to exchange data with other organisations through digital channels that support our digital service providers. We can now partner more easily with other organisations to deliver services through them and make more of the information we hold easily and securely available to them.

Here are the important things we learned along the way.

Work out what you are doing for who and why
-------------------------------------------

The first step is to focus on the outcomes you want to achieve from your digital channels. What opportunities do you want to make the most of or what problems are you trying to solve?

Work out what success looks like so you can clearly outline what you’re trying to achieve and why. Decide what is success for your organisation, your customers, your stakeholders, and your team. Work backwards from that point on how you will achieve it.

Make sure you have a clear understanding of the purpose of your digital channels. Of all the ways customers can interact with a large organisation, why would they use one channel instead of another? This will help you to avoid costly and unnecessary duplication across channels.

Avoid coming up with technology solutions for as long as possible so that you can focus on answering these questions.

Focus on what’s most important
------------------------------

Work out what will deliver the most value so that you know what the real priorities are. You will need a good framework to do this.

Some things are important to a few people but they are actually not important at all in the bigger picture. Some important people might think some things are important, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are.

Recognise that you already hold a lot of data that if properly analysed will let you know a lot about your customers and how they use your existing channels – what they do and don’t do in them, where they get things right and where they get stuck. This will help you to identify the most important things to work on.

If you try and do everything for everyone in all channels you will need to do more design, it will be harder to focus your efforts on the truly important things and harder for your customers to find and do what is important to them.

Encourage a ‘less is more’ and ‘close enough is good enough’ approach. This will help to avoid the traps of perfectionism and designing for exceptions rather than the majority.

Give your teams license to prioritise and say no to low-value things.

Remember it’s about changing customer behaviour
-----------------------------------------------

The focus should be on helping customers to do things differently and better, not about developing widgets and functions.

You need to understand what using digital services and channels will mean for your customers and what changes they will need to make to use them. Delivering something new is just the start of changing customer behaviour. A great service might never get used if you don’t provide the right support to customers so that they know what to do.

Always keep in mind that technology is a means to an end. New, flash technology is worthless if it doesn’t change customer behaviour. Simple and usable beats fancy and complex every time.

Build a team that can get the job done
--------------------------------------

Make sure you have people on your team who are curious and have inquiring minds, make decisions based on data and solid analysis, are creative and can think logically about how to solve problems. Do the right thing by customers, but not at the expense of the organisation’s objectives and principles.

Create an environment that focuses on getting work done to the highest level of quality possible as quickly as possible. This will help to avoid endless redesign.

Encourage different views so that the best solution can be found. Pick partners that know things you don’t and allow them to make a positive difference. Whoever leads the team needs to listen and then be empowered to make the final call about how to move forward.

The right governance arrangements will help to set your people and their leaders up for success, give them the licence to make decisions, and the support they need.

[Governance forums](/about-us/business-transformation/where-we-started/governance-forums)

Find ways to give customers a voice
-----------------------------------

Take time to understand what different groups of customers value in digital channels, what they find difficult, and what they want to be able to do. A 1-size-fits all approach is unlikely to deliver the best results.

This includes understanding the individual and business life events of your customers and the solutions they naturally rely on in these situations. This will help you to decide whether you need to invest in your own channels or build your functionality into others’ solutions.

Design should be collaborative and based on what “good enough” looks like, shaped by what customers, stakeholders and your people think. Open your design up to challenge and make sure you can clearly say why you have chosen to do things in a certain way.

Use fit-for-purpose customer engagement processes such as co-design, co-refine, design validation, beta releases and A/B testing. This will help you get the input you need to design the right solution. Adapt your approach and the effort you invest in engagement depending on how complex the solution you are designing is and how complex the needs of your customers are.

You always have to balance the cost and time needed for engaging with customers against the value you think you will get from doing it. If you don’t have the time or money to adjust your solutions based on customer feedback, don’t waste your time or your customers’ time on engaging with them.

Design does not stop with delivery as it’s very rarely right first time. You will need to make changes following launch, so ensure you have a way to get customer feedback on an on-going basis.

Be pragmatic
------------

There will always be constraints on and limits to what you can achieve. This might be because of the technology you’re using, your own or your partners’ capabilities and priorities, or how complex stakeholder management is. When the pressure is on to deliver, this can lead to frustration.

Build a realistic and shared understanding of your constraints and the risks of the environment you are working in. Work out what you can influence and what you need to accept. Your team will then be able to focus on the things they can change, rather than the things they can’t, which will help to create a positive working environment and keep things moving forward.

Make sure you can scale your approach
-------------------------------------

You need to establish processes and practices that enable you to work at scale, quickly to deliver high-quality outcomes. Pattern libraries, test automation and standardised customer testing processes do require an initial investment but will ultimately reduce the cost of delivery and the time it takes to deliver.

They can also help you to efficiently maintain or improve solutions once they have been launched.

Pick the toolset that supports sustainably working at high velocity with high quality and make sure it can be extended and adapted as needed.

Expect and prepare for roadblocks
---------------------------------

You can expect disruptions because of:

*   new or late-breaking customer input
*   failed customer tests
*   flawed design assumptions
*   cross-programme dependencies and delays resulting in periods of real pressure.

You can also expect varied and often conflicting stakeholder opinions about solutions. Be ready to invest time in engaging with different stakeholders on critical aspects of the design.

Embracing informed rework as an essential and necessary part of the delivery process, rather than a painful bind, is important. Your team should be able to rely on the outcomes you are trying to achieve to help them work out how to adapt solutions as required, but always with an eye on the overall delivery timeline.

Also, be ready for pinch points to deal with peaks in workload, backlogs, and cross-team dependencies. Having a team that can mobilise around these pinch-points and structure, visualise and prioritise work will really help focus effort.

Digital
=======

One of the key aims of transformation was to make tax and social policy payments as simple and painless as possible.

Our intention was to move high-volume, simple transactions online so we could free our people up to help customers with more complex needs. However, we also recognised that, despite uptake of digital services, there would always be customers unable or unwilling to use them or who needed to contact us for other reasons.

Remaining inclusive
-------------------

Phone calls and appointments continue to be a key part of our service offering and are available to customers in these situations. Through transformation, we have invested in ensuring that our contact centres, our Community Compliance teams, and front-of-house teams in our offices have continued to be able to support customers. This has been in addition to the investment we have made in digital channels.

Improving digital channels
--------------------------

We made big improvements to our digital services to make it easy for customers to understand their obligations and entitlements in www.ird and manage and track their tax and social policy affairs in their myIR account. We made sure we had a clear view of the outcomes we wanted to achieve, the purpose of our digital channels and what customers valued in them, and what success would look like. We avoided coming up with technology solutions for as long as possible so that we could focus on answering these questions.

We focused on the things that would deliver the most value to customers by helping customers to do things differently and better. If you try to do everything, you will not be able to focus on the really important things. We encouraged a less-is-more and close-enough-is-good-enough approach. This helps to avoid the traps of perfectionism and designing for exceptions rather than the majority.

Changing customer behaviour
---------------------------

It’s important to understand what using digital services and channels will mean for customers and what changes they will need to make to use them. Delivering something new is just the start of changing customer behaviour. A great service might never get used if customers do not get the right support so that they know what to do. New, flash technology is worthless if it doesn’t change customer behaviour. Simple and usable beats fancy and complex every time.

Working with third parties
--------------------------

We also significantly increased our ability to exchange data with other organisations through digital channels that support our digital service providers. We can now partner more easily with other organisations to deliver services through them and make more of the information we hold easily and securely available to them. This meant building our capability to work with third parties and to ensure we built their development timelines into our plans.

Director's liability for asset stripping under section HD 15
============================================================

2015 case note - considers a director's liability as agent for a company under the asset stripping provisions - section HD 15, bankruptcy, Official Assignee.

Case

TRA 021/11 \[2015\] NZTRA 20

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) upheld the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) assessment of a director as agent for companies pursuant to s HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”). In finding the director liable, the Authority considered arrangements had been entered into which resulted in the companies not meeting their tax liability to the Commissioner. The Authority also considered a number of issues in relation to the director’s bankruptcy and ultimately concluded that the director had no standing to bring the tax challenge, as the challenge vests in the Official Assignee.

### Impact

This is a significant case as it considers a director’s liability as agent for a company under the asset stripping provisions under s HD 15 of the ITA (and s 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GSTA”)).

### Facts

The disputant commenced challenge proceedings after he was assessed under s 61 of the GSTA as agent for three companies, AB 1 Limited, AB 3 Limited and AB Ventures Limited (“the Companies”), which were placed into liquidation on 30 June 2010 for goods and services tax (“GST”) liabilities totalling $1,779,568.

The matter initially came before the Authority on 31 October 2012 following which, further matters were raised and eventually heard on 24 August 2015.

Property Limited was incorporated in 1997 and acted as the GST group representative member under s 55 of the GSTA for a number of companies that were part of the Property Group of Companies (“the GST Group”). The disputant was managing director of Property Limited until the company was liquidated in July 2010. The Companies were included in the GST Group and the disputant was also the managing director of the Companies.

By April 2008, Property Limited and a number of its subsidiaries had substantial outstanding liabilities to creditors. Property Limited was also owed significant amounts by some of its subsidiary companies including AB 1 Limited, AB 3 Limited and AB Ventures Limited. The directors of Property Limited decided to sell certain assets of its subsidiaries to generate funds to pay the debts of Property Limited. The disputant negotiated the agreements for sale and purchase of the assets.

In July 2006, Property Limited provided a financial guarantee to a finance company in relation to the indebtedness of the largest subsidiary in the GST Group. In July 2008 the subsidiary was placed in receivership.

After taking legal advice, the disputant and other directors decided to incorporate PQR Holdings Limited (“PQR”) and for that company to acquire shares in certain subsidiaries of Property Limited and to acquire, by way of assignment, the intercompany debts owed by those subsidiaries to Property Limited. PQR was incorporated on 1 August 2008. The disputant was its sole director.

On 4 August 2008, Property Limited and PQR entered into a Deed of Assignment assigning debts. To secure these debts, the Companies granted mortgages over the land contained in the various certificates of title that were subject to the sale and purchase agreements. On 6 August 2008, GST invoices were issued by the solicitors acting for the Companies. Each of the sale and purchase agreements settled on 14 August 2008.

The disputant in his capacity as managing director of each of the Companies, Property Limited and PQR made the decision to apply the net proceeds to pay the inter-company debts, which had been assigned to PQR. He subsequently used those funds to pay certain debts of Property Limited and some of its subsidiaries.

On 23 October 2008, Property Limited and PQR entered into a deed titled “Agreement” signed by the disputant as director of Property Limited and as director of PQR. After the net proceeds had been paid to PQR there were no remaining funds or assets left in the Companies to pay the GST liabilities.

The Companies failed to comply with statutory demands served on them by the Commissioner. In June 2010, the High Court made orders putting each of the Companies into liquidation.

On 25 August 2009, the disputant was assessed as agent. In 2010 the disputant was subsequently adjudicated bankrupt and the present challenge proceedings were issued by the disputant in May 2011.

### Decision

**_Jurisdiction_**

Regarding the extent of the Authority’s jurisdiction, Judge Sinclair initially considered and dismissed a number of the disputant’s arguments contending that the Authority has no power to make orders. Judge Sinclair then concluded that the disputant, as an un-discharged bankrupt, had no standing to bring the challenge.

_Effect of s 76 of the Insolvency Act 2006_

Judge Sinclair agreed with the Commissioner that a tax challenge is not a proceeding to recover a debt that would be halted by s 76 of the Insolvency Act 2006 (“IA 2006”) and noted a similar view taken in _Case H85_ (1985) 8 NZTC 592 at 596. For that reason s 76 of the IA 2006 was not relevant to this case.

_Contingent debt prior to adjudication_

Judge Sinclair referred to _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,718 (CA) at \[58\] regarding assessments remaining valid until set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, which is supported by the clear policy that underpins s 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”).

Her Honour agreed with the Commissioner that the TAA contemplates a tax debt being an actual debt despite a challenge to the underlying assessment being on foot.

_Position on bankruptcy_

Judge Sinclair considered that there was no merit in the disputant’s argument that a further contingency arose on bankruptcy. The disputant argued that as the Commissioner’s proof of debt had not been accepted or rejected by the Official Assignee (as no funds were available for distribution), no debt survived the adjudication of bankruptcy.

_Disputant’s standing to bring these proceedings_

Judge Sinclair looked at the status of the bankrupt’s property following adjudication and citing s 101 of the IA 2006 where it is defined as meaning “property of every kind, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, and includes rights, interests, and claims of every kind relation to property however they arise”.

Her Honour stated she was satisfied that the right of the disputant to issue challenge proceedings passed to the Official Assignee on the disputant’s bankruptcy pursuant to s 101(1) of the IA 2006.

Judge Sinclair held that it was apparent that the Official Assignee did not assign or otherwise consent to the disputant issuing challenge proceedings. Furthermore, Her Honour held that the right to issue these challenge proceedings vested in the Official Assignee and the disputant has no standing to bring these proceedings.

**_Section 61 of the GSTA and s HD 15 of the ITA_**

In the event that the Authority was wrong on the standing issue, Judge Sinclair went on to consider the application of s 61 of the GSTA. Her Honour held that the requirements of s 61 of the GSTA were met and that the Commissioner was correct in treating the disputant as an agent of the Companies and in assessing him as jointly and severally liable for the Companies’ respective GST liabilities.

_Was an “arrangement” entered into?_

Judge Sinclair considered both the definition of “arrangement” in s YA1 of the ITA and the meaning of “arrangement” considered in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2009\] 2 NZLR 289, 331 at \[105\]).

The disputant contended in the present case that there was no relevant arrangement because the payments:

1.  discharged debts owing to PQR which existed prior to any alleged arrangement being entered into; 
2.  were the result of a unilateral decision by the disputant to prefer the debts rather than to pay the funds to the disputant.

_Payment of pre-existing debts_

Her Honour agreed with the Commissioner that while the Companies had pre-existing debts, which they owed to Property Limited, they did not have pre-existing debts owing to PQR. Those debts arose only after the debts had been assigned to PQR as part of the Arrangement.

_Unilateral decision_

Judge Sinclair considered _Peterson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] 1 NZLR 450 (CA) at \[43\] and \[50\] where the Privy Council had considered whether an arrangement requires a consensus or meeting of the minds between the parties involved. The Judge noted that the Court of Appeal in _Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2012\] NZCA 128, (2012) 25 NZTC 201,120 had held that there was still an arrangement where one taxpayer acted unilaterally in circumstances where he controlled all of the entities and was the architect of the overall plan \[101\].

Her Honour held the disputant is the director and consequently controlling mind of all the relevant companies involved in the various transactions making up the arrangement. Her Honour also held that the transactions were closely connected; they all occurred over a relatively short period and formed part of an overall plan. She went on to find that the disputant also played an active role in the implementation of various transactions.

Judge Sinclair found that for the purposes of s 61 of the GSTA, an arrangement was entered into involving each of the Companies and consisting of transactions collectively referred to as the “arrangement”.

_Was it an effect of the arrangement that each company cannot meet a tax liability?_ 

Judge Sinclair adopted the approach in _Auckland Harbour Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,433 at 15,451 where Richardson P had stated that the word “effect” had its standard meaning of “the end accomplished or achieved”, and that the word “effect” should be similarly interpreted in s 61 of the GSTA.

Her Honour stated that the sale of the properties converted the Companies’ assets from one form to another. The net sale proceeds were then stripped from the Companies under the arrangement. After the transactions that made up the arrangement had been completed, the Companies were unable to satisfy their GST liabilities. Judge Sinclair agreed with the Commissioner’s submission that this was the effect of the arrangement.

_Is it reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is that a company cannot meet a tax liability?_

Her Honour noted that s HD 15(1)(c)(1) of the ITA uses the indefinite article “a purpose of the arrangement” and that accordingly, if any purpose of the arrangement was to have the effect of depleting the assets of the company, that purpose is sufficient.

Judge Sinclair noted that the principles relevant to determining the purpose of an arrangement have not been considered by any Court in respect of s 61 of the GSTA and applied the approach of the Supreme Court in _Glenharrow Holdings Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 when dealing with an arrangement in the avoidance context.

Her Honour stated that viewed objectively it is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement in this case was the effect that the Companies cannot meet their respective GST liability.

_Is it reasonable to conclude that if the disputant made reasonable enquiries he could have anticipated at the time that the GST liability would or would likely be required to be met?_

Judge Sinclair held that it is reasonable to conclude if the disputant as director of the Companies at the time of the arrangement had made reasonable enquiries he would have anticipated that the GST liabilities arising would, or would likely, be required to be met.

Discovery rights remain notwithstanding the evidence exclusion rule
===================================================================

2010 case note - compatibility of CIR's investigative powers and right to discovery - section 17 notices, evidence exclusion rule.

Case

Radio Works Ltd, TV Works Ltd v CIR

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules

### Summary

The applicant sought a review of the decision of Associate Judge Abbott who ordered discovery in a challenge of the Commissioner's assessments. The High Court declined to overturn the orders noting that the Commissioner notwithstanding various disputes process provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") is as entitled to discovery as any other litigant.

### Impact of decision

The Court confirmed the "sea change" in tax litigation and discovery (_BNZ Investments_) and the compatibility of the Commissioner's investigative powers with his right to discovery. The court confirmed that section 138G should be read together with section 89M which only requires an "outline" of evidence to be relied on. Thus documents obtained later in the course of discovery are not excluded by this rule.

### Facts

The plaintiffs, Radio Works Ltd and TVWorks Ltd, are challenging assessments made by the Commissioner disallowing deductions claimed in relation to optional convertible notes (OCNs) issued by the plaintiffs to other companies in the same group. The Commissioner wishes to obtain general discovery from the plaintiffs and discovery from a non party, MediaWorks NZ Ltd, which is the plaintiffs' parent company. Associate Judge Abbott dismissed applications by the plaintiffs for orders that general discovery not be required and granted the Commissioner's application for particular discovery against MediaWorks NZ Ltd. The plaintiffs and MediaWorks NZ Ltd applied to review the Associate Judge's decision.

### Decision

The plaintiffs' general proposition was that, although general discovery is not precluded in tax cases, it will only be appropriate in rare cases. This is because the purpose and effect of the statutory scheme in the TAA is to ensure that the Commissioner has the power to obtain all relevant documents and information prior to making an assessment. In most cases, therefore, the Commissioner will already have all relevant documents, making it inappropriate to put the taxpayer to the expense of formal discovery.

MediaWorks NZ Ltd argued that the Associate Judge erred by holding that the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G of the TAA did not require the parties to set out all the available documentary evidence in their statements of position but merely precluded them from asserting "wholly new facts" and, as a result, wrongly concluded that the documents sought on discovery fell within the parties' statements of position and were arguably not excluded by section 138G.

Her Honour Justice Courtney reviewed the history of Part IVA, of the TAA, and its connection with the evidence exclusion rule in Part VIIIA. She did not find that there was any presumption against discovery in that analysis:

*   I do not find the materials that Mr McKay relied on helpful in determining the availability of discovery in tax cases. They were not relied on by the Court of Appeal in _BNZ Investments v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] 1 NZLR 598, 619, where the Court accepted that there had been a "sea-change" in tax litigation over the preceding 15-20 years (at \[19\]).

Her Honour noted that disclosure under section 17 compared with discovery had been considered recently by the Court of Appeal in _ANZ National Bank Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 3 NZLR 123 where it was clearly held that the ambit of section 17 and that of discovery are quite different. Section 17 applies to documents directly relevant to an investigation, whereas discovery is based upon far broader principles as enunciated in the _Peruvian Guano_ case (1883) 11 QBD 55 (CA). This is particularly so where the Commissioner seeks information from third parties.

At \[33\] Her Honour summarised her findings on the section 17 point:

*   Three significant points emerge from these cases. First, because the discovery process is wider than the disclosure process under the TAA, discovery could result in the disclosure of documents that would not be required to be disclosed under s 17. Secondly, there is no reason to treat the Commissioner differently from other litigants, including in relation to the discovery process. Thirdly, the Commissioner should not be precluded from discovery because he did not make ongoing attempts to obtain further disclosure under s 17.

Regarding the operation of section 138G, rather than favour an exclusive "all cards on the table" approach, Her Honour preferred an analysis which aligned the scope of 138G with that set out in the section which sets the evidential standard; section 89M(4)(b) and (6)(b) simply requires "an outline of the evidence".

Regarding third party discovery, the plaintiffs contended that discovery was no longer relevant as they no longer intended to rely on the argument which precipitated the application.

*   The concessions made by the plaintiffs may assist the Commissioner in advancing his argument. However, it seems to me artificial to expect the Commissioner (and the expert witnesses on both sides) to adequately address the question of the value of these OCNs without a full understanding of the nature of the related party transactions of which they formed a part.

The essence of the decision is set out at paragraphs \[75\] and \[76\]:

*   \[75\] I have concluded that discovery in tax litigation is not limited to rare cases. The ambit of disclosure under s 17 is narrower than the ambit of discovery under the High Court Rules by reason of the breadth of the Peruvian Guano test. The fact that the Commissioner might, by issuing further notices under s 17, have obtained more documents is no reason to refuse discovery. Nor, in the normal course, should the fact that parties may have expended substantial time and cost complying with s 17 notices preclude discovery being required in later proceedings.  
    \[76\] In relation to the evidence exclusion rule in s 138G, I have concluded that this ought to be read together with s 89M(4)(b) and (6)(b) so that a party is required only to provide an outline of the evidence relied on rather than identifying each piece of evidence. As a result, documents obtained later during the course of discovery are not necessarily excluded by s 138G.

Government agencies are expected to work together and achieve better outcomes for New Zealanders. The Government also expects all New Zealanders to meet their legal obligations. 1.2 A practical way for government agencies to work together to help achieve these high-level objectives is through information sharing of specific information, for specific purposes. Such collaboration also allows for more prudent use of taxpayer funds by agencies. Summary of the proposal 1.3 Both Inland Revenue and the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) hold information that, if provided to the other agency, would help the other agency better discharge their functions and duties. Currently, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Privacy Act 2020 do not allow the sharing of this information between the agencies. 1.4 MBIE has responsibility for a range of services and functions which could be significantly improved through the use of information shared by Inland Revenue which is custodian to a large amount of taxpayer information. 1.5 Inland Revenue currently exchanges information with certain areas of MBIE for different purposes but expanding the range of purposes would be beneficial. In turn, Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system could also benefit by receiving certain information from MBIE. 1.6 More specifically, the Government believes that certain problems reported by both agencies could be alleviated through expanded information sharing. These problems include, but are not limited to, ‘phoenix companies’ 1 , levels of non-compliance, and the inability of the agencies to communicate certain information to New Zealand businesses. These issues are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. 1.7 This discussion document sets out the objectives of a proposed approved information sharing agreement (AISA). It sets out the proposed parameters of the information sharing agreement and explains why government considers that it is needed. Public views are sought on all aspects of implementing this information sharing agreement, including safeguards to protect confidentiality. 1.8 The proposed AISA is expected to deliver the following benefits: • Improving the administration and governance of the tax system, some MBIE administered registers, the criminal proceeds regime, and the insolvency regime. • Enabling and co-operation on compliance and enforcement work, including: 1 This includes where company directors transfer the assets of a company to a new company at under market value, or simply leave the debts of the old company behind, with the intention of defeating the interests of creditors of the old company. October 2024 Page 5 of 35 – ensuring the efficient and effective prevention, detection, investigation, and prosecution of offences under the Crimes Act 1961 and legislation that either agency administers (where either agency has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has occurred, is occurring or will occur) – ensuring that appropriate penalties and administrative sanctions are imposed on individuals and entities under legislation that either agency administers, and – assisting with decision-making and collaboration on strategic approaches to compliance work and to enforcing the obligations of common customers. • Allowing relevant information to be delivered to New Zealand businesses. • Enabling the development of public policy (including potential costings and impact modelling for public policy proposals). Document outline • Chapter 2 outlines the background of the proposal, detailing the current information shares in place, where these are proposed to be expanded, and what business units within Inland Revenue and MBIE provide and receive what information. • Chapter 3 details the information proposed to be shared and the benefits of sharing the information. • Chapter 4 discusses the privacy safeguards that would be in place if the proposed AISA comes into force. • Appendix 1 summarises the options analysis. • Appendix 2 summarises the existing information shares, the proposed information shares, and the purpose for use of information. • Appendix 3 includes a summary of the registers and the information from each register that is proposed to be shared. • Appendix 4 contains the proposed AISA between Inland Revenue and MBIE. Questions for submitters 1.9 While submissions can cover any aspect of this discussion document, we are especially interested in views on: • Do you consider that the issue outlined is of concern? • Do you think that information sharing would address the problem? • Do you support each of the categories of information sharing outlined in Chapter 3? • Are there sufficient safeguards for the protection of people’s information? October 2024 Page 6 of 35 Making a submission 1.10 The Government invites submissions on the proposals in this document, including the specific questions asked and any other issues raised in the document. 1.11 Include in your submission a brief summary of the major points and recommendations you have made. Please indicate if officials from Inland Revenue and MBIE can contact you to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.12 The closing date for submissions is 13 December 2024. 1.13 Submissions can be made by: • emailing: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Information sharing between Inland Revenue and MBIE” in the subject line; or • sending to: Information sharing between Inland Revenue and MBIE C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON 6140 1.14 This consultation process is done under section 150 of the Privacy Act 2020, which requires consultation on any proposed AISA before it can be finalised. 1.15 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982. Please clearly indicate in your submission if any information should be withheld on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason (contact information such as an address, email, and phone number for submissions from individuals will be withheld). Any information withheld will be determined using the Official Information Act 1982. October 2024 Page 7 of 35 Chapter 2 Background 2.1 The Government proposes that Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) enter an approved information sharing agreement (AISA), under the Privacy Act 2020, to share more information effectively and carry out their respective responsibilities. 2.2 The proposed AISA would help with some current issues faced by the agencies. It would consolidate existing memorandums of understanding and incorporate additional information shares, leading to improved administration of the tax system, some MBIE administered registers, the criminal proceeds and insolvency regimes, and more effective compliance and enforcement work. It would benefit New Zealand businesses by enabling the provision of helpful information to support them. The AISA will also help enable the development of public policy. Current issues 2.3 As mentioned in Chapter 1, the underlying issue is that there is information held by Inland Revenue and MBIE which cannot currently be shared with the other agency. If this information was shared with the other agency, it would have the potential to help both agencies better discharge their functions and duties, save on costs, and improve their efficiency. Some of the specific issues where information sharing could help are discussed below. Phoenix companies 2.4 The Government is concerned about poor and illegal business practices by some company directors, often called ‘phoenixing’. This includes where company directors transfer the assets of a company to a new company at under market value, or simply leave the debts of the old company behind, with the intention of defeating the interests of creditors of the old company. These so called ‘phoenix companies’ have a range of negative impacts for New Zealand businesses and consumers. 2.5 Although there is anecdotal evidence of phoenix companies, the true scale of the problem is not known. There is not one fixed definition of ‘phoenixing’ and its wider conception outside of specific provisions in the Companies Act 1993. There is, therefore, little quantitative evidence about it. This also makes it hard to collect data on phoenixing and leads to confusion amongst market participants. The phoenixing provisions in the Companies Act 1993 aim to address the potential harm caused by a new company having a similar name to an old company, which can lead to consumers and others being misled about who they are dealing with. However, there are other types of behaviours that can also be called “phoenixing”, such as when a company sells its assets below value to a new company, or simply walks away from the company leaving the debts behind. 2.6 There is concern this harmful practice continues to occur and that more could be done to prevent it, particularly when the behaviours are repeated. There is no reliable data demonstrating the scale of phoenixing in New Zealand, but whenever this occurs it can cause significant harm to businesses, individuals, and the New Zealand October 2024 Page 8 of 35 economy. Even low levels of this type of harmful activity impacts on the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system. 2.7 The AISA would authorise Inland Revenue to give MBIE information that could help combat phoenixing. Specifically, Inland Revenue will be able to give MBIE information that will enable it to better identify phoenix companies, prohibit a person from acting as a director, and bring prosecutions for offences under the Companies Act 1993 that address phoenixing. 2.8 The AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to access director information on the Companies Register to compare contact details, including phone numbers, email, and IP addresses, of a prohibited director with those of the person in control of the new entity. This will help Inland Revenue identify if a prohibited director is associated with, and controlling, a newly incorporated company. This would help determine whether the matter should be referred to MBIE for enforcement action. Compliance and enforcement 2.9 Barriers to information-sharing also prevent co-operation between the agencies on compliance. Both agencies are responsible for the stewardship of their respective regulatory systems and undertake enforcement action against directors and companies who are non-compliant. There can be overlap between the agencies’ jurisdictions, but due to their inability to communicate with one another regarding enforcement and prosecution, the agencies have sometimes separately investigated or prosecuted the same director. This is time-consuming for both the agencies and the director concerned. 2.10 This inability to share information allows opportunities for non-compliance. Both agencies are responsible for conducting investigations and initiating proceedings to address non-compliance in their respective areas. However, existing information sharing agreements are limited and do not permit such usage. 2.11 For instance, MBIE can prohibit a person from acting as a director when: • the person has been a director of a company which failed as a result of mismanagement, or • MBIE seeks orders to have a person disqualified from acting as a director on various grounds including where they have committed specified offences. 2.12 There are some situations where Inland Revenue can prosecute a director for non- compliance but, due to the current restrictions, cannot share this information with MBIE. Because of this, the Market Integrity Branch within MBIE is sometimes not aware of individuals who should be considered for prohibition. This allows these individuals to continue their activities, undermining the integrity of the tax system. 2.13 There is concern that there are many cases where a director should be prohibited but, due to the current restrictions, the agencies are unable to share information that will help to build cases against these directors. Providing information to New Zealand businesses 2.14 Inland Revenue holds information about New Zealand businesses that currently cannot be shared. This includes information such as contact details, industry segment information, business type and size. The MBIE Business and Consumer October 2024 Page 9 of 35 Branch could use this information to contact businesses directly to provide them with tailored information from across government and the private sector, critical to their success, including compliance requirements and support available. 2.15 The lack of an agreement reduces agencies’ ability to provide targeted services to New Zealand businesses and assist in complying with their obligations. As Inland Revenue cannot currently share this information, these interventions cannot take place, leading to greater costs for both agencies. Businesses undergoing compliance activities would also incur extra costs if dealing with both agencies. 2.16 During COVID-19, there was an exemption made under the Tax Administration Act 1994 2 that allowed Inland Revenue to share some New Zealand business information with MBIE’s Business and Consumer Branch. This information sharing proved beneficial for the Business and Consumer Branch to inform businesses of the support they had available to them during that period. This exemption has now lapsed. Policy development 2.17 Another area where there are perceived benefits from information sharing is in public policy development. The agencies both develop policy that affects businesses operating in New Zealand. The agencies collect data to help inform the development of policy interventions. However, as each agency cannot access information held by the other, their ability to develop targeted policy interventions and accurately gauge the cost of new measures or their impact on business is limited. Options analysis 2.18 The agencies considered five possible options to address issues with their information sharing arrangements: • maintaining the status quo • using the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s powers to collect information • making regulations to permit bulk data collection • amending primary and secondary legislation, and • establishing an AISA. 2.19 Each option was evaluated based on its effectiveness in facilitating existing information sharing between the agencies, as well as its ability to enable further information sharing in accordance with current legislation. A full options analysis can be found in Appendix 1. 2.20 The options analysis determined that an AISA was the best way to enable the agencies to share the information that would help one another carry out their responsibilities. 2.21 The AISA regime in the Privacy Act 2020 was designed as a flexible mechanism to enable the secure sharing of information to better facilitate the provision of public services. 2 COVID-19 sharing provision to support MBIE’s communication with businesses on COVID-related initiatives. October 2024 Page 10 of 35 2.22 An AISA can modify the information privacy principles in the Privacy Act 2020 3 (by Order in Council), enabling the sharing of personal information that would not otherwise be allowed under that Act. The information privacy principles to be modified in the proposed AISA are: • Principle 2 – Source of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 2 for the agencies to collect personal information from each other for the purposes of the AISA. • Principle 10 – Limits on use of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 10 for the agencies to use personal information that they obtain for one purpose for the purposes of the AISA. • Principle 11 – Limits on disclosure of personal information: It will not be a breach of information privacy principle 11 for the agencies to disclose personal information to each other for the purposes of the AISA. 2.23 An AISA gives transparency about the information that may be shared and the purposes of the sharing. It also provides further safeguards, which protect the security of the information shared under the AISA. Such transparency and safeguards are designed to encourage public trust in the information sharing process. 2.24 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) was consulted during the initial AISA drafting process and is pleased to see that the Privacy Commissioner’s recommendations have been adopted with respect to information collected and disclosed for policy development purpose not being able to be used for any other purpose by the parties to the proposed AISA; restrictions on further on-sharing of information; use of anonymised information wherever practicable and taking all reasonable steps to prevent the re-identification of individuals in any research or statistical material published. 2.25 An AISA is agreed between the proposed parties after consultation with the public and further consultation with OPC. Once approved through an Order in Council, the AISA will take effect as secondary legislation. This requires approval from Ministers and Cabinet. 2.26 An AISA can be amended once it comes into force, but if the amendments have any privacy implications, they must go through a robust consultation process (including with OPC) before they can be approved. Amendments require Cabinet to authorise the Governor-General to make an Order in Council approving the amendment to the AISA. 2.27 Information proposed to be shared in this AISA is detailed in Chapter 3, with more detail included in Appendices 2 and 3. Advantages of an AISA 2.28 An AISA can provide the following advantages: • facilitating agency co-operation and efficiency in shared public service delivery while meeting privacy expectations 3 Privacy Act 2020, section 22. October 2024 Page 11 of 35 • legal authority to share where there is a lack of authority or incomplete authority • certainty and assurance about how information will be protected, reported and deleted • accountability and transparency for the public about information sharing arrangements • potential to accommodate multiple parties – either as signatories to the agreement, or through a representative party • flexibility to tailor privacy safeguards in the AISA depending on the privacy risks involved, and • flexibility to make minor changes without further legislative instruments. Proposed parties to the AISA 2.29 The proposed parties to the AISA are Inland Revenue and two branches in MBIE, the Market Integrity Branch (MIB) and the Business and Consumer Branch (BCB) (the parties). Given the size and scope of MBIE, it is appropriate to narrow the application of the AISA to the relevant branches and business units below: • MIB’s relevant business units are: – the Business Registries unit (known as the New Zealand Companies Office), which administers a number of registers – the Criminal Proceeds, Integrity, and Enforcement unit (CPIE), which manages criminal proceeds and undertakes compliance and enforcement functions for the Registrars of the registers administered by the Companies Office and the Official Assignee – the Insolvency and Trustee Service unit (ITS), which administers certain types of bankruptcy and some company liquidations • BCB’s relevant business unit is the Small Business Services unit (known as business.govt.nz), which supports New Zealand businesses. 2.30 If there are any changes to the branches and business units, which undertake the functions listed above, the parties would look to update the names used in the AISA. Current state and limitations 2.31 Inland Revenue and MIB already exchange information through three memorandums of understanding (MOUs). These MOUs allow Inland Revenue and MIB to work together to manage removals from the New Zealand Companies Register and the Limited Partnerships Register, investigate specific offences under the Companies Act 1993, and manage insolvencies. BCB has also previously been able to use information from Inland Revenue, through an MOU, to send newsletters, updates, and other communications to businesses on COVID-19 related initiatives. 2.32 Although there are three MOUs in place to facilitate an exchange, the agencies cannot share additional information beyond the scope of the MOUs as the Tax Administration Act 1994 and Privacy Act 2020 do not allow this. October 2024 Page 12 of 35 2.33 The tax system must keep taxpayers' information confidential to encourage voluntary compliance with tax rules. The Tax Administration Act 1994 requires Inland Revenue staff to keep all sensitive revenue information confidential, including information that is reasonably capable of identifying a person or entity. Inland Revenue can share such information with agencies such as MBIE only where an exception in the Act applies. 2.34 The Privacy Act 2020 ensures responsible information sharing between the agencies. They are typically unable to share much of the personal information they hold about individuals with each other. 2.35 Inland Revenue has information-gathering powers to obtain MBIE-held information using section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, using section 17B can lack transparency and public scrutiny. Inland Revenue takes the view that this power should be used judiciously and that other, more transparent, avenues for obtaining information on an ongoing basis (such as an AISA) should be considered in appropriate cases. 2.36 The agencies have identified that if they could share some additional information, they would be able to better discharge their functions and duties. They have carefully considered what information would be needed and defined the purposes of the sharing. They have also considered what sharing would require the authority of an AISA, as opposed to what can already be shared under the Privacy Act 2020 or the Tax Administration Act 1994. October 2024 Page 13 of 35 Chapter 3 The proposals 3.1 An AISA can effectively address current legal restrictions, as it is one of the few exemptions to the confidentiality obligations in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Additionally, an AISA can modify restrictions in the Privacy Act 2020 that would otherwise prevent information sharing. Moreover, an AISA would enable Inland Revenue and MIB to consolidate their existing information sharing agreements (replacing the three MOUs), enable information sharing with BCB, and include additional provisions for a broader range of purposes under a single agreement. Proposed AISA 3.2 The existing and additional shares under the proposed AISA can be categorised according to the type of information being shared between Inland Revenue (IR), MIB, and BCB. Table 1 summarises each category of proposed information share and the associated parties. Full details of each category can be found in Appendix 2.

Each section includes narrative around the current arrangements, proposed changes, use of information, and related benefits. 3.4 Inland Revenue, MIB, and BCB will consider all feedback and may make changes to the proposed AISA based on this. The parties will then communicate feedback to relevant Ministers when the proposed AISA is put forward for their approval. Cabinet will also need to authorise Ministers to make a recommendation to the Governor- General to make an Order in Council approving the AISA. October 2024 Page 15 of 35 Chapter 3.1: Information sharing between IR and the Companies Office in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 1. Register information Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 2. Removal and restoration information Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 3. Contact details New share IR  MIB 4. Large company information New share IR  MIB 3.5 The Companies Office is a unit within MBIE’s Market Integrity branch (MIB), which is responsible for the administration of a number of public corporate registers. Category 1: Register information (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.6 Inland Revenue regularly uses its information collection powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to obtain information held by the Companies Office on, or in relation to, the Companies Register. Inland Revenue uses this information to assist in the administration of the tax system, including to assist with service delivery and to support its compliance and enforcement functions. For example, Inland Revenue uses the Companies Register information to update its contact details for taxpayers and to identify who owns or controls an entity or to check for associations between individuals and companies. 3.7 The types of information sought by Inland Revenue include both personal and non- personal information. The information is mainly sourced from publicly available parts of the Companies Register, but it also includes other information, such as a director’s date and place of birth, which is held by the Registrar but not available to the public. 3.8 The existing information sharing will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.9 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue would have more effective access to the Companies Office publicly available information on the following registers 4 : • New Zealand Companies Register, established under the Companies Act 1993 • Incorporated Societies Registers, being the register established under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 and the newer register established under the Incorporated Societies Act 2022, and • Incorporated Charitable Trust Boards Register (Charitable Trusts Register), established under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. 4 The register information that can be viewed by the public includes information in data fields and documents, which have been filed for an entity. Under the proposed ASIA, Inland Revenue would only receive the information in data fields, meaning they would not receive copies of documents filed. October 2024 Page 16 of 35 3.10 The Companies Office would also give Inland Revenue certain information held by the Registrars that is relevant to these registers, but which is not publicly available. 3.11 Details of the types of information to be shared in respect of each register is set out in Appendix 3. The types of information are split into those that are publicly available on the registers, and those that are not publicly available. 3.12 Inland Revenue will use the information from the Companies Office to: • verify and update the contact details it holds for taxpayers and other parties • assist with service delivery and the provision of services to taxpayers • help businesses to comply with their tax obligations • support Inland Revenue’s compliance and enforcement functions, including prevention, detection and enforcing offences under any legislation it administers (currently or in the future) and other non-compliance with tax obligations, and • assist in tax policy development and assessing the impact of tax policy products. 3.13 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.14 The registers held by the Companies Office are the legislatively designated sources of information for entities such as companies, charitable trust boards, and incorporated societies. They contain information relating to the ownership and control of entities in New Zealand. 3.15 The registers are comprehensive sources of information, populated by information supplied by people wanting to incorporate an entity, register information about an entity, or to otherwise gain or maintain registration status. Other information is also collected by the Companies Office to assist with the administration of the registers (such as contact email addresses). 3.16 The three registers proposed to be included are those with details of entities and individuals most likely to have distinct tax and reporting obligations. 3.17 As of 31 March 2024, there were 726,827 companies registered on the Companies Register, and there were more than 1,230,371 searches of the register during March 2024 alone. These figures evidence the prevalence of companies as the most used corporate structure for businesses in New Zealand and the value of the information on the Companies Register to Inland Revenue. 3.18 Specific registers, such as the Charitable Trusts Register, provide information that Inland Revenue can use to identify non-for-profit entities misusing corporate structures to minimise tax obligations. When used together, information from across the registers is valuable in providing a complete picture of a taxpayer and their interests. Information on the Incorporated Trust Boards Register could assist in the unmasking of non-compliant activity associated with trusts. 3.19 As the three registers do not include IRD numbers, Inland Revenue requires access to certain personal information to accurately identify entities and individuals. For instance, the Companies Office would provide company directors’ names, dates of October 2024 Page 17 of 35 birth, and addresses. Inland Revenue needs this information to accurately link register information to its taxpayer information. 3.20 To help Inland Revenue in linking register information to taxpayer information, the Companies Office will also provide presenter details. A presenter is any person who files a document or information for registration, and presenter details can include name, IP address and email address. Presenter details would be especially useful in verifying the origin of information received from taxpayers. 3.21 Although the three registers are available to the public, and can be searched by anyone, they are built for one-off public enquiry and are built with search criteria that is limited. It is not possible to obtain a full copy of a register through a standard search, to return compilations of register information, or to return bulk register information. The registers are not built for use by government agencies, such as Inland Revenue, to search at scale or to search across registers. 3.22 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue greater access to data to help it carry out compliance and enforcement work. This could include the ability to search across the registers, and in bulk, or to merge register information with information from a variety of sources to create information about business networks. 3.23 Access to the register information will help Inland Revenue to accurately identify which people control which entities (for example, by checking the IP address), giving the agency greater clarity of overall business compliance in New Zealand. This knowledge will better enable Inland Revenue to enforce compliance with tax requirements, which impacts tax revenue and provides an unfair advantage to non- compliant businesses. Minimising this unfair advantage improves the New Zealand business environment. 3.24 The proposed AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to use presenter details and match the IP address of a director filing information with the Companies Office with potentially false and misleading tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. This information can be useful to inform the prosecution of a person filing incorrect tax returns or avoiding paying tax. 3.25 Information from the registers would also be used to assist the development of future policy. The registers contain a wealth of information submitted by the entities themselves, which would be of great assistance in developing and assessing the impact of policy products. Category 2: Removal and restoration information (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.26 MIB’s Companies Office and Inland Revenue have an existing information sharing arrangement that supports the processes under the Companies Act 1993 and the Limited Partnership Act 2008 to remove entities from the Companies Register and the Limited Partnerships Register. 3.27 The existing information sharing arrangement ensures that Inland Revenue is aware of which companies and limited partnerships are proposed to be removed from the Registers. Inland Revenue would be able to object to a removal where there are grounds to do so, for instance, if tax is still owed, or there is evidence the company is still trading. October 2024 Page 18 of 35 3.28 Under the existing information sharing arrangement, the Companies Office also gives Inland Revenue a list of all current objections Inland Revenue has lodged to the removal of an entity from the relevant registers. This acts as a checkpoint between agencies so Inland Revenue can track its objections and withdraw any that are no longer relevant, enabling removal of entities from the registers at the appropriate time. 3.29 The current information sharing arrangement helps ensure that entities are not wrongfully removed from the register and that objections to removals are withdrawn in a timely manner. 3.30 The Companies Office also gives Inland Revenue a list of companies and limited partnerships that have been removed or restored to the registers, enabling Inland Revenue to update its records. 3.31 The existing information sharing arrangement concerning company and limited partnership removals will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.32 The proposed AISA would allow the Companies Office to give Inland Revenue lists of entities: • proposed to be removed from, or restored to, the registers • for which Inland Revenue has an existing objection, and • that have been removed from, or restored to, the registers. 3.33 Inland Revenue would use this information to lodge and monitor objections, and to update its records on companies and limited partnerships. 3.34 The proposed AISA would also allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office information about an entity: • that is relevant to Inland Revenue’s objection to its removal or restoration, and • where Inland Revenue considers there may be grounds for the Registrar to initiate removal from, or restoration to, the register. 3.35 The Companies Office would use this information to support the statutory processes for restoring and removing companies and limited partnerships to the registers, including identifying entities for which there are grounds to remove or restore. 3.36 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.37 This category of information sharing will help to ensure that companies and limited partnerships are appropriately removed from, retained on, or restored to, the registers. This in turn, assists in maintaining the integrity of these registers. Category 3: Contact details (new share) Existing information sharing 3.38 No information is currently shared for this category. October 2024 Page 19 of 35 Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.39 The register information that the Companies Office is proposing to share with Inland Revenue under Category 1, includes contact details for entities and individuals. 3.40 If Inland Revenue considers that any contact details may be incorrect, the proposed AISA will allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office the correct contact details according to their records. Inland Revenue will also give the reasons why it considers MIB’s contact details may be incorrect. 3.41 The Companies Office would use the information it receives from Inland Revenue to verify or correct the contact details on the registers. 3.42 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.43 Sharing this information would improve the integrity of contact details held on, or in relation to the Companies Register, the Incorporated Societies Registers and the Register of Incorporated Charitable Trusts Boards. This in turn should improve customers’ experience with the parties. Category 4: Large company information (new share) Existing information sharing 3.44 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.45 “Large companies” are companies that meet certain asset and revenue thresholds under section 198 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 45 of the Financial Reporting Act 2013. Large companies must file audited financial statements under the Companies Act 1993, which are then made available on the Companies Register. 3.46 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to give the Companies Office information that will help it identify which companies may qualify as “large companies” under the Companies Act 1993. The information Inland Revenue would provide will include information about the value of companies’ assets and annual revenue. 3.47 The Companies Office would use information provided by Inland Revenue to determine which companies are “large companies” and check whether they have been complying with their financial reporting obligations under the Companies Act. If necessary, when filings have not occurred, the information may also be used to take appropriate compliance and enforcement action against the company concerned. 3.48 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.49 It is important that large companies comply with their financial reporting obligations. Audited financial statements provide persons interested in the performance of a large company, such as lenders or investors, with reliable and transparent financial information. October 2024 Page 20 of 35 3.50 The Companies Office is tasked with enforcing the financial reporting obligations of large companies. However, it does not hold information about every company’s asset and revenue levels. This means it is often difficult for the Companies Office to identify large companies for the purposes of the Companies Act 1993. 3.51 Inland Revenue, however, does hold the type of information needed to identify large companies. The proposed AISA would give Inland Revenue the ability to share this type of information with the Companies Office to enable better enforcement of financial reporting obligations. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed four categories of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 21 of 35 Chapter 3.2: Information sharing between IR and CPIE in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 5. Information relevant to offences and the imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 6. Failed entity information New share IR  MIB 7. Information concerning GST tax status New share IR  MIB 3.52 MIB’s Criminal Proceeds, Integrity, and Enforcement unit (CPIE) is the enforcement arm for the Companies Office and the Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITS). The unit is responsible for compliance and enforcement work under the Companies Act 1993, the Insolvency Act 2006, and other relevant legislation. CPIE also has responsibilities under the Criminal (Proceeds) Recovery Act 2009. Category 5: Information relevant to offences and the imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.53 CPIE and Inland Revenue have an existing information sharing agreement that allows: • CPIE to request information from Inland Revenue where it suspects certain serious offences have been, are being, or will be committed under the Companies Act 1993, and • Inland Revenue to proactively provide CPIE with information where it suspects those same offences have been, are being, or will be committed. 3.54 This current sharing applies to offences under sections 138A(1), 377, 382(4), 383(6), 385(9), 385AA(9) and 386A(2) of the Companies Act 1993. These are serious offences punishable by up to five years imprisonment. 3.55 This information sharing is authorised by an exception in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3.56 The existing information sharing will be incorporated into the proposed AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.57 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue and CPIE will be able to share with one another: • information relevant to the enforcement of any offences under the Crimes Act 1961 and any legislation that warrants imposition of administrative sanctions or penalties that Inland Revenue or CPIE administer (not just serious offences punishable by up to five years imprisonment), including insolvency and tax- related offences October 2024 Page 22 of 35 • information relevant to the imposition of administrative sanctions and penalties (such as prohibition from being a director) under legislation that Inland Revenue or CPIE administer, and • information about each party’s compliance and enforcement approach and activities, including: – the party’s current priorities for compliance and enforcement – the party’s resources dedicated or available to compliance and enforcement matters – any policies and guidelines relevant to compliance and enforcement – current enforcement and compliance activities, and – details of compliance or enforcement activities against an entity or individual where they know or reasonably suspect the other may also be carrying out compliance or enforcement activity. 3.58 Inland Revenue and CPIE may each use the information they receive from the other to: • prevent, detect, investigate, and provide evidence of offences or of breaches giving rise to administrative sanctions or penalties that may require compliance or enforcement action by that party • prosecute or impose administrative sanctions or penalties • help decision-making on the party’s approach and strategy to compliance and enforcement, and • collaborate with the other party on compliance and enforcement actions such as co-ordinating prosecutions or bringing joint prosecutions. 3.59 Information shared under this category could be used to prosecute an individual or entity. Given the seriousness of such a consequence, the proposed AISA imposes a threshold when either party wants to share information that it thinks the other party may use for the purpose of prosecuting an offence. In that situation, a party may share the information only if it: • has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed, and • believes the information is relevant to the other party being able to detect, investigate, or prosecute that offence. 3.60 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.61 Inland Revenue and CPIE both hold information that is relevant to each other’s enforcement and compliance functions. However, Inland Revenue can currently only share limited Companies Act offence-related information with CPIE. In turn, CPIE can generally only share such information with Inland Revenue where permitted under the Privacy Act 2020. 3.62 The proposed AISA would enable the parties to exchange information about a broader range of behaviour, misconduct, and offending, better enabling each party October 2024 Page 23 of 35 to identify more situations warranting enforcement or compliance action and to put forward more robust prosecutions. 3.63 For example, where a person has been a director in multiple company failures, or a single failed company with a substantial tax debt, Inland Revenue is likely to hold relevant information (such as about tax debt), which it can helpfully share with CPIE, enabling it to prohibit that person from being a director or managing a company under the Companies Act 1993. 3.64 The proposed AISA would also benefit Inland Revenue by allowing it to use presenter details and match the IP address of a director filing information with the Companies Office with potentially false and misleading tax returns filed with Inland Revenue. This information can be useful to inform the prosecution of a person filing incorrect tax returns or avoiding paying tax. 3.65 Inland Revenue administers legislation that is designed to uphold the integrity of the tax system by imposing penalties on individuals and entities that incur but do not discharge the debts they owe. Inland Revenue is aware of cases where entities are being used as vehicles for non-compliant tax activities. Individuals who use the protections of limited liability to incur debts to other businesses and the tax system, and who avoid discharging them, place the integrity of the tax system at risk. It also gives non-compliant businesses a competitive advantage over compliant ones. 3.66 In these situations, Inland Revenue undertakes investigations and enforcement to minimise future tax risk and demonstrate that it will act to protect the integrity of the tax system. Although Inland Revenue has limited ability to prevent the repetition of this behaviour and the risks it poses to other businesses, creditors, and the tax system, CPIE may be able to prohibit an individual from being a manager or director of a company. 3.67 CPIE administers legislation that is designed to uphold the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system, for example, by preventing financial harm due to the misuse of incorporation and limited liability. Entities that are in a ‘better’ financial position by not discharging their debts place compliant entities at a disadvantage. This can significantly damage the financial lives of individuals who invest or trade with such entities or are employed by them. 3.68 While there can be an overlap between their jurisdictions, both Inland Revenue and CPIE are currently limited in what offence and compliance-related information they can share with one another. Inland Revenue and CPIE are not always aware of entities and individuals who should be considered for compliance or enforcement action under legislation they administer. This means some people may get away with non- compliance on occasion, undermining the integrity of the tax system and the corporate governance regulatory system. 3.69 For example, the AISA will allow Inland Revenue to share information with CPIE that is relevant to CPIE’s consideration of whether a director of a failed company has breached the phoenix company provisions in section 386A of the Companies Act 1993 or whether an exception to the general offence provisions applies. In general terms, section 386A prohibits directors of failed companies from being a director of, or being involved in, the formation or management of a phoenix company with the same or a similar name as the failed company in specified periods. The legislation October 2024 Page 24 of 35 provides for certain exceptions, including where the phoenix company has been known by that name and has not been dormant for specified periods. Under the ASIA, Inland Revenue would be able to provide CPIE with information such as trading and accounting records for an entity, which would evidence whether it had been dormant. 3.70 Current limitations to information sharing also impede Inland Revenue and CPIE’s ability to collaborate and co-operate on compliance and enforcement activities, such as co-ordinating prosecutions or bringing joint prosecutions. On occasion, Inland Revenue and CPIE have separately investigated or prosecuted the same director for the same corporate mismanagement, albeit in relation to different offences. 3.71 Establishing a closer working relationship through the AISA will help Inland Revenue and CPIE avoid disconnected proceedings against the same person or entity. This will result in improved public services through more efficient use of expertise and resources. This in turn will help uphold the integrity of the corporate governance regulatory system and the tax system. Category 6: Failed entity information (new share) Existing information sharing 3.72 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.73 The proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to give CPIE information about any company or limited partnership that Inland Revenue reasonably suspects may be a failed entity. A failed entity is a company that meets any of the criteria in section 385(1) of the Companies Act 1993 or a limited partnership that meets any of the criteria under section 103D(1) of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. These criteria include companies and limited partnerships that are insolvent and have been put into some form of administration, such as liquidation or voluntary administration. 3.74 CPIE would use the information to support the exercise of the Registrars’ powers under: • section 385 of the Companies Act 1993, which allows the Registrar to prohibit a person from being a director of a company or from being involved in the management of a company, and • section 103D of the Limited Partnership Act 2008, which allows the Registrar to prohibit a person from being a general partner of a limited partnership or from being involved in the management of a limited partnership. 3.75 These powers of prohibition can be used by the Registrar only where there is evidence that mismanagement was wholly or partly responsible for the failure of a company or limited partnership. 3.76 Mismanagement includes failures to pay taxes or failures to keep records that correctly record the transactions of a company or limited partnership. In most cases where a power of prohibition has been exercised, mismanaged entities have failed to account for taxes. 3.77 Inland Revenue holds information that is directly relevant to the exercise of the Registrar’s powers of prohibition. This includes information about a company or October 2024 Page 25 of 35 limited partnership’s tax affairs and finances, and other information that shows the mismanagement of failed entities. 3.78 CPIE would use information from Inland Revenue to investigate failed entities and persons involved in their management (including their directors and general partners). This information could be used as evidence of mismanagement and to support the Registrar’s prohibition powers. 3.79 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.80 This new information share would better support the Registrar’s use of the prohibition powers in section 385 of the Companies Act 1993 and section 103D of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. Use of these powers helps in upholding the public’s confidence in the integrity of New Zealand’s corporate system, given prohibition is aimed at removing persons from office who are not fit to be a director or general partner. The regime serves to protect the public from unfit or unscrupulous directors, deterring others, and setting appropriate standards of behaviour. 3.81 This share would also assist in upholding the integrity of the tax system, as it would assist in prohibiting those responsible for trading to the detriment of the Crown from obtaining an unfair trading advantage. Category 7: Information concerning GST tax status (new share) Existing information sharing 3.82 No information is currently shared for this category. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.83 Under the proposed AISA, Inland Revenue would be able to share information with CPIE about whether an entity or individual is required to account for GST for the sale of property that is subject to an order of sale under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 that is to be discharged by the Official Assignee. 3.84 CPIE would use the information it receives from Inland Revenue to assist in accounting for GST in the sale of the entity’s or individual’s property. 3.85 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.86 This information share will help CPIE to comply with applicable GST obligations when selling property that has been forfeited. This reduces the risk of MBIE being liable for unpaid GST on any such sale. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed three categories of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 26 of 35 Chapter 3.3: Information sharing between IR and ITS in MBIE’s MIB Category of information shared Description Information flow 8. Information relevant to bankrupts and company liquidations Expansion of existing share IR  MIB 3.87 The Insolvency and Trustee Service (ITS) is a unit in MIB. ITS is responsible for administering personal bankruptcy procedures and company liquidations where the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. Category 8: Information relevant to bankrupts and company liquidations (expansion of existing share) Existing information sharing 3.88 ITS and Inland Revenue have an existing MOU that assists them to effectively discharge their respective responsibilities and statutory functions. The current information sharing includes: • ITS provides Inland Revenue with lists of persons adjudicated bankrupt, those admitted to the no asset procedure or who have entered a debt repayment order, and those who are undischarged or whose bankruptcy has been annulled. It also gives Inland Revenue lists of companies for which the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. ITS also provides Inland Revenue with a copy of the sealed order for consent for a bankrupt regarding their employment status. • Inland Revenue provides ITS with information about the GST status of bankrupt taxpayers, advice about the revenue content of tax refunds, and specific information relating to changes in bankrupts’ employment status and their KiwiSaver funds as requested by the Official Assignee. 3.89 All existing information sharing between Inland Revenue and ITS relating to insolvency matters will be captured in the AISA. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.90 The proposed AISA will enable ITS to continue to provide the same information it currently does to Inland Revenue, such as lists of adjudicated bankrupts. Inland Revenue will use this information to maintain its records, undertake operational activities, and to discharge its statutory responsibilities. 3.91 The proposed AISA will also allow Inland Revenue to give ITS any information that may be relevant to the Official Assignee’s administration of a bankruptcy, or a company liquidation being administered by the Official Assignee. Inland Revenue will also be able to share information that is relevant to the Official Assignee’s statutory functions and duties in relation to bankruptcies or liquidations. The type of information that Inland Revenue might give ITS includes: • information about a third party that is or may be relevant to the Official Assignee’s administration of a bankruptcy or liquidation October 2024 Page 27 of 35 • any information regarding tax debts or relevant financial information held in relation to an individual or entity • any known bank account details for an individual or entity, and • information about any civil action that Inland Revenue has previously taken against an individual or entity. 3.92 ITS will use this information to support the Official Assignee’s administration of bankruptcy estates and company liquidations, and for compliance and enforcement under the Insolvency Act 2006 and the Companies Act 1993. 3.93 Additionally, the proposed AISA would allow Inland Revenue to share information when a person who is currently bankrupt has died. ITS will use this information to help the Official Assignee discharge the person from their bankruptcy where they have not filed a statement of affairs. 3.94 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.95 For the purposes of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Official Assignee is classed as: • the personal legal representative of a bankrupt taxpayer, and • the agent of a company where that company has been put into liquidation, and the Official Assignee has been appointed as liquidator. 3.96 This means that Inland Revenue is permitted to disclose to the Official Assignee information about a bankrupt taxpayer or a company for which the Official Assignee is the liquidator. 3.97 However, the applicable exceptions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 do not permit Inland Revenue to disclose information to the Official Assignee that is not directly about the bankrupt taxpayer or company in liquidation, even though it may indirectly impact their affairs. For instance, Inland Revenue is unable to give the Official Assignee information about a third party’s dealings with a bankrupt that might affect that bankrupt’s insolvency compliance (for example, if Inland Revenue held information about a third party purchasing an asset from a bankrupt taxpayer). This sort of information can be helpful to the Official Assignee. 3.98 Section 171 of the Insolvency Act 2006 empowers the Official Assignee to obtain documents by notice in writing from any person relating to the property, conduct or dealings of a bankrupt. This power is in addition to the Official Assignee’s power to summons people to be examined or produce documents in person and allows the Official Assignee to gather information on bankrupt persons. Section 261 of the Companies Act 1993 also provides the Official Assignee with a similar power in relation to companies in liquidation. 3.99 However, the Official Assignee’s information gathering powers do not overcome the limits on disclosure in the Tax Administration Act 1994. As a result, the Official Assignee cannot use these powers to get information from Inland Revenue that it may want to better carry out its responsibilities. October 2024 Page 28 of 35 3.100 The proposed AISA would ultimately clarify and consolidate the basis on which information can be shared between Inland Revenue and the Official Assignee. It would enable the proactive sharing of relevant information about third parties that might affect insolvency compliance. An AISA would also enable the improved administration of the personal and corporate insolvency regimes. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed category of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 29 of 35 Chapter 3.4: Information sharing between IR and business.govt.nz in MBIE’s BCB Category of information shared Description Information flow 9. Entity information enabling direct communication with New Zealand businesses Expansion of previous share IR  BCB 3.101 business.govt.nz is part of the Small Business unit within MBIE’s Business and Consumer branch (BCB). It supports New Zealand businesses by providing expert guidance and tools. Category 9: Entity information enabling direct communication with New Zealand businesses (expansion of previous share) Previous information sharing 3.102 Under COVID-19 legislation, clause 23B was inserted into Schedule 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which allowed information to be shared between Inland Revenue and other agencies where needed to support the pandemic response. This power was introduced temporarily to deliver COVID-19 support to businesses. 3.103 In March 2020, as part of this all-of-government response, Inland Revenue and MBIE’s BCB entered an MOU enabling the sharing of information for the purpose of contacting businesses impacted by COVID-19. The information shared included: • full legal name and trading name (if applicable) • business contact details, physical address, email address or other addresses • New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) • an ‘in business’ indicator • business type (for example, ANZSIC code 5 ) • number of employees, and • organisation type indicator (for example, self-employed, small/medium enterprise, large enterprise). 3.104 The aim of sharing this information was to enable business.govt.nz to reach businesses with tailored COVID-19 related information and support. The sharing of information helped BCB reach about 500,000 more businesses who were not subscribed to the business.govt.nz newsletter, enabling them to better access support, information, and updates from government as it related to COVID-19. The newsletters also provided support and recovery information, and often included updates from other government agencies. These newsletters were well received, with an average engagement rate consistently above 50%. Recipients were able to easily unsubscribe at any time. 5 ANZIC is the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification. October 2024 Page 30 of 35 3.105 The MOU between Inland Revenue and BCB that enabled this share was underpinned by COVID-19 legislation. However, in a post-COVID-19 context, this MOU and entity information shares between Inland Revenue and business.govt.nz has ended. Proposed new information sharing under the AISA 3.106 It is proposed that Inland Revenue will give business.govt.nz the information listed above for every entity and individual in business in New Zealand, excluding the NZBN number. 3.107 Additionally, it is proposed that Inland Revenue will give business.govt.nz the following information: • business age • location of business (by region) • segment (i.e. micro-business, families, individuals, significant enterprises, small-medium) • revenue (by bands), and • financial ratios (e.g. from IR10 tax return form). 3.108 business.govt.nz will use this information to send direct communications to New Zealand businesses, and to provide tailored support, guidance, and advice from across government and the private sector critical to their success, including compliance requirements and support available. 3.109 Full details of this information share can be found in Appendix 2. Reasons for the proposed sharing 3.110 This share under the AISA would ensure business.govt.nz can contact all relevant businesses on an on-going basis, that is, not just in a COVID-19 context. The ongoing communications from business.govt.nz would be targeted to the relevant businesses’ circumstances, enabling businesses to better comply with their obligations and to access the support available to them. 3.111 Research suggests that businesses are likely to be more compliant, successful, and resilient if they have access to the right advice at the right time. 6 Most business owners want to comply with rules and make their businesses a success. However, many struggle to afford expert advice for all issues. Even if this advice is freely available, businesses may not be aware of where to look, what their obligations are, how to act on them, or what they should trust. 3.112 business.govt.nz was established to bring together information in one place to support small businesses. The business.govt.nz newsletter alerts businesses to law changes, new support and issues they may not know about. Each year more and more small businesses use business.govt.nz to find out about law changes and support available for them. 3.113 There is a significant benefit and public interest in businesses receiving information that assists them to comply with their legal obligations and succeed. The best way 6 Inland Revenue’s Young Business Journeys research and business.govt.nz’s New Business Journeys research (which followed on from the Young Business Journeys research). October 2024 Page 31 of 35 business.govt.nz can help businesses is by communicating directly with them, and tailoring information to their needs as much as possible. To do this business.govt.nz needs to be able to reach all businesses and having access to their contact information can assist this process. Having access to information about the nature of the business (e.g. size and type) better helps business.govt.nz to target information to those who will find it most useful. Question for submitters Do you support the proposed category of information sharing outlined in this section? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 32 of 35 Chapter 3.5: Information sharing between IR and MBIE’s MIB and BCB Information shared Description Information flow Any of the information that can be shared under Categories 1 to 9 for the development of public policy. New share IR  BCB and MIB 3.114 This is not an explicit category of information share in the proposed AISA. It is open to either Inland Revenue or either of MBIE’s branches (MIB or BCB) to ask one another for any of the information that can already be shared under any of Categories 1 to 9 if they want to use it to help develop public policy. The information shared may be used for potential costings and impact modelling for public policy proposals. 3.115 Where information is shared for the purpose of helping develop public policy, the party giving the information must anonymise the information if practicable. The party receiving it can only use it for public policy purposes and must not subsequently publish or disclose it in a way that any individual or entity can be reasonably identified. Question for submitters Do you support the proposal to exchange information for the purpose of public policy development? Please explain your answer. October 2024 Page 33 of 35 Chapter 4 Privacy safeguards 4.1 Inland Revenue, MIB, and BCB take the protection of New Zealanders’ information seriously. The proposed AISA would include a range of safeguards to minimise any risks of loss, misuse, or improper disclosure of the information that is shared. 4.2 Individuals would continue to have: • the right to seek access to, and correction of, their personal information under the Privacy Act 2020, and • the ability to use the agencies’ internal complaint procedures if they have concerns about how their information has been treated. 4.3 If any serious privacy breach were to occur, the party involved would need to notify the Privacy Commissioner and the affected individuals. The steps that would need to be taken to minimise and mitigate any risk to those individuals from a serious privacy breach include: • designated senior personnel in the party would meet to assess the issue and manage the response • information-sharing would be immediately suspended if there were any risk of on-going breaches, and • the Office of the Privacy Commissioner would be notified if it is a notifiable privacy breach under Part 6 of the Privacy Act 2020. Operational protocols to be developed 4.4 The parties would agree operational protocols under the proposed AISA before sharing any information. The operational protocols will provide details on the methods of information sharing, including: • security arrangements and technical standards for the transfer of information • procedures to verify an individual or entity’s identity, to identify any discrepancies in the information that is held by each party, and how to update that individual or entity’s record • provisions that specify how frequently the information is to be shared and in what format • requirements for the retention and disposal of information shared, and • the appointment and training of authorised staff, so that they can share information appropriately and according to the AISA. Limits on use and disclosure of information shared 4.5 The sharing of information would be permitted only for the purposes set out in the proposed AISA. Each party’s use of the information it receives under the AISA would be limited to the particular purposes for that category of information (see the purposes set out in Appendix 2). October 2024 Page 34 of 35 4.6 The parties will not be able to disclose the information shared under the AISA to any third party, unless the disclosure was: • necessary or incidental to the party’s permitted use of the information • to other parts of MBIE where that is reasonably necessary for a lawful business purpose connected to the purposes of the AISA • to the individual or entity that is the subject of the information, or their agents or advisors, or • permitted or required by law. 4.7 Staff who knowingly disclose Inland Revenue information outside what is permitted by the proposed AISA would face potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer confidentiality under section 143C or 143D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. On conviction, they could be liable to a term of imprisonment of up to six months and a fine not exceeding $15,000. 4.8 Staff who knowingly disclosed information outside of what is permitted by the proposed AISA would also be in breach of the Public Service Code of Conduct. 7 Secure transfer of information 4.9 The parties propose to transfer the information that is shared under the AISA using a secure transmission method that complies with government security standards, such as SEEMail 8 , Secure File Transfer Protocol, or B2B framework. The transmission method may change over time as new and improved technology becomes available. Information would be shared only by authorised staff. Pre-requisites to apply before information is shared that may lead to prosecution 4.10 Some of the information shared under the AISA could potentially be used by Inland Revenue and MIB to prosecute an individual or entity for an offence under legislation that the party administers. This would be a potentially serious consequence for the affected individual or entity. 4.11 The proposed AISA, therefore, imposes a threshold when either party wants to share information that it thinks the other party may use for the purpose of prosecuting an offence. In that situation, the party may share the information only if it: • has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed, and • believes the information is relevant to the other party being able to detect, investigate, or prosecute that offence. Written notice to be given to individuals before adverse action is taken 4.12 Section 152 of the Privacy Act 2020 requires agencies that are party to an AISA to provide written notice to individuals before any adverse action is taken against them based on personal information shared under that AISA. The type of things that might 7 The Standards of Integrity and Conduct, as defined in the Public Service Act 2020, s17(2) 8 https://www.ict.govt.nz/services/show/SEEMail October 2024 Page 35 of 35 constitute an adverse action include investigating a breach of legislation, bringing a prosecution, or imposing an administrative sanction or penalty. 4.13 The written notice must include details of the proposed adverse action, and the personal information on which the action is based. It must also give the individual 10 working days to dispute the correctness of that information. 4.14 Section 153 of the Privacy Act 2020 allows an AISA to provide that a party may dispense with this written notice requirement. The proposed AISA allows a party to dispense with the notice only where the sharing of personal information gives them reasonable grounds to suspect that: • either: – an offence has been, is being, or is likely to be committed under legislation that the party administers; or – a person has engaged, is engaging, or will engage in activity that means they may be subject to an administrative sanction or may warrant the imposition of a penalty under legislation that the party administers – the personal information is relevant to the party’s decision-making on preventative, investigative or enforcement interventions related to that offence, administrative sanction, or penalty, and – advance notification by the party to the subject of the adverse action would be likely to defeat the purpose of the intervention. 4.15 Other than in these circumstances, Inland Revenue and MIB will be required to give the necessary written notice to the affected individual before taking an adverse action. 4.16 For example, Inland Revenue or MIB might dispense with giving written notice of an adverse action if to do so would likely interfere with an investigation of a suspected offence. Ongoing assessment of the AISA 4.17 The agencies will assess the operation of the AISA annually to check it is operating as intended, and to check that the safeguards remain sufficient to protect the privacy of individuals. This assessment may involve a full audit or some other form of assessment. 4.18 The assessment may include the completion of the security Certification and Accreditation process. 4.19 The results of the assessment will inform Inland Revenue’s report (as lead agency for the AISA) on the operation of the AISA in its annual report. Question for submitters Would there be sufficient safeguards for the protection of people’s information under the proposal? Is there anything else that should be considered?

Dismissal of application to dispense with security for costs
============================================================

2015 case note - application for an order dispensing with, or postponing payment of security for costs - impecuniosity, vexatious appeal.

Case

Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, r 20.13

### Summary

The High Court dismissed Mr Musuku’s application for an order dispensing with, or postponing payment of, security for costs in accordance with High Court Rules, r 20.13.

### Facts

Mr Musuku is appealing the Taxation Review Authority’s (“the Authority”) decision to dismiss his challenge to the Commissioner’s income tax assessment for 2006. In relation to the appeal, Mr Musuku made an application for an order dispensing with, or postponing payment of, security for costs relying on High Court Rules, r 20.13.

### Decision

Muir J recognised the Supreme Court decision _Reekie v Attorney-General_ \[2014\] NZSC 63, \[2014\] 1 NZLR 737 (_Reekie_) as the leading authority on security for costs. Although _Reekie_ concerned the application of the Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005, his Honour referenced previous authorities confirming the application of the same principles to matters governed by r 20.13 (_Jones v Waitemata District Health Board_ \[2014\] NZHC 3370; _Skagen v Wellington Standards Committee of the New Zealand Law Society_ \[2015\] NZHC 675).

Muir J summarised the following principles from _Reekie_:

1.  Impecuniosity does not, in itself, warrant an order dispensing with security.
2.  Security for costs should only be dispensed with if it is right to require the respondent to defend the judgment under challenge without the usual protection as to costs provided by security.
3.  As to whether it is right to require security for costs to be dispensed with, discretion should be exercised so as to:
    1.  preserve access to the Court by an impecunious appellant in the case of an appeal which a solvent appellant would reasonably wish to prosecute; and
    2.  prevent the use of impecuniosity to secure the advantage of being able to prosecute an appeal which would not be sensibly pursued by a solvent litigant.
4.  Where an impecunious appellant has secured representation from non-legal aid counsel, any dispensation from security for costs will be based on whether the case is of the kind which would be appropriate for a grant of legal aid.
5.  Protecting respondents from vexatious appeals is a legitimate purpose of the security for costs regime, and an appeal or its conduct may be considered vexatious for such purposes even though it does raise some points which are arguable.
6.  Cost and benefit are not to be assessed in purely financial terms.
7.  In terms of establishing impecuniosity, an appellant without liquid assets may be required to borrow money to provide security, or it may be appropriate to investigate whether another party (for example, a relative or family trust) might provide the necessary funding.

Muir J regarded the absence of direct evidence of Mr Musuku’s impecuniosity as decisive. His Honour further held, consistent with _Reekie,_ that if impecuniosity had been demonstrated it would not of itself warrant an order dispensing with security.

On a preliminary basis, Muir J found that Mr Musuku’s prospects of success on appeal were not encouraging.

The first ground of appeal is that the Commissioner’s assessment did not represent an honest appraisal and a genuine exercise of judgement. His Honour referred to the Authority’s finding that there was no merit in this argument.

The second ground of appeal is that the Commissioner’s assessment is incorrect. Muir J referred to the Authority’s finding that Mr Musuku’s arguments were “completely without merit”. His Honour then referred to Mr Musuku’s argument that all payments made to him were in his capacity as creditor. In response, Muir J stated: “\[t\]hat seems to me a difficult argument on the facts as found by Judge Sinclair and having regard to the absence of evidence supporting the proposition”.

The third ground of appeal is that sufficient evidence was available as to the amount by which the Commissioner’s assessment is incorrect. In response, Muir J referred to the finding of the Authority that there was little benefit from the evidence adduced on Mr Musuku’s behalf, and stated that on a provisional basis the High Court was likely to come to a similar conclusion.

His Honour also found that, had it been necessary, Mr Musuku’s history of pursuing unsuccessful litigation and failing to meet costs awards would have been relevant to his exercise of judgment under High Court Rules, r 20.13.

In conclusion, Muir J held that Mr Musuku’s appeal should not proceed without security. His Honour considered that the Commissioner would otherwise be exposed to an appeal in respect of which there are only slight prospects of success and with little prospect of the Commissioner otherwise recovering costs.

Disposal deemed at market value
===============================

2009 case note - plaintiff claimed as deduction the purchase price of shares; CIR disallowed deduction and deemed disposal of shares to be at market value.

Case

Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Limited v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The plaintiff acquired 100% of the shares in a company and amalgamated that company with three others into one unit. As a result of the amalgamation the newly acquired shares were cancelled.

The plaintiff claimed as a deduction the purchase price of the shares. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction and deemed the disposal of the shares to be at market value.

### Impact of decision

This decision is of limited application as the wording of the Income Tax Act 2007 requires both a transferee and a transferor.

### Facts

The plaintiff acquired 100% of the shares in North Island Dairy Company Holdings Limited for $2.3 million. It did so intending to amalgamate that company with three others into one unit. As a result of the amalgamation, Kapiti Fine Foods Limited emerged as the new entity and the newly acquired shares were cancelled.

The plaintiff took the position that its purchase of the shares fell within section CD 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the "ITA 1994") as it had bought the shares in order to dispose of them by way of the amalgamation process. This position had the effect of making the shares "trading stock" and "revenue account property".

In its tax return for the year ended March 2004, the plaintiff claimed as a deduction the purchase price of this trading stock, being $2.3 million. It did not have an equivalent income entry attaching to the disposal of the shares by amalgamation.

The Commissioner considered section GD(1) of the ITA 1994 applied to the disposal of the shares so as to deem the plaintiff to have received as income the value of the shares. The Commissioner assessed the market value of the shares to be $2.3 million. The Commissioner also imposed a 20% penalty for an unreasonable tax position.

The plaintiff argued section GD1 did not apply as the section required both a transferor and transferee. The Commissioner argued that this was not a requirement of the ITA 1994.

### Decision

_GD1_  
Section GD 1(1) states:

1.  Subject to subsection (2), where any trading stock is sold or otherwise disposed of without consideration in money or money's worth or for a consideration that is less than the market price ... of the trading stock at the date of the sale or other disposition,-
    1.  the trading stock is, for the purpose of this Act, treated as having been sold at and realised at its market price on the date of the sale or other disposition:
    2.  The price which under this section the trading stock is deemed to have realised shall be treated as gross income of the person selling or otherwise disposing of the trading stock;
    3.  The person acquiring the trading stock shall be deemed to have purchased the trading stock at the price which under this section the trading stock is deemed to have realised.

The Court held that it did not matter that the shares were not disposed of to a purchaser or transferee. The Court acknowledged that in many of these situations the transaction is analysed in terms of creating a transferor and transferee. The Court found that not every situation must be capable of such analysis to properly come within section GD1 of the ITA 1994.

The Court found that a purchaser is irrelevant to the need to adjust the accounts of the owner of the trading stock who has disposed of his property. The plaintiff bought the shares, chose to treat them as trading stock, chose to bring them within its "revenue account property" and claimed the deduction for the purchase price. When the plaintiff then chooses to dispose of the trading stock, there must be an adjustment to its tax position regardless of whether the method of disposal has further implications for a different plaintiff.

The plaintiff argued that at the time of disposition, the shares had nil value, because the amalgamation decision and process required them to be cancelled without consideration being given. The Court rejected this argument and reiterated the Commissioner's analysis that the correct method at which the market value should be assessed is prior to the change in value effected by the disposition. Once cancelled, the shares of course had no value, but prior to the cancellation they were worth $2.3 million and could have been sold.

_Shortfall penalties_  
In relation to the imposition of a shortfall penalty, the Court noted that the scope of section GD1 of the ITA 1994 is far from settled and that the plaintiff advanced a tenable argument.

The Court also took account of the fact that the Income Tax Act 2007 is consistent with the plaintiff's position. Accordingly it considered that a shortfall penalty should not be imposed.

*   I cannot ignore that the wording of the 2007 Act either means I am wrong in my conclusions, or the drafters made the same mistake that the taxpayer has. In such circumstances I consider it incorrect to impose a penalty and accordingly I quash the penalty.

Disputant's application for filing challenge out of time declined
=================================================================

2015 case note - application for filing challenge out of time declined by Taxation Review Authority - exceptional circumstances, challenge of refusal notice, s 89K.

Case

\[2015\] NZTRA 05; TRA 028/14

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This is a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") declining the disputant's application for an extension of time for filing challenge proceedings in relation to default assessments made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner").

### Facts

This was an application by the disputant for an extension of time for filing challenge proceedings based on exceptional circumstances. The challenge proceedings relate to default assessments issued by the Commissioner for two GST periods ending 30 November 2004 and 30 March 2006.

The disputant attempted to file a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") for these two periods outside of the statutory timeframes. The Commissioner's refusal notice declining to accept the NOPA was issued on 3 September 2014. The disputant filed a Notice of Claim in the TRA on 23 December 2014.

Section 89K(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") provides that a disputant is entitled to challenge a refusal notice issued by the Commissioner if proceedings are filed in the TRA "within two months of the notice's issue". Accordingly, the challenge should have been filed by 3 November 2014 to be brought within the requisite time period.

The Commissioner filed a memorandum stating that she will abide by the TRA's decision on the application. Accordingly, she did not file submissions on the matter.

### Decision

Judge Sinclair found that while the events giving rise to the application were regrettable, the disputant had failed to establish exceptional circumstances and the application to extend time for filing and the challenge proceedings were dismissed.

The disputant contended that exceptional circumstances existed in this situation because the application to the TRA was delayed due to the disputant filing a judicial review proceeding in the High Court in error and it was only on 17 December 2014 that he was notified by the Commissioner that the proceeding should have been filed in the TRA.

Furthermore, the disputant claimed any delay was relatively minimal given that the Commissioner was aware of the case and did not advise the disputant of the error for many weeks after the application was filed in the High Court. The disputant went on to say that the Commissioner would have been under no illusion that the disputant was at all times disputing the assessments.

Judge Sinclair, however, found that the failure to commence the challenge proceedings within time came about because an error was made by the disputant's lawyers for which no explanation was given.

In confirming _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fuji Xerox NZ Limited_ (2002) 20 NZTC, she held that the term "exceptional circumstance" has a specific statutory meaning being:

1.  an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant;
2.  that provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not commencing a challenge to a disputable decision within the response period.

An act or omission of an agent (which in this case included the disputant's lawyers) of a disputant will not be an exceptional circumstance unless certain conditions are satisfied. These are that:

1.  the act or omission of the agent was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent;
2.  such event or circumstance could not have been anticipated; and
3.  the effect of the act or circumstance could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct.

Judge Sinclair found that the disputant's situation was not an event or circumstance which was beyond the control of the disputant's agent. She further found the situation was not an event or circumstance that could not have been anticipated. The situation could have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. She concluded, at \[21\], that the failure to file proceedings within time occurred simply because the requisite disputes procedure under the TAA was not followed.

She went on to state that it did not assist the disputant's position that the Commissioner was aware from the history of the dispute proceedings that it was the disputant's intention to dispute the assessments. Further, it was not relevant that the Commissioner took some weeks before she filed her protest to jurisdiction alerting the disputant to the error. The obligation was on the disputant and his advisors to ensure that the challenge proceedings were properly commenced.

Disputes process
================

2011 legislation removes the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority.

* * *

### Removing the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA

**_Sections 3(1), 89E, 89N(1)(vii), 138N(2) and 138O of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections 13A(b)(ii), 13B and 26A(2) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994; regulations 2, 5, 7, 12(2), Part 3, 27(2), 28(b) and the schedule to the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998_**

#### Key features

These provisions have been amended or repealed to reflect the fact that the right to have a dispute heard before the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) has been removed.

#### Background

The small claims jurisdiction of the TRA was established in 1996 as part of the major overhaul of the tax disputes system that took place at that time. The aim of establishing the small claims jurisdiction was to provide taxpayers with a truncated process whereby simple disputes could be heard quickly.

The small claims jurisdiction was used less than 10 times between its establishment and the introduction of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill 2010. There may be numerous reasons why taxpayers did not elect to use this forum, including that the eligibility criteria were relatively restrictive and there was no appeal right against a decision of the TRA acting in its small claims capacity.

The removal of the small claims jurisdiction should not impede the access of smaller tax disputes to the judiciary. An Inland Revenue standard practice statement (SPS 10/04) sets out a number of criteria under which the Commissioner will agree to a truncated disputes process. From a small claims perspective, the key criterion is that a truncated process will be agreed to when the core tax in dispute is under $75,000. This practice will allow taxpayers to have a dispute heard by the TRA's general jurisdiction at around the same time as they would have been able to elect to the small claims jurisdiction under the repealed provisions. The Commissioner intends to release new standard practice statements on the disputes process that reflect these legislative changes. It is anticipated that, under these revised standard practice statements, the $75,000 threshold will be applicable to both taxpayer- and Commissioner-initiated disputes.

It is also important to note that the TRA acting in its general jurisdiction is not necessarily more formal than the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction. Taxpayers are able to represent themselves if they wish. As a Commission of Inquiry, the TRA has considerable flexibility in the procedures adopted, including the ability to ask questions to ensure that the "right" result is reached, irrespective of the tax or legal expertise of the presenting parties.

#### Application date

A taxpayer's right to elect for their dispute to be heard in the small claims jurisdiction was removed from 29 August 2011.

* * *

### Evidence exclusion rule

**_Section 138G of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections 17(2A) and 17(2B) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994_**

#### Key features

The evidence exclusion rule (EER) is contained in section 138G of the TAA. If a tax dispute reaches a hearing authority, the EER previously limited the parties to the issues, propositions of law, facts and evidence contained in their respective Statements of Position (SOP). This rule has been relaxed so that the parties are now only limited to the issues and propositions of law contained in their SOP.

#### Background

When a party to a tax dispute issues a SOP, section 89M of the TAA requires the SOP to contain:

*   an outline of the facts on which they intend to rely;
*   an outline of the evidence on which they intend to rely;
*   an outline of the issues they consider will arise; and
*   the propositions of law on which they intend to rely.

Section 138G reinforced these requirements by providing that, if SOPs have been issued and the dispute reached a hearing authority, the parties could only raise the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law disclosed in their SOP (subject to some discretion afforded to the hearing authority).

The EER was designed to encourage an "all cards on the table" approach to tax disputes. If a party is prevented from using undisclosed material in court, they are effectively compelled to provide the other party with all the material they have that supports their contentions. Another way of looking at the issue is that the EER prevented "trial by ambush", where one party could choose to withhold key information until the dispute has reached the courts.

The policy underlying the EER remains relevant. However, the EER in its previous form had the unintended consequence of encouraging parties to a dispute to produce very lengthy SOPs. The party issuing the SOP may include every potentially relevant fact or piece of evidence in their SOP for fear of being denied the ability to raise information at the court stage. This in turn necessitates the other party having to respond to the relevant parts of the original SOP, as well as set out the differing interpretation and version of events. The result is that SOPs can be large unwieldy documents, a significant portion of which may be irrelevant to the ultimate resolution of the dispute.

The amendments therefore relax the EER so that parties will still be bound to the issues and propositions of law contained in their SOP, but not the facts and evidence. This should allow the parties to enter the challenge phase of a dispute knowing that the dispute has been adequately framed, by issues and propositions of law that cannot easily be amended. However, parties will have more flexibility to introduce new facts and evidence at the hearing authority stage. It is important to note that relaxing the EER does not alter the requirements of the SOP - meaning that the parties are still required to provide an outline of the facts and evidence on which they intend to rely. The difference is that whether new facts and evidence can be raised will be left to the discretion of the relevant hearing authority.

The changes do not affect disputes that reach a hearing authority for which SOPs have not been issued (that is, a truncated dispute). Such disputes remain outside the scope of the EER.

#### Application date

The EER is relaxed in respect of disputes when a disclosure notice was issued on or after 29 August 2011.

* * *

### Exceptional circumstances

**_Sections 3(1), 89K, 89L, 108 and 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

#### Key features

The circumstances in which the Commissioner can accept documents filed out of time in the disputes process have been widened and rules put in place to make the Commissioner's refusal to accept late documents challengeable in the TRA.

The exceptional circumstances test for the Commissioner has also been amended to bring it more in line with the test that applies to taxpayers.

#### Background

The disputes process requires a taxpayer to produce certain documents within a statutory "response period". If documents are not received within the response period the taxpayer is treated as having accepted the position adopted by the Commissioner. This effectively results in the dispute coming to a close in the Commissioner's favour.

However, a taxpayer can file a document outside the response period when exceptional circumstances exist. Exceptional circumstances generally exist when an event outside the control of the taxpayer has prevented the timely filing of a document. An example of an exceptional circumstance is a natural disaster that affects the taxpayer's immediate environment. However, the courts have considered other instances to determine where the boundaries of exceptional circumstances lie, particularly in the context of the similarly worded test in section 138D of the TAA.[1](#1)

The definition of "exceptional circumstances" in section 89K has not actually been amended. Instead the circumstances in which late documents can be accepted have been expanded to include situations where the Commissioner considers that the disputant has a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process at the relevant time. It is anticipated that forthcoming revised standard practice statements on the disputes process will set out in more detail how the Commissioner intends to interpret this provision.

The revised rule applies to the three response periods that apply to a taxpayer engaged in the disputes process under Part IVA. These are the response periods for rejecting a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) from the Commissioner, issuing a NOPA and issuing a Statement of Position (SOP). The expanded test does not apply to the response period for issuing a challenge under section 138, in particular, the exceptional circumstances test under section 138D(2) remains unchanged.

If the Commissioner does not exercise the discretion to accept a late document in favour of the taxpayer, the Commissioner must issue a refusal notice, advising the taxpayer of that decision, within one month of the taxpayer sending the relevant notice.[2](#2)
 In the event that the Commissioner fails to issue a refusal notice within that one-month period, such a notice is treated as being provided at the expiry of that month.[3](#3)

Receipt of an actual or deemed refusal notice allows the taxpayer the right to challenge the notice in the TRA (and the definition of "challenge" in section 3(1) has been updated to reflect this). The challenge must be filed with the TRA within two months of the refusal notice. Because section 89K(6) confers a direct challenge right, the taxpayer is not required to dispute the refusal notice through the issue of a NOPA. In other words, there is no need to start an entirely separate dispute in respect of the refusal notice - any disagreement over the notice can be challenged directly in the TRA.

To reflect the fact that the substantive dispute will effectively be "on hold" in the event that a refusal notice is challenged, the statutory time bars in sections 108 and 108A have been extended to include this period. The extension will be for the period between the date of the refusal notice and the date the subsequent challenge is judged successful by a court or, alternatively, the date the Commissioner concedes.

The exceptional circumstances test that applies to the Commissioner, in section 89L(3), has also been amended to remove reference to changes to a tax law, a new law or a court decision made during the response period.

#### Application date

The revised exceptional circumstances test applies from 29 August 2011.

* * *

### Challenge notices

**_Sections 3(1), 89H, 89J, 89L, 89M, 89P and 138B(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

#### Key features

A statutory notice called a "challenge notice" has been introduced to mark the conclusion of a taxpayer-initiated dispute. These challenge notices will form the basis for any subsequent challenge in the courts. The Commissioner must issue a challenge notice within four years of a dispute being commenced.

#### Background

Under the previous rules, a taxpayer could effectively opt-out of a dispute they had initiated at any time following receipt of the Commissioner's Notice of Response (NOR). This created an asymmetry between disputes initiated by the Commissioner and those initiated by a taxpayer.

Under a Commissioner-initiated dispute (ie, a dispute where the NOPA is issued by the Commissioner), the combined effect of Part IVA was that the Commissioner could generally not issue an amended assessment until after the SOPs had been exchanged. By contrast, a taxpayer could technically initiate a dispute with a NOPA, wait for the Commissioner's NOR and then immediately challenge the assessment in the TRA.

This result created many difficulties. By definition, the Commissioner was generally not aware of an impending taxpayer-initiated dispute until the NOPA was received. The Commissioner therefore had only the two-month response period for the NOR to essentially reach a final view of the adjustment proposed. This runs counter to the "all cards on the table" philosophy underlying the disputes system-especially when it is considered that the Commissioner may wish to conduct an audit as well as issue the NOR within the two-month response period.

To ensure that the full disputes process is followed irrespective of which party commenced the process (other than in defined circumstances, such as when the parties agree to a truncated process), a "challenge notice" has been created to mark the conclusion of a taxpayer-initiated dispute.[4](#4)
 A challenge notice must state that the Commissioner will not be issuing an amended assessment that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed by the taxpayer and that a challenge may proceed.[5](#5)
 The challenge notice is therefore equivalent to an amended assessment for taxpayer-initiated disputes and signals the end of the disputes process under Part IVA and the start of the challenge process under Part VIIIA.

Like an amended assessment, a challenge notice has a time period within which it must be issued. Given that an amended assessment must be issued within four years of the end of the tax year in which the relevant return is provided, section 89O imposes a similar four-year restriction on the challenge notice. The four-year period commences on the date the taxpayer issues their NOPA. If the Commissioner fails to issue a challenge notice within the four-year period, the taxpayer's proposed adjustment is deemed to be accepted.[6](#6)

Under section 89N(3), the Commissioner cannot issue an amended assessment until after the taxpayer's SOP has been considered, unless an exception listed in section 89N(1)(c)applies. To create a parallel for the issue of a challenge notice, section 89P(3) provides that a challenge notice cannot be issued until after the Commissioner has issued a SOP, with the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) still being relevant. No challenge notice is necessary to the extent that a dispute has ended.[7](#7)

If exceptional circumstances exist, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an extension of the four-year timeframe for issuing a challenge notice.[8](#8)

To reflect the existence of the challenge notice, the challenge provisions in section 138B(3) have been amended. A taxpayer can now challenge an assessment when they have issued a NOPA only if the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice. This rule replaces the previous regime (discussed above) under which a taxpayer could opt-out of such disputes after receipt of any "written disputable decision" from the Commissioner rejecting a proposed adjustment.

Consistent with the policy of completing the full disputes process in appropriate cases, section 89M has also been amended to clarify that the Commissioner must issue a SOP in response to a taxpayer's SOP in a taxpayer-initiated dispute.

#### Application date

Because the challenge notice is only relevant for taxpayer-initiated disputes, these changes apply in respect of disputes for which a taxpayer's NOPA was issued after 29 August 2011.

* * *

### Remedial **disputes changes**

#### **Definition of "disputable decision"**

**_Section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

The definition of "disputable decision" has been amended to avoid a duplication that previously existed and to confirm that most notices provided by the Commissioner as part of the disputes process are themselves not "disputable decisions". This is to avoid the possibility of, for example, a SOP being treated as a disputable decision, which can itself be the subject of a taxpayer NOPA. The Act already provides mechanisms to respond to disputes documents.

**_Application date_**

This change applies from 29 August 2011.

#### Extinguishing tax losses

**_Section 89C(1b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Section 89C lists a number of circumstances where the Commissioner is able to issue an amended assessment without having to first issue a NOPA. Subsection (1b) has been added to clarify that the Commissioner does not need to issue a NOPA when the Commissioner has made a decision to write-off tax debt under section 177C. This clarifies that write-off decisions are not intended to be subject to the dispute process.

**_Application date_**

This change applies from 29 August 2011.

#### TRA regulations

**_Regulations 4 and 11(2) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998_**

Regulation 4 has been amended so that it refers to the District Court Rules currently in force, being the District Court Rules 2009. Regulation 11(2) has been amended so that the Commissioner must file and serve a notice of defence within 25 working days of service of a notice of claim (previously 40 working days). This aligns the TRA timeframes with those that operate for standard track proceedings in the High Court.

**_Application date_**

This change applies from 29 August 2011.

#### Shortened process for taxpayer initiated disputes in limited circumstances

**_Section 138B(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

Two of the situations in which the Commissioner can bypass the disputes process under section 89C are:

*   when the relevant facts and law are identical to those for another assessment for the taxpayer in another period;
*   when the assessment will correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer as a consequence of a tax position taken by another taxpayer.

The first of these covers circumstances where a taxpayer has adopted the same tax position in more than one tax period. The second relates to when one taxpayer's position is dependent on the position of another taxpayer, for example, when losses have been transferred between group companies and the denial of those losses will automatically mean they were unable to be transferred. The Commissioner being able to bypass the disputes process in these circumstances reflects that a second dispute may be unnecessary if the outcome is entirely contingent on the result of another dispute.

The new section 138B(4) provides a mirror process for taxpayer-initiated disputes. Under section 138B(4), the taxpayer must notify the Commissioner in writing setting out the proposed adjustment and sufficient details to identify how the adjustment fits into one of the two categories for a fast-track procedure. The two categories are broadly identical to those available to the Commissioner under section 89C (discussed above):

*   The adjustment is in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for another assessment for the taxpayer for another period.
*   The adjustment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer or an associated person as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer-
*   in either case when the other position is the subject of, or was the subject of, court proceedings.

In appropriate cases, this process should allow these subsequent disputes to "catch up" to the main dispute so that the hearing authority can consolidate them if it sees fit.

**_Application date_**

Because these truncated proceedings are only relevant for taxpayer-initiated disputes, these changes apply in respect of disputes for which a taxpayer's NOPA was issued after 29 August 2011.

Disputes resolution process
===========================

Amendments give effect to proposals outlined in the government discussion document 'Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review' released in July 2003.

**_Sections MD1(1), MD1(2), MD(2B) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004; definition of "response period" and "disputable decision" in section 3(1), sections 89C(db) and 89C(eb), 89DA(2), 89E(1), 89F, 89G(2), 89K(1)(a)(ii), 89K(1)(a)(iii), 89K(1)(b)(ii)(A), 89K(1)(b)(ii)(B), 89K(1)(d), 89K(3)(a) and (b), 89M(1), 89M(6B), 89M(7), new sections 89N and 89O, 108B(1), 108B(1B), 113(1), 138B(3) and 138F of the Tax Administration Act 1994; the proviso to section 20(3) and section 45 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985; section 13B(1)(a) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and regulation 18(5) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations_**

### Introduction

Amendments give effect to proposals outlined in the government discussion document "Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review", which was released in July 2003.

The framework within which tax disputes are resolved has been amended to ensure that the process is meeting its intended objectives.

To provide greater certainty and consistency for both Inland Revenue and taxpayers in relation to their returns, amendments have also been made to the refund periods for income tax and goods and services tax.

### Background

Over the last decade a broad package of tax administration reforms has been introduced in response to developments such as increased technology and self-assessment. The areas of reform include:

*   tax simplification, including removal of the requirement for most wage and salary earners to file returns;
*   compliance and penalties legislation;
*   binding rulings;
*   a progressive rewrite of the income tax legislation; and
*   the introduction of legislation supporting taxpayer self-assessment.

It was within this environment of tax administration reform that the disputes resolution process was introduced, in 1996, in response to the recommendations of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, which was chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson.

The disputes procedures at that time were perceived as deficient in that they did not adequately support the early identification and prompt resolution of issues leading to tax disputes. A new disputes resolution process was subsequently introduced to deal with these concerns.

The resolution of a dispute is achieved through a series of steps prescribed in legislation, the main elements of which are:

*   A notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). This is a notice by either the Commissioner or a taxpayer to the other that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer's self-assessment.
*   A notice of response (NOR). The NOR is a notice of response issued by the party receiving the NOPA if they disagree with the NOPA.
*   A disclosure notice and statement of position (SOP). A disclosure notice triggers the issue of a SOP. A SOP contains the detailed facts and legal arguments to support the position taken and, again, is issued by both parties. It is an important document because it limits the parties to their respective facts and arguments if the case goes to court - this limitation is referred to as the "evidence exclusion rule".

The prescribed documents are intended to encourage an all "cards on the table" approach to dispute resolution that ensures that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court. There are also two administrative phases in the process - the conference and adjudication phases. The conference is a relatively formal meeting between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer which aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. Adjudication involves the independent consideration of the dispute by Inland Revenue and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer's assessment is amended.

The process is set out in Figures 1 and 2.

#### The 2003 discussion document

The government discussion document "Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review" was released on 2 July 2003 for public comment. The purpose of the discussion document was to ensure that the government's objective of making the dispute resolution procedure fairer, faster and generally more efficient was being supported by the legislation. The review therefore focused on particular ways in which the legislative process could be improved for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. It recognised, however, that the process for resolving disputes is dependent on efficient administrative practices and noted that Inland Revenue is undertaking a separate review of these practices.

The document covered five broad subject areas:

*   the need for the Commissioner to follow the full process set out in the legislation;
*   the content and the level of detail of the various documents required by the Commissioner and the taxpayer during the dispute;
*   the increasing incidence of taxpayers seeking to adjust their own returns in relation to issues that are likely to be disputed;
*   providing certainty regarding timeframes, including timeframes for GST; and
*   miscellaneous issues.

The document outlined the objective of the review as being to ensure that the administration is operating efficiently at the lowest possible cost and to promote voluntary compliance as a result of disputes being handled fairly and resolved promptly.

#### Changes recommended at select committee

A significant change at the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee stage, when the bill introducing the amendments was being considered, was made to the proposal to require the issue of a NOPA to claim an input tax credit within two years if a credit had not been claimed in the correct period. This provision was changed instead to allow a two-year period to claim an input tax credit in a current period return. Outside of the two-year period, an unlimited time to claim an input tax credit in a current period return will be allowed in limited prescribed circumstances.

Another significant change was to remove from the proposals a provision which would clarify and extend the circumstances in which the Commissioner could override the four-year statute bar in making an assessment.

### Key features

#### Completing the process

Amendments to ensure that the various steps required to facilitate the resolution of a dispute are completed include:

*   New section 89N clarifies that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must, other than in prescribed circumstances, apply all the legislated steps of a dispute
*   Section 108B replaces the current six-month period within which the parties may agree to extend the time available for a dispute with a 12-month period with the ability for the taxpayer to extend that period for a further six months; and
*   Section 89K expands the circumstances in which a document that is provided late by the taxpayer will be accepted by the Commissioner.

#### Improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness

A number of amendments aim to ensure that the disputes resolution process is more accessible to taxpayers and that the costs incurred in preparing the various documents are no greater than is necessary for each particular case. Amendments aimed at achieving this include:

*   simplifying the documentation required by both parties to progress a dispute (amended sections 89F and 89G);
*   requiring a more detailed document when a NOPA is issued by a taxpayer (section 89F);
*   extending the time for taxpayers to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment from two months to four months (amendment to the definition of "response period" in the TAA);
*   introducing a more accessible small claims process which includes raising the threshold for such cases from $15,000 to $30,000 and clarifying that a "precedent" case is one that has wider implications for other taxpayers (sections 13B of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, 89E of the TAA and regulation 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998); and
*   allowing the disputes process to be stayed pending the outcome of a test case if both parties agree (new section 89O).

#### Timeframes for refunds

The revised timeframes for refunds are based on the need to manage government revenue risk and the need to ensure that tax is correctly paid. To achieve this, the timeframes within which tax refunds are allowed (sections MD1(1)and MD1(2) and MD 1(2B) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 and section 45 of the GST Act) have been amended to provide for a four-year period to claim a refund. An eight-year refund period will remain when the overpayment of tax is due to clear mistake or simple oversight.

#### GST input tax deductions

The proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act has been amended to give taxpayers two years, from the earlier of the date of the invoice or payment, to claim an input tax credit in a current period return rather than the unlimited time previously available to taxpayers.

Outside of that two-year period, taxpayers will be able to claim an input tax credit in a current period return only if the failure to claim the credit arose from the following circumstances:

*   a clear mistake or simple oversight by the taxpayers;
*   the inability by the taxpayer to obtain a tax invoice;
*   there has been a dispute over the quantum of the invoice that was not resolved within the two-year period; and
*   it is found only later that a supply is taxable and the taxpayer had not claimed the related input tax credits.

### Application dates

The amendments to the disputes procedures will apply to disputes commenced under Part IVA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on or after 1 April 2005, the time of commencement usually being the issue of a notice of proposed adjustment by either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer, with the following exceptions:

*   Amendments to timeframes within the process (the response periods) will apply to notices issued on or after 1 April 2005. If the response period relates to a GST return, the amendments apply to notices issued in relation to GST return periods starting on or after 1 April 2005.
*   Amendments relating to income tax refunds will apply from the 2004-05 income tax year. Amendments relating to GST refunds and current period input tax deductions will apply for GST taxable periods starting on or after 1 April 2005.
*   Amendments relating to situations where an assessment can be issued without starting the disputes process apply to assessments for which notices are issued on or after 1 April 2005.
*   Amendments to the challenge procedures apply from the date of enactment, 21 December 2004.

### Detailed analysis

#### Starting the disputes process

##### Timeframe for taxpayer-initiated notice of proposed adjustment - definition of "response period"

In recognition of the requirement on taxpayers to provide detailed information to the Commissioner when they initiate a dispute, the definition of "response period" in section 3(1) of the TAA has been amended to give taxpayers four months - instead of two months - to initiate a dispute to their self-assessment, or to dispute a notice of assessment issued by the Commissioner. The period will apply from the date a taxpayer's notice of assessment is received at an office of Inland Revenue. If a taxpayer is issuing a NOPA to their self-assessment, the date of their notice of assessment will be provided to the taxpayer through the issue of a return acknowledgement letter.

In the definition of "response period", the provision of a two-month period starting on the date of issue of a notice from the disputant rejecting an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner is being removed because it is redundant.

#### Efficency and cost effectiveness measures

##### The documentation required as part of the disputes process - sections 89F and 89G

The content of the notice of proposed adjustment is prescribed in section 89F. The amended section 89F requires that both documents issued by the taxpayer or the Commissioner must contain sufficient detail to identify the issues arising between the parties and be in the prescribed form. The section then details further requirements, depending on whether the document is issued by the Commissioner or the taxpayer.

Section 89F(2) requires the Commissioner to identify the adjustments and provide a concise statement of the key facts and law in sufficient detail to ensure the taxpayer is informed of the grounds of the Commissioner's NOPA. The reference to "concise statement of the key facts and law" means that the document should be relatively brief, but at the same time cover all the issues relevant to the dispute. The Commissioner must also state how the law applies to the facts to ensure the proposed adjustment, and the arguments used to support it, are consistent with the proposed facts.

Section 89F(3) requires the taxpayer NOPA to identify the adjustment made to the assessment. The NOPA must also provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the NOPA, a statement of how the law applies to the facts and copies of all material documentary evidence that the taxpayer is aware of at the time the notice is issued in support of the claim.

The need for the taxpayer to provide more detail than the Commissioner in a NOPA was highlighted in chapter 5 of the July 2003 discussion document. The amendment recognises that, because of the greater level of detail that will be required, potential disputes may be resolved at an earlier stage - ideally, without the need for further investigation.

Section 89G(2) requires a notice of response to state concisely the facts, law and arguments the issuer considers to be wrong in the NOPA and the reasons for this. The issuer of the response notice must also include any facts and legal arguments relied on and how the arguments apply to the facts.

Finally, the issuer of the NOR must state concisely an adjustment to any figure referred to in the NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments relied on in the NOR. This requirement ensures that the NOR responds fully to the NOPA. There is no requirement that the amount referred to be final. As the dispute progresses, the amount in dispute may be altered reflecting the outcome of a conference or other discussions between the parties.

These amendments will ensure that there is a balance between allowing some flexibility for taxpayers and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in preparing the documents, so that costs are reduced, and ensuring that both parties have all the information required to adequately address the issues raised in the dispute.

The requirement that the legal arguments are applied to the facts will ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement which appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document but is, rather, a logical conclusion.

##### Test cases - new section 89O

New section 89O has been inserted into the TAA to allow for the suspension of a dispute following the outcome of a test case. The section will apply if a dispute between a taxpayer and the Commissioner has been identified and the Commissioner has designated a case involving another taxpayer as a test case.

If the section does apply, the taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement if there is similarity between the facts and questions of law in the dispute and the case that has been designated as a test case. In such a case, any time bars affecting the dispute are stayed until the earliest of the date of the court's decision, the date on which the test case is otherwise resolved, or the date on which the dispute is otherwise resolved. In agreeing to suspend the dispute, the taxpayer agrees to be assessed (or not as the case may be) on the basis of the test case. In such a case, any time bars affecting the dispute are extended by the period of the suspension.

Enabling the Commissioner to designate a case as a test case earlier in the disputes process will reduce administrative and compliance costs that might otherwise arise if the case involves, say, a taxpayer who is one of a number involved in a single scheme or in a series of similar transactions.

##### Example

The Commissioner has issued Robert with a NOPA, thereby starting the disputes process. Robert and the Commissioner have agreed in writing to suspend the dispute between them because there is significant similarity between Robert and the Commissioner's dispute and a challenge that has been designated as a test case. The time bar to complete Robert's dispute will fall on 31 March 2006.

Section 89O(3) states that the suspension starts on the date of the agreement and ends on the earliest of:

1.  the date of the court's decision in the test case:
2.  the date on which the test case is otherwise resolved:
3.  the date on which the dispute is otherwise resolved.

Robert and the Commissioner agree to suspend the dispute between them on 9 June 2005. The date of the court's decision on the test case is 9 July 2006. Therefore the suspension is from 9 June 2005 to 9 July 2006.

Section 89O(4) states that the Commissioner may make an assessment (as the case may be) that is consistent with the resolution of the test case.

The court's decision on 9 July is in the Commissioner's favour and the Commissioner may make an assessment for Robert that is consistent with the test case.

Because the test case was decided outside of the time bar as it applied to Robert, section 89O(5) determines the period of time within which the Commissioner must make the assessment. The period of time within which the Commissioner must make the assessment for Robert is the total of:

1.  the four year timebar - the time within which the Commissioner should have made the amended assessment in the absence of the suspension; and
2.  the period of the suspension described in section 89O(3).

Therefore the Commissioner must make the amended assessment for Robert on 9 July 2006.

This new test case procedure for disputes does not affect the taxpayer's ability to challenge the assessment through the court process.

##### Small claims process

The government considered that cost should not be a deterrent to using the disputes process, especially for smaller taxpayers, for whom the cost of progressing the dispute may far outweigh the amount of tax in dispute.

An amendment to section 89E and consequential amendments to the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998 are intended to make the small claims process more accessible to taxpayers by:

*   raising the threshold for the amount of tax in dispute from $15,000 to $30,000 (section 89E(1) of the TAA and section 13B(1)(a) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994); and
*   clarifying that "precedent" means the case will be of precedence for taxpayers other than the taxpayer in question (Regulation 18(5) of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulations 1998).

##### Completing the process

#### New section 89N

The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which to amend a taxpayer's assessment following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In cases involving a dispute the assessment is amended following the completion of the disputes process, which must occur within the four-year period (unless the parties agree to a time bar waiver).

New section 89N requires the Commissioner to follow all the legislated steps of the disputes process, other than in specific circumstances. Completing the process means considering the taxpayer's statement of position whether in a Commissioner-initiated dispute or a taxpayer-initiated dispute, before issuing an amended assessment. This requirement is contained in section 89N(2).

The process does not have to be completed before an assessment is issued, in the following circumstances:

*   The Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner's opinion, the disputant, in the course of the dispute committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has effectively delayed the process (89N(1)(c)(i)).

An alleged offence committed by a taxpayer may mean the Commissioner needs to act quickly and issue an amended assessment.

*   A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or an associated person of the taxpayer, may take steps as to the location of the taxpayer's assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax (89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)).

The exception relating to the location of the taxpayer's (or an associated person of the taxpayer's) assets is designed to address the risk of the taxpayer or associated person of the taxpayer seeking to dispose of assets which may be required to meet an outstanding tax liability, and the issue of an assessment becoming urgent.

*   The taxpayer has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute or an associated person of the taxpayer involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings (89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)).

The exception for judicial review proceedings reflects that the parties' resources may be directed away from progressing the dispute through the process towards addressing the facts and issues in the judicial review application.

*   During the dispute, the taxpayer fails to comply with a request under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply within the period that is specified in the request (89N(1)(c)(vi).

Failure by a taxpayer to comply with a request for information if it is necessary to resolve the dispute or to comply with another matter relating to the dispute may, similarly, delay the progression of the dispute within the four-year time bar.

*   The taxpayer elects to have the dispute heard by the Taxation Review Authority acting in its small claims jurisdiction (89N(1)(c)(vii)).

The small claims process is a simpler separate process when the dispute is intended to be resolved without completion of the full disputes process.

*   The taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or the Taxation Review Authority without the completion of the disputes process (89N(1)(c)(viii)).

In some disputes, particularly those involving less tax in dispute and/or less complex issues, both parties may agree that it is more efficient to have the case resolved in the court or the Taxation Review Authority.

*   The taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend the dispute pending a decision in a separate test case that is being challenged (89N(1)(c)(ix)).

If the taxpayer and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case, the process should not be followed.

##### Application to the High Court

Section 89N(3) provides for the Commissioner to apply to the High Court for an order to allow more time for completion of the dispute, or to allow the disputes process not to be completed.

An order from the High Court would be sought if the Commissioner considered that there were reasonable grounds, other than those specifically prescribed, for not having followed the full statutory process. Whether or not there were reasonable grounds could depend, for example, on the complexity of the issues, whether the taxpayer had caused prolonged delays and whether there were significant matters that were unforeseen by either party that provided a justification for delay.

New section 89N(4) states that the application to the High Court must be made within the four year timebar.

New section 89N(5) states that if an application is made, the period of time in which an amended assessment must be made is the total of:

*   the four-year timebar - the time within which the Commissioner should have made the amended assessment in the absence of the application; and
*   the period of time that starts on the date of the application (made within the time bar) and ends on the earliest of:
    *   the date of the High Court's decision of the application:
    *   the date on which the application is otherwise resolved:
    *   the date on which the dispute is otherwise resolved; and
*   any further period directed by the court

##### Example

The Commissioner issues a NOPA on 3 January, and a NOR is issued by the taxpayer two months later, but there is no time to complete the disputes process as the time bar will fall on 31 March. An application is made under section 89N(3) on 11 March - within the four-year time bar - to the High Court. The Commissioner applies for an order that the Commissioner issue the assessment without completing the disputes process, or in the alternative, that there be more time to complete the process.

The Court decides on 6 April that an assessment may be issued without completion of the disputes process. The court allows a further five days to issue the assessment. The time within which the amended assessment must be issued is the total of:

*   the time within which the Commissioner would be required to amend the assessment; and
*   the date of the court's decision; and
*   the further period allowed by the court as a result of the application, that is, five more days.

The amended assessment must be made by 11 April.

##### Commissioner may at any time amend assessments - section 11

The new section will not affect the Commissioner's ability to agree to make an adjustment to an assessment in cases, for example, of clear mistake or simple oversight. Therefore the Commissioner will still be able to amend an assessment under section 113 (which contains the general power to amend assessments) within the four-year statute bar but subject to new section 89N.

##### Disclosure notices - section 89M

A disclosure notice is a simple document which triggers the application of the "evidence exclusion" rule. The rule restricts what the Commissioner and the disputant may raise in a court challenge to matters raised in their respective statements of position.

An amendment to section 89M requires that disclosure notices must be issued, except in situations where the Commissioner does not have to complete the disputes process. To address the consequential issue with regard to the protection of witnesses, new subsection 89M(6B) will clarify that "evidence" when referring to the evidence exclusion rule will refer to the available documentary evidence and does not include a list of witnesses or types of witnesses. Therefore witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. The amendment will also provide more flexibility for the presentation of evidence when cases are being prepared before they go to court.

An amendment to section 89M(7) clarifies which document the disputant is deemed to accept - depending on whether the taxpayer or the disputant initiated the dispute - if the taxpayer does not respond within the response period for the statement of position.

##### Four-year time bar waiver period - section 108B

The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which to amend a taxpayer's assessment following an investigation of the taxpayer or in certain other circumstances.

Previously, taxpayers could agree to extend this four-year time bar by up to six months if more time was required to complete the disputes process. The extension takes the form of a waiver, which must be in the prescribed form and signed and delivered to the Commissioner by a taxpayer before the expiry of the relevant four-year period.

Section 108B(1) extends this six-month period to 12 months to provide sufficient time to complete the disputes process in cases where this time is needed. Again, the extension will apply only when the parties agree. The taxpayer can extend the 12-month period by a further six-month period. This additional six months would not need to be agreed with Inland Revenue

Section 108B(1B) states that the Commissioner will not be able to raise new issues during the waiver period that are not identified and known to both parties before the start of the period.

##### Exceptional circumstances - section 89K

The exceptional circumstances provision allows the Commissioner to accept a late document within the response period if exceptional circumstances apply. The current definition of "exceptional circumstance" was thought to be too restrictive and has, therefore, been extended.

Section 89K has been amended to give the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late document, including a statement of position, outside of the applicable response period if the lateness is minimal or the document is late owing to one or more statutory holidays falling within the response period

##### Example

John is issued with a NOPA on 26 August and must issue a NOR by 25 October. However, Labour Day falls on 25 October. Because a statutory holiday falls within John's response period he has one extra day within which to file his NOR. His NOR is then due on 26 October.

##### Example

Mildred is issued a NOPA on 17 June and but her NOR is not received by 16 August due date. Her NOR is received on 18 August. The Commissioner exercises the discretion in this case to accept the NOR as it is only two days late.

#### Timeframes

##### Timeframes for refunds of excess tax

The refund provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 (sections MD1(1), MD1(2) and MD(2B)) and section 45 Goods and Services Act 1985 have been amended to limit the eight-year refund period to four years.

If the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer has paid excess tax and four years have not passed from the end of the income year or GST return period in which the taxpayer provided the return, the Commissioner must refund the overpayment.

The Commissioner may extend the period to eight years if the overpayment of tax is due to clear mistakes and simple oversights, and for rebate claims. Retaining the eight-year period in cases of clear mistake and simple oversight protects existing taxpayer rights to refunds.

Refunds will still be allowed to be paid by the Commissioner outside of those time limits if application is made to the Commissioner before the expiry of the applicable time limit.

##### GST input tax deductions

The proviso to section 20(3) of the GST Act has been amended to provide for an unconditional two-year time frame from the date of an invoice or payment (whichever is earlier) to claim an input tax deduction in a current period return.

Outside of that two-year period, taxpayers will be able to claim an input tax credit in a current period return in certain limited situations only. There will be an unlimited time to claim an input tax credit in a current period return for the following circumstances:

*   The failure to claim the credit was due to the taxpayer's inability to obtain a tax invoice.

Failure to claim a credit due because the taxpayer was unable to obtain a tax invoice is self-explanatory. Taxpayers should also note that section 24(1) of the GST Act requires that a supplier must, at the request of the registered recipient, provide the recipient with a tax invoice within 28 days of the making of the request.

*   The failure to claim the credit has arisen because there is a dispute over the amount of the invoice that is not resolved within the two-year period.

  
  

##### Example

Mary owns and operates a florist shop and files a GST return on a payments basis. She has arranged for a new supplier to deliver her roses for the busy month of February. Mary discusses over the phone the cost of the first supply of roses. When she receives the invoice, the amount of the invoice far exceeds the estimated price she discussed with the supplier. She does not pay the invoice, which in turn means that she does not claim the associated input tax credit. Mary and the supplier enter into a dispute over the amount of the invoice and the case goes to court. The case is resolved three years after the issue of the invoice in favour of the supplier. Mary pays the supplier and claims the input tax deduction accordingly.

*   The failure to claim the credit arises when only later it is found that a supply is taxable and the taxpayer had not claimed the related input tax credits

##### Example

A church group is registered for GST. The church group carries out repairs and maintenance on the church and the associated hall, which has been rented out on a regular basis for a number of years. The church group has claimed input tax credits in relation to the repairs and maintenance on the church hall, but not the church itself as the church group did not think it was part of its taxable activity and therefore it could not claim the input tax credits. The Commissioner informs the church that the repairs and maintenance are part of its taxable activity and as such is a taxable supply. The church therefore claims the related input tax credits.

*   The failure to claim the credit was due to clear mistake or simple oversight.

##### Example

Dominic owns a hairdressing salon and is registered for GST. He files on a two-monthly, invoice basis. Dominic has a very particular filing system, where every invoice he receives is filed alphabetically, so he knows exactly where each invoice is in order to claim GST input tax credits in the correct period. Dominic goes on holiday and leaves his senior stylist, Toni, in charge of the salon in his absence. Toni receives an invoice from one of the salon's suppliers and instead of filing the invoice alphabetically, as Dominic does, she puts the invoice on top of the cabinet and it is subsequently lost. Two and a half years later, Dominic discovers the invoice. He is outside of the two-year period. The misplaced invoice is an oversight, so Dominic is able to claim the invoice in a current period because the failure to claim the credit was due to clear mistake or simple oversight.

If the taxpayer has not claimed the input tax credit within two years and none of the circumstances as outlined above apply, the taxpayer may apply to the Commissioner for an agreed adjustment. The Commissioner can adjust a return, subject to the general four-year timebar, within the period in which the input tax credit should have been claimed.

#### Minor amendments

##### Disputable decision

A clarification to the definition of "disputable decision" in the interpretation section of the TAA excludes from the definition particular sections of the disputes process that are left to the discretion of the Commissioner.

The decisions left to the Commissioner's discretion that will not be disputable decisions include:

*   section 89K, relating to late actions occurring within the response period;
*   section 89L, which allows the Commissioner to apply for a High Court order to issue a notice rejecting an adjustment proposed by a taxpayer that the Commissioner has accepted or is deemed to have accepted;
*   section 89M(8), which allows the Commissioner to provide additional information to the Commissioner's statement of position in response to the disputant's statement of position;
*   section 89M(10), which allows the Commissioner to apply for a time extension to reply to a disputant's statement of position; and
*   section 89N(3), which allows the Commissioner to apply to the High Court for an order allowing more time to complete the process, or that completion is not required.

The amendments ensure that only substantive issues are disputed and that issues about the process cannot be disputed under the process.

##### When assessments can be issued without a NOPA - section 89C

Section 89C lists the circumstances when the Commissioner may make an assessment without issuing a NOPA. They include when the assessment reflects an agreement between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or when the Commissioner believes a notice may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand.

Two new subsections have been added to the list of circumstances when the Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. New section 89C(db) enables the Commissioner to issue an assessment made in relation to a matter that is identical to an assessment of the taxpayer for another income year that is at the time subject to court proceedings. In this situation the disputes process would have been completed in relation to the earlier assessment, and the purpose of the amendment is to reduce the compliance and administrative costs of going through the process again.

New section 89C(eb) provides that an assessment can be issued if the taxpayer has left New Zealand and may have been involved in fraudulent activity. The new subsection extends the current exception for situations where a notice may cause the taxpayer to leave New Zealand.

##### Minor amendments to the challenge procedures - sections 138B(3)(b) and 138F(1)

Section 138B(3) allows taxpayers to challenge an assessment when the Commissioner has rejected (by issuing a notice of response) a notice of proposed adjustment issued by the taxpayer and the Commissioner does not subsequently issue an amended assessment. The taxpayer must file proceedings within the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner, which may include another form of written correspondence by the Commissioner.

Some confusion has arisen for taxpayers in respect of the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner provided for in section 138B(3)(b). Taxpayers can challenge an assessment if they file proceedings within that response period. This written disputable decision was not intended to be restricted to the notice of response referred to in section 138B(3)(a).

Therefore the amendment clarifies this point by providing that the reference to "within the response period of the written disputable decision from the Commissioner" is not restricted to the notice of response issued by the Commissioner.

The effect of the amendment is that the full disputes process will more clearly be provided for in the case of a taxpayer-initiated dispute as the time for challenging the Commissioner's decision will not be limited to the two months after the Commissioner's notice of response.

Section 138F(1) gives taxpayers the right to challenge an assessment made by the Commissioner that takes account of a disputable decision. This section does not then provide for a response period within which the challenge must be commenced because there is no cross-reference to section 138B, which does provide a response period.

The amendment clarifies that for a challenge made under the section to be effective, the taxpayer must commence the challenge within the response period from the date of the Commissioner's notice of assessment.

Disputing default assessments
=============================

2006 case note - to dispute/challenge a 'default' assessment taxpayer must file the outstanding return and NOPA within response time – disputes resolution process.

Case

Donald Eugene Allen v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

To dispute and then challenge a "default" assessment a taxpayer must file the outstanding return and a NOPA within the response time.

### Facts

The taxpayer failed to furnish returns for income for the years 2000 and 2001. The Commissioner made assessments under section 106 and notified the taxpayer on 8 April 2002. On 15 July 2002 the taxpayer filed a notice of claim in the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) challenging the default assessments. On 31 July he furnished income tax returns for the two years showing his income as nil. On that same date he issued a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) in respect of each assessment.

The Commissioner applied to the TRA to strike out the notice of claim on the grounds the TRA had no jurisdiction to hear the claim. When the TRA declined to strike it out, the Commissioner brought proceedings in the High Court for judicial review of that decision under the Judicature Amendment Ac 1972.

The High Court found for the Commissioner, set aside a decision of the TRA and struck out the proceedings in that Tribunal. The taxpayer then appealed unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal before appealing to the Supreme Court.

### Decision

The method by which the purpose of Part 4A (disputes procedures) of the TAA is advanced involves the issuing of a NOPA which may be disputed, within an appropriate response period, by a Notice of Response (NOR). This process may lead to the Commissioner and the taxpayer accepting the other's position, either affirmatively or by omitting to respond within an applicable response period. If the dispute is not resolved by the Part 4A procedure, the challenge procedure under Part 8A may be invoked by a "disputant".

Unlike the disputes procedure, which is in the nature of a negotiation process, the challenge procedure envisages litigation before a hearing authority, which may be either the TRA or the High Court. The litigation is initiated by the filing of proceedings in accordance with the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 (or regulations made in substitution for those regulations) or in accordance with the High Court Rules, within the response period following the issue of the relevant notice of disputable decision - sections 138B, 138C. The terms of those sections make it plain that there cannot be recourse to litigation unless the disputes procedure under Part 4A has been followed to the extent as set out in the applicable subsection.

At issue is whether the taxpayer complied with the requirements of section 138B(3) of the TAA.

In the present proceedings the taxpayer initially contended that, at least in the case of a taxpayer wishing to contest a default assessment, section 138B(3) does not require compliance with the disputes procedures. However, as the Court of Appeal held, that contention is untenable because the term "adjustment proposed" in section 138B(3) clearly refers to a NOPA. The NOPA is an element of the disputes procedures as set out in Part 4A of the Act. And the reference to the "applicable response period" in section 138B makes sense only if read in light of the provisions of Part 4A. Indeed, if section 138B(3) was not read in light of the provisions of Part 4A there would be no apparent time limits on the steps that must be taken by the Commissioner and the taxpayer respectively, nor would there be any prescribed form for the dialogue to take.

The taxpayer's primary submission before the Supreme Court was that he had complied with the disputes procedure. The taxpayer's argument is that since the defaulting taxpayer "may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period", the taxpayer disputes the default assessment by virtue of filing a return (section 89D(2)). The Commissioner must then either accept the return as filed and issue an assessment or issue a NOPA. In either case the taxpayer may then issue a NOR and subsequently challenge before a Hearing Authority the assessment made by the Commissioner.

The taxpayer supported this argument by reference to the legislative history of section 89D. The Supreme Court found that Parliament could not have meant to give preferential treatment to a defaulting taxpayer. Indeed, quite the opposite is to be inferred, namely that a defaulter must both meet its obligations to furnish a return and be subject to the same time constraints as complying taxpayers. In such a case, of course, the taxpayer's NOPA to the default assessment would be associated with the tax position indicated by the furnished return.

The taxpayer also sought to place reliance on information given to taxpayers in pamphlets and similar publications by the Inland Revenue Department. The Supreme Court found, given the elucidation of the law in the course of this litigation, a taxpayer who relied on Departmental advice between 1996 and 2004, including the taxpayer in the present case, would have been misled by it. That is regrettable but the Court was not persuaded that the Departmental publications bear on the question of interpretation.

The Supreme Court also found that there was no general obligation on a taxpayer under section 89D to issue a NOPA because there is no general obligation to dispute an assessment. If however, a taxpayer wishes to dispute the assessment, the disputes procedure must be complied with and that involves the filing of returns and the issuing of a NOPA.

Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 extends the law on distributions to co-operative company members.

The bill in effect extends the scope of sections DV 11 and CD 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which allow a co-operative company to deduct a distribution to a member if the distribution is in proportion to the sale and purchase of trading stock between the member and the co-operative. Amendments to section DV 11, and new section CD 34B, remove the requirement for strict proportionality by permitting a 20 percent differential. This flexibility is being introduced to reduce compliance costs for co-operative companies that pay dividends on a limited number of shares in excess of those held to match trading stock transactions.

### Background

Previously, section DV 11 allowed a co-operative company to deduct a distribution to a member-shareholder if the distribution was one described in section CD 34. Such a distribution was required to:

*   be made by a resident co-operative company that requires members to hold shares in proportion to their trading stock transactions with the company (say, one share for each kilogram of meat sold to the co-operative); and
*   be in proportion to the member's supply of trading stock to the co-operative.

The distribution was taxable to the member under section CD 2.

### Key features

*   Section CD 34 has been repealed and replaced by section CD 34B, which is slightly broader in scope.
*   Section CD 34B provides that a distribution by a co-operative company to a member on certain types of shares is not a dividend. This applies to shares held in proportion to actual or expected trading stock transactions between the member and the co-operative, and also to a limited number (20 percent) of other shares.
*   Section CD 34B(9) provides an exception to section 125(2) of the Companies Act 1993 for co-operatives that elect deductible dividend treatment for tax purposes, and that provide a copy of the election to the Registrar of Companies. Subsection (9) gives such companies some flexibility in fixing the date of entitlement which establishes members' rights to receive dividends.
*   Section DV 11, which currently provides for a co-operative company to deduct distributions to which section CD 34 applies, now refers to section CD 34B.

### Detailed analysis

New section CD 34B applies to resident co-operative companies that pay dividends to resident members. It describes three types of shares - transaction shares, projected transactions shareholding and limited non-transaction shares. The distinction exists only for the purposes of tax rules relating to deductibility and dividends - the shares may be of the same or different classes for company law purposes.

#### Distributions in proportion to actual or estimated trading stock transactions

Under new section CD 34B, "transaction shares" are those that are held in proportion to trading stock transactions in a season. "Projected transactions shareholding" means shares held in proportion to estimated trading stock transactions in a season.

Distributions paid by a co-operative company on such shares are deductible to the co-operative (section DV 11) and are not a dividend to the member (new section CD 34B(2)(a) and (b)). However, they are taxable to the member (section CD 2).

#### Distributions on limited non-transaction shares

Non-transaction shares are shares that are not held in proportion to actual or estimated trading stock transactions but that nevertheless entitle the member to enter into trading transactions with the co-operative.

A distribution paid by a co-operative to a member on such a share is deductible to the co-operative, and is not a dividend to the member, if:

*   the member holds only a limited number of such shares; and
*   the constitution of the co-operative allows members to hold only a limited number of such shares.

The limit allowed under section CD 34B is the greater of 20 percent of the number of their transaction shares and 20 percent of their projected transactions shareholding.

If the constitution allows any member to hold more non-transaction shares than the 20 percent level, only distributions on transaction shares and projected transactions shareholding will be deductible to the co-operative and will not be a dividend. Distributions to any member on non-transaction shares will not be deductible.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| A is a member of a farmers' meat co-operative company. The company requires each member to hold one share for every 10 kgs of meat the member sells to the co-operative in a season. Members can also hold additional shares up to a maximum of 20 percent of shares held by the member to back their recent or estimated sale of meat to the co-operative. Shares held in excess of this are redeemed by the co-operative at the end of the season.<br><br>A estimates that he will supply 1,000 kg of meat in the 2010-11 season so he purchases 120 shares. He only supplies 800 kg of meat in the season. After the end of the season, in addition to the amount it pays the member for the meat, the co-operative company distributes $1 per share to members for that season so A receives $120. A holds 100 projected transactions shares (80 of which are transaction shares) and 20 limited non-transaction shares for the 2010-11 season. The distribution of $120 is not a dividend under new section CD 34B and is deductible to the co-operative under section DV 11. It is income to the farmer under section CD 2.<br><br>##### Variation<br><br>The co-operative company changes its constitution so that an individual member may hold any number of non-transaction shares. A estimates that he will supply 1,000 kg of meat in the current season, and actually supplies 900 kg. He holds 200 shares. The company pays a $200 dividend on the shares. A holds 100 projected transactions shares and 100 other shares. The $100 paid on the projected transaction shares is deductible to the co-operative and excluded as a dividend. The remaining $100 is non-deductible and may be a dividend.<br><br>In this case, section CD 34B(3)(b) also applies so that distributions on shares other than transaction shares or projected transactions shareholding held by any member (not just A) are not deductible and may be a dividend. |     |

#### Review

As noted earlier, the government proposes to review the tax treatment of distributions from co-operative companies to shareholders later this year. This will enable full consultation on the appropriate treatment of such distributions.

#### Section 125(2) Companies Act 1993

A problem arises for co-operative companies with a particular capital structure that pay dividends to shareholders and have different financial years and trading seasons (for example, a trading year ending 31 March and a financial year ending 31 May).

Under section 125(2) of the Companies Act 1993, there is a maximum 20 working-day period between the time shareholders' entitlements to receive a dividend are determined (the "record date") and the date the company's board resolves to pay the dividend.

This creates a problem for co-operative companies that require shares to be held in proportion to trading stock transactions, pay dividends to shareholders and have a different financial year and trading season. If such companies pay a dividend in respect of a trading season after the end of the equivalent financial year, the record date can be in the new trading season. The appropriate record date should be in the trading season for which the dividend is paid.

Subsection CD 34B(9) therefore provides an exception to the 20 working-day rule, in relation to entitlements to receive distributions, for co-operative companies that have elected the tax treatment in section CD 34B. However, the exception applies in relation to all shares of the co-operative that entitle a member to enter into trading stock transactions. That is, the 20 percent limitation that applies for tax purposes does not apply for the purposes of the exception to the Companies Act 1993.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Example |     |
| A Co is a co-operative company whose members hold one share for each 10 kg of meat they supply to the co-operative. It has a trading season of 1 April to 31 March and a financial year of 1 June to 31 May. It intends to pay a dividend based on its 2010-11 trading season on 1 August 2011, after the end of its 2010-11 financial year. It wants to pay that dividend to members in relation to their shareholding in the 2010-11 trading season.<br><br>It elects under section CD 34B to deduct the dividends paid on its shares and also gives a copy of the election notice to the Registrar of Companies. It resolves to fix a record date for all future distributions of 31 March, being the last day of its trading season. As this resolution was made before the end of the 2010-11 trading season, the board can resolve to pay a dividend on 1 August 2011, in respect of the 2010-11 trading season, based on shareholding at 31 March. |     |

### Application date

The amendments will apply to distributions made on or after 1 April 2010.

Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmap 2024-25 highlights the progress we are making towards our diversity and inclusion goals of a Diverse Workforce, Inclusive Workplace, and Leadership and Accountability. It also details our focus for the coming year on three key areas: • supporting the sustainability of our people-led networks • enabling our people to develop and grow their capability through learning and development opportunities • supporting leaders by mitigating bias in their decision making and recognising and harnessing the value of diverse teams. At Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake everything starts and ends with people. Our people are the reason we can do our work and make our workplace a great place to be. Our work is driven by our aspiration – improving oranga for current and future generations. We recognise that we make our biggest contribution to oranga though the activities we support and deliver to our customers. This year, we have continued our strong focus and commitment to responding to the needs of our diverse workforce and building an inclusive workplace for everyone. We do this by providing a workplace where everyone can feel respected, valued, and supported to do their best work every day, regardless of background. Through embracing diversity our people understand the needs of the many different communities we serve. Diverse teams bring different perspectives, which helps stimulate creativity and innovation. We also support leaders to recognise the value diversity brings and celebrate the contribution people make. 4 INTRODUCTION Our progress to date includes continuing to reduce our gender and ethnic pay gaps, people having increased feelings of inclusion, and improvements across a range of our diversity and inclusion people practices. It is important to recognise that many of the areas of focus over the last year are longer term and we will continue to progress these over the next 12-24 months. The actions outlined in this roadmap continue to support the goals in Kia Toipoto – Public Service Pay Gaps Action Plan, along with the five priority areas set out in the Papa Pounamu diversity and inclusion work programme for the wider Public Service. I am proud of the progress we are making towards achieving our diversity, equity and inclusion goals so that everyone across Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake feels respected, valued and is able to reach their potential and do a great job. 5 Our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion These goals are supported and reinforced through Kia Toipoto – Public Service Pay Gaps Action Plan guidance, and are aligned with Papa Pounamu, which sets the diversity and inclusion work programme for the wider Public Service, with guidance from Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. This Diversity, Equity and Inclusion roadmap is complemented by an equal focus on supporting the career development of Māori. These actions can be found in our Māori representation roadmap. Our focus continues to respond to the needs of our diverse workforce, providing people from different communities with what they need to perform at their best. This means supporting leaders to lead diverse people, enabling them to achieve their goals, grow in their roles and contribute to organisational priorities. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake is committed to building an inclusive workplace free from inequalities for our 4,486 people (headcount as of 30 June 2024), where all our people are valued, respected, and feel supported to reach their full potential. Our approach is based around our 3 diversity and inclusion strategic goals: • Diverse workforce - We will break down barriers to inclusion, and celebrate, retain, develop, and attract a truly diverse workforce that is representative of the communities we serve. • Inclusive workplace - We will create a safe and open working environment where all our people feel able to grow and do their best work without fear of embarrassment or retaliation. • Leadership and accountability - We will actively demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive culture through our leadership, and we will hold ourselves accountable for our progress. 6 The following is a summary of the 2023/24 roadmap activities that have contributed to our progress. Reflections of the last 12 months 7 Diverse Workforce • We have reviewed our talent acquisition processes to address barriers to development and career progression for Māori and Pacific peoples. This helps us create a diverse talent pipeline for leadership and senior technical roles. We will continue working in partnership with Māori and Pacific peoples to support a shift in representation. • Our Active Listening programme informs our understanding of the experience people have working at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. This includes regular pulse surveys (our PX Pulse) and surveys across the employee life cycle such as joining or leaving the organisation (Moments that Matter). The latest to be launched was our external candidate experience survey. This will help us understand the experience of applying and being interviewed for a role. Through our suite of surveys, our people tell us they like our supportive and inclusive environment. 1 GOAL 1: 8 Inclusive Workplace • We have created a new Reasonable Accommodation policy and guidelines to help meet the individual needs of disabled people. This year we joined the New Zealand Disability Employers’ Network to review our practices and identify new opportunities for improvement for disabled and neurodiverse people both within Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake and our customers. • Our property programme has continued to improve to ensure that projects are accessible and enhance our people’s wellbeing. A key achievement relates to the guidance for all future projects to include accessibility as a key consideration, and members of our Diversability People Network are included as part of Business Engagement Groups (BEG) for property projects. See our roadmap section for further work in the property programme. • Our people networks have continued to thrive and are well established as key stakeholders in many initiatives. They have updated guidance on how to set up networks and delivered Network Role Guidance for members and leaders. This supports the understanding of the role and value of people networks in supporting capability development and growth of network members. Our people networks help people across the organisation to learn about diverse groups and have contributed to significant initiatives, such as our Reasonable Accommodation policy and reaccreditation with the Rainbow Tick. 2 GOAL 2: 9 Leadership & Accountability • Te Pou o te Tangata – how we do things at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake was designed with our people including our people-led networks, with a focus on amplifying the voices of underrepresented communities. In the past year we have delivered comprehensive leadership learning to support leaders to lead in an inclusive way. • We have continued embedding our flexible working policy and approach, encouraging solution-focused conversations between leaders and their people. The last 12 months has seen leadership teams working together to promote consistency in decision-making and reflecting on what a principle-based approach to flexible working means within their business group contexts. • We continue to strengthen what we do to protect our people from harm at work, promoting positive ways to support wellbeing and resilience, and supporting recovery or accommodating illness when needed. We have reviewed our employee assistance programme offerings and have a new provider with wellbeing resources. • We have progressed work on resources to support our Māori capability programme Te Awatea, launching in the upcoming year. 3 GOAL 3: 10 Engaging with our people 11 Engaging with our people Understanding our people’s experiences When developing our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion roadmap, we committed to understanding the experiences of Māori and Pacific peoples, in terms of developing careers and the barriers that have been faced. We have worked in partnership to establish actions that will create a positive impact on Māori and Pacific representation, and in turn reduce the pay gaps. This Diversity, Equity and Inclusion roadmap responds to the insights we have gathered from our people to identify tangible actions that can bring meaningful change for underrepresented communities at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. Alongside this roadmap is our Māori Representation roadmap – this includes activities specifically focused on enabling meaningful change in Māori representation. Developing our roadmap Our journey to develop this roadmap has been supported through engagement with a range of stakeholders; this includes: • our people networks (Tagata Pasifika, Wāhine Tūhono – Women’s Network, He Toa Takitini - Rainbow Network, Diversability Network and Multicultural Network) • whānau Māori members from across Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake • our 3 unions (PSA, Taxpro and NUPE) with on-going significant support from PSA Rūnanga and Tagata Moana Delegates and Taxpro representatives from Māori and Pasifika communities • senior leaders and business partners • representatives of business groups who provide or support services that enable our diversity equity and inclusion goals. 12 What are we trying to achieve? Representation goals Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake wants to be representative of all the communities we serve and see diversity at all levels of the organisation. Diverse teams bring different perspectives together, stimulating creativity and innovation, which lead to new ideas and solutions. Embracing diversity in our workplace means our people understand the needs of the diverse communities we serve, which informs the way we design and deliver our policies, products, functions and services. We aim to improve diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect New Zealand’s population. There are 3 key areas of our work programme that support a positive shift in representation over time. • Career development – supporting our people to build fulfilling careers at our organisation. This will help people develop capability and successfully move to senior roles and roles of influence. • Talent attraction – thinking about how we attract diverse candidates to want to apply to work at our organisation, at all levels. • Talent selection – supporting candidates to do their best, and also supporting leaders to make non-biased decisions and engage with candidates with diverse values and worldviews. The representation areas where we have a clear opportunity to create positive change are: • representation in senior positions across all non-European ethnicities - both people and technical leadership • representation of women in non-people leader roles with pay between $150,000 and $210,000 - these are generally higher- level technical roles • increased representation of Pacific peoples across all levels of people leadership • increased representation of Pacific peoples across higher level/higher paid technical roles • increased Asian representation across all levels of leadership • increased representation of disabled people and members of LGBTTQIA+ (rainbow) communities across all roles. For Māori representation goals – please refer to our Māori representation roadmap. 13 Our people tell us they like our supportive and inclusive environment. Over the past year, 89% of staff who responded to our people experience survey felt ‘mostly included’ or ‘really included’ in their day-to-day experience at work. This has continued to trend in a more positive direction since the survey was introduced in 2020. The themes remain consistent when we compare this across all ethnicity and gender groups at similar role levels. We integrate health and safety into all our activities and encourage everyone to show manaakitanga. We continue to develop resources and guidance to support leaders to understand the wide range of factors that can impact the quality of mentally healthy work. This understanding can assist leaders to work with their people to improve any obstacles to a great work experience. On average over the last year, 67% of respondents to surveys rated their wellbeing as ‘good’ or ‘very good’. 75% of respondents felt ‘good’ or ‘very good’ about their day-to-day work experience. 62% of our people are strong advocates for Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake as a great place to work, and 79% of those leaving told us that we delivered well against those things they value most from an employer. Our internal candidates feel Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has an inclusive interview process with 85% feeling they could bring their whole self to the interview.

Pay gaps 16 The current average gender pay gap is 14.6%. This has reduced from 20.6% since 2016. Our analysis shows the following: • There are minimal like-for-like gender pay differences within roles. • Where the average salary differs within roles, this can be attributed to factors such as capability, tenure or length of time in roles. • Our gender balance across male and female in leadership is at levels we are satisfied with, and we aim to maintain this. When referring to gender pay, the measurements do not include employees that identify outside the gender binary, due to limited numbers and the risk associated with publishing figures that may cause individual employee data to be identified. Gender pay gaps Gender pay gaps Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has continued to take deliberate action to ensure gender and ethnicity are not a determining factor in what people get paid. The drivers of our gender and ethnic pay gaps relate to representation. This means that although we have diversity within our frontline roles and lower paid roles, the level of diversity reduces in higher paid, more senior or influential roles. 17 The median gender pay gap has decreased by 3.8% and the average pay gap has decreased by 6% since 2016. Average and median gender pay gaps over time (2016-2024) 24.7% 20162017201820192020202120222023 24.2% 24.5% 25.8% 26.1% 23.8% 23.0% 20.9% 20.6% 19.6%19.4% 18.8% 17.9% 18.3% 17.7% 14.6% Median gender pay gap Average gender pay gap2024 20.4% 16.9% 18 Gender pay gaps The gender pay gap is driven by representation. There is a high proportion of women in frontline and lower paid roles at almost 70%, for example, Customer Service Officers. We do not intend to force a change here, but see this as an opportunity for women to enter the organisation and create a pipeline for future talent. For this reason, Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake is likely to always have a gender pay gap of >10%. Our pay gap is not driven by within-role difference but by uneven representation across roles. Women are less represented than men in roles earning above $150,000. At senior leadership level (tiers 1-3) female representation is 54%, management level (tiers 4-5) is 46%, and team lead level is 66% (as at 30 June 2024). Female representation has increased for management and team lead roles, but has decreased for senior management roles since 2023. OF WOMEN: are in senior leadership level roles (tiers 1-3) 54% hold team lead level positions 46% work in frontline and lower paid roles 70% 19 Female representation by organisation level from 2023 to 2024 Female representation has increased for management and team lead roles, but has decreased for senior management roles since 2023. 54% Senior Management -9% 66% +1% Team Leader 68% No change Staff +1% Management 46% 20 Female representation begins to drop below 50% for roles above $150,000. Generally there has been an improvement year-on-year. Since 2021, the remuneration point where female representation dips below 50% is getting higher.

Our analysis of ethnicity pay gaps show the following (data from 30 July 2024): • The average pay for men/tāne is higher than that for women/ wāhine across all ethnicities except European women. • The current average ethnicity pay gaps are 13.4% for Pacific peoples, 15.9% for Asian, 8.45% for Middle Eastern, Latin American and African people (MELAA), and 8.06% for Māori. • The pay gaps are significantly higher for women – with a pay gap of 21% for Māori wāhine, 24% for Asian women and 24% for Pacific women. • Over the past five years pay gaps have been decreasing across all groups except for Asian women, which has increased. This is likely due to an increased number of Asian new hires in frontline roles. As with gender, representation is the primary reason for Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake’s ethnicity pay gaps. A large proportion of Māori, Pacific peoples, Asian and MELAA people are in lower paid roles, and a smaller proportion are in higher paid roles. Within roles, like-for-like pay differences are minimal. We will continue to review within role analysis as the population shifts to ensure no pay gaps are created. AVERAGE ETHNICITY PAY GAPS: AsianMāoriPacific Peoples 13.4%15.9%8.1% Ethnicity pay gaps 22 Pay gaps by ethnicity 2023–2024 Ethnicity pay gaps The average pay gap has increased for Asian, and Pacific peoples but decreased for MELAA, European and Māori. One of the drivers of the increase in the Asian pay gap is a high level of recruitment in front line and lower paid roles.

New Zealand’s working- age population is 15% Māori, 7% Pacific peoples. Representation for Asian, MELAA and Pacific peoples at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake is higher than in the New Zealand working population, but lower for European, Māori and other ethnicities. However, the diversity is concentrated within our front-line roles and lower paid roles. In our higher paid, more senior or influential roles there is less diverse representation. Over the past year, our representation for most non-European groups has increased, and remained stable for Māori.

Group pay gaps are calculated as the difference between the average salary for a group and the average salary of all those not in that group, expressed as a percentage of the average salary of those not in that group. For female pay gaps by ethnicity, the comparator group is males from all ethnicities – calculated as the difference between the average pay for all men and the average pay for women of the ethnic group, expressed as a percentage of the average pay for men. The percentage of our people who have declared their ethnicity is 85.4% as at July 2024 (3,973 compared to 664 who have not declared their ethnicity). There are 194 ethnicities that an individual may select, and these are categorised into Asian, European, Māori, MELAA, Pacific peoples, other ethnicities, and did not declare. Disabled people and members of Rainbow communities Our representation and pay gap data about disabled and Rainbow employees at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake is limited. We gather information about new starters, including if they self-identify as having a disability but declaring this information is not compulsory. We can use Te Taunaki Public Service Census data to help us form insights about representation of these groups. As this survey is confidential, it is likely to have an increased uptake, and therefore provide us with more robust data. Median and average pay by gender and ethnicity European $80k $60k $40k $20k 0 $100k $120k Māori Female/Wahine Male/Tāne Pacific Peoples MELAAAsian The average and median pay is lower for Pacific, Asian, Māori and MELAA women and highest for European men. 27 Focus on Pacific peoples’ representation Pacific peoples make up 9.3% of our workforce, with 7% being Pacific women. The New Zealand population is approximately 8% Pacific peoples. Today we currently have a 13.5% pay gap across all Pacific peoples and 24.6% for Pacific women, being the largest pay gap for any Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake population. As with our all pay gaps, our Pacific peoples’ pay gap is driven by representation. Our data shows that 46% of our Pacific people are in Customer Service Officer Level 1 roles - this is one of the lowest paid roles in the organisation. Representation in the Team Lead group is 9.2%, reducing to just 3.7% in management (tier 4-5) and 2.9% in senior leadership (tier 1-3) level roles.

The experiences they have shared cross many of our people processes, leadership including the capability of people leaders, the behaviours we demonstrate and our working environment in general. We have worked in partnership to establish the way forward and a series of actions to continue to support a positive shift in representation of our Pacific people. Taking action Engagement and insights from across our Pacific community have informed actions in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmaps. These include: • leadership development • recruitment practices that are inclusive of cultural needs and create a supportive experience for Pacific peoples • an open and visible approach to set people up for success when they apply for external development programmes aimed at underrepresented communities. We are also supporting the progress of a development programme for Pacific peoples, developed with Pacific peoples. Other actions in this roadmap that relate to our talent system, access to learning that supports individual needs and the cultural capability of people leaders will all contribute to creating a positive change to Pacific peoples’ representation. Creating outcomes The overall outcome of this focus is to support a positive shift in the representation of Pacific peoples at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake, and to enable increased outcomes for Pacific peoples in terms of career development and aspirations. For specific representation outcomes see the Representation goals section of the roadmap. Focus on Pacific peoples’ representation 31 Based on data collected from our people at the time of onboarding, only 4.3% of our people have told us that they have a disability. But with disabled people accounting for 24% of New Zealand’s population , we know that this number is likely to be significantly higher. Disability takes many forms – some are visible, and many are hidden. Some people are disabled by society but may not identify as having a disability. We want all people at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake to be supported to perform at their best. We have an on-going focus on removing barriers to employment and ensuring that our practices, processes and tools are inclusive and enabling for all. “Nothing about us without us” This is the principle that we work to when focusing on work that supports our people with disabilities. We will work collaboratively with the disabled community to develop, review and implement our actions that enable them. Accessibility Tick assessment In the 23/24 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmap we committed to working with the Diversability Network to explore the New Zealand Disability Employer’s Network and the Accessibility Tick. Our aims of doing so were to understand our current state and any areas of improvement needed to be inclusive of disabled and neurodivergent people. An initial assessment has provided us with useful advice on where we might improve. These will be worked through with the Diversability community and different parts of the organisation to identify the actions that we already have underway and any new opportunities for improvement that align with Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake’s priorities. Our focus for 2024/2025 Focus on disability 32 Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion roadmap Many of the actions that were initiated over previous years are now being embedded, are part of business as usual, or are part of a continuous cycle of improvement. These actions are not captured as part of this roadmap, which sets out new actions or actions yet to be completed. 33 GOAL 1: DIVERSE WORKFORCE We will break down barriers to inclusion, and celebrate, retain, develop, and attract a truly diverse workforce that is representative of the communities we serve. This focus includes actions to mitigate bias in recruitment, career development and talent system to enable purposeful focus and equitable outcomes. Supporting the recruitment, development and aspirations of people from underrepresented groups, by working in partnership with them, will support a positive shift in representation at all levels of the organisation. We continue to support leaders to recognise and value the benefits of diversity of thought, ideas, and cultural competency to improve business outcomes.

Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Roadmap includes our progress and action relating to Kia Toipoto. This roadmap is published both internally and externally on Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake’s website. For the second year, we have created a Māori representation roadmap in partnership with Māori - including data and actions to achieve equitable outcomes for Māori. Agencies and entities ensure easy access to human resources and remuneration policies, including salary bands. All Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake policies are available for our people on our internal intranet Haukāinga. This includes all human resources policies and remuneration information. Ngā Hua Tōkeke mō te Utu – Equitable pay outcomes By the end of 2022, entities ensure that starting salaries and salaries for the same or similar roles are not influenced by bias. Our banded and graded pay structures mitigate bias by removing the role of a single leader in pay decisions. Our remuneration structure is robust, with controls for the potential for bias. Starting salaries for same or similar roles are based on pay bands and capability. Agencies monitor starting salaries and salaries for the same or similar roles to ensure gender and ethnic pay gaps do not reopen. On-going scans check for any flags in same or similar roles and trigger further investigation. Pay equity processes are used to address claims and reduce the impact of occupational segregation. Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has been party to two pay equity claims and follows the lead of Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission. Te whai kanohi i ngā taumata katoa – Leadership and representation By the end of April 2023 agencies/entities have plans and targets to improve gender and ethnic representation in their workforce and leadership. By the end of 2024 the Public Service workforce and leadership are substantially more representative of society. See the Measuring Change section of this roadmap. We have achieved gender balanced leadership between men and women at all levels of leadership. We are focusing on shifting representation – see our Representation Goals section. Te Whakawhanaketanga i te Aramahi – Effective career and leadership development By mid-2023, agencies/entities have career pathways and equitable progression opportunities that support women, Māori, Pacific peoples and ethnic employees to achieve their career aspirations The foundations are in place for Whanake – our performance approach, capability-based roles, and talent management. We are now focusing on embedding and evolving these inclusive people practices, and focusing on reducing the barriers to career development for Māori and Pacific peoples. 38 KIA TOIPOTO AREAMILESTONEINLAND REVENUE TE TARI TAAKE PROGRESS Te whakakore i te katoa o ngā momo whakatoihara, haukume anō hoki – Eliminating all forms of bias and discrimination By the end of 2023 entities have remuneration and human resources (HR) systems, policies and practices designed to remove all forms of bias and discrimination. In 2018, we introduced a new pay approach and continued to embed it over 2019. Our banded and graded pay structures mitigate bias by removing the role of a single leader in pay decisions. Both pay approaches prioritise larger increases for those paid lower in the pay range. We know that our remuneration structure is robust, with controls for the potential for bias. Agencies embed and monitor the impact of bias-free HR and remuneration policies and practices. We continue to embed learning around the role bias can play in the decisions leaders make and review our HR practices and polices regularly to mitigate bias. Agencies/entities ensure leaders and employees learn about and demonstrate cultural competence. Our people networks are well supported and help to create awareness and learning of a range of different cultures at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. Cultural competency learning is available for all our people, with tools and systems in development or being embedded to put learning into practice through the decisions leaders need to make about their people. Te Taunoa o te Mahi Pīngore – Flexible work by default By the end of 2024 agencies and entities offer equitable access to flexible-by-default working and ensure it does not undermine career progression or pay. Our refreshed Flexible Working Policy and Guidelines were released in 2021 and are aligned with the flexible-by-default guidelines. Our policy reinforces a principles-based approach to flexibility. We are now focusing on leadership capability to lead in a flexible by default way, and to embed our approach, with a particular focus on location-flexible working. Te Kawa Mataaho Public Service Commission will be producing revised guidance on Flexible Work by Default and Hybrid Working Arrangements and during 2024/25 we will update our policies to reflect this. 39 Papa Pounamu 40 FOCUS AREAHOW INLAND REVENUE TE TARI TAAKE IS FOCUSING ON THIS Te Urupare i te Mariu Addressing bias We will continue to ensure all our people undertake unconscious bias learning.

Hautūtanga kākano rau Fostering diverse leadership Having leaders who reflect the diversity of New Zealand’s communities means we are more likely to understand diverse perspectives, value different worldviews, avoid assumptions and address bias. We actively support and develop future leaders from communities that have traditionally been underrepresented within the Public Service.

Diversity equity inclusion (2023)
=================================

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue wants to be representative of all the communities we serve. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace free from inequalities, where everyone feels valued, respected and supported to reach their full potential.

Our Commissioner Peter Mersi co-leads Papa Pounamu, the initiative that sets the diversity and inclusion work programme for the Public Service. The areas of focus are:

*   Te Urupare i te mariu – Addressing bias
*   Hautūtanga ngākau tuwhera – Inclusive leadership
*   Te whakawhanaungatanga – Building relationships
*   Te āheinga ā-ahurea – Cultural competency
*   Ngā tūhononga e kōkiritia ana e ngā kaimahi – employee-led networks.

To make meaningful changes in these focus areas, and build on them further, we have set 3 goals:

*   Inclusive workplace
*   Diverse workforce
*   Leadership and accountability

These goals are supported and reinforced through focused work on gender and ethnicity pay gaps. Here, we also align with Kia Toipoto, the set of actions to help close gender, Māori, Pacific Peoples and ethnic pay gaps in the Public Service.

We are seeing the impacts from our focus on increasing diversity and inclusion:

*   Over this year, 86% of staff who responded to our people experience survey felt ‘mostly included’ or ‘really included’ in their day-to-day experience at work.
*   Our people tell us they like our flexible, supportive and inclusive environment—this is helping to attract people to work here.
*   Gender and ethnic pay gaps have continued to fall.
*   Our different people networks are helping to improve our services.

There’s more detailed information in our current roadmap for increasing diversity and inclusion at

[www.ird.govt.nz](https://www.ird.govt.nz/)
[](https://www.ird.govt.nz/)

An updated roadmap will be available online from November 2023.

Our work programmes across diversity, equity and inclusion, Māori-Crown relations and our people strategy are designed to ensure everyone receives fair and equitable treatment.

Show all

Addressing bias | Te urupare i te mariu 

### Unconscious bias

Unconscious bias can impact us all—we acknowledge the importance of our people identifying and knowing how to address it. Training is a core part of induction, with guidance for all leaders to embed learning about unconscious bias into how we work.

76% of our current workforce have completed unconscious bias learning.

Our learning has been updated with a refresher module to specifically address bias in recruitment. We’re also reviewing guidance for hiring leaders and recruitment panel members.

### Gender and ethnic pay gaps

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has been working over a number of years to ensure gender and ethnicity are not a determining factor in what people get paid.

The drivers of our pay gaps relate to representation. This means that, although we have diversity within our frontline roles and lower paid roles, diversity reduces in higher paid, more senior or influential roles.

Our average gender pay gap has fallen from 17.7% in June 2022 to 16.0% in June 2023. On average, there is no gap for both men and women in the same or similar roles.

However, women are less represented than men in roles earning above $116,000. Since 2022, their representation has decreased in roles earning between $170,000 and $209,000.

Where the average salary differs within roles, this can be attributed to factors such as experience, age or length of service.

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has a much higher proportion of women in lower paid roles than men.

We began analysing the ethnic pay gap in 2020 - we’ve found it is driven by representation, the same as for gender. Our employee ethnicity range closely reflects that of Aotearoa.

### Recruiting, developing and retaining diversity

We continue to build our people’s awareness of bias in decision-making, work to develop diverse talent into senior and technical roles and help leaders recruit diverse talent at all levels.

A relatively low turnover, particularly in senior and influential roles, means a shift to equal gender and ethnic representation will happen over time.

We’re looking at the ways we seek and select Māori and Pacific Peoples to join us. This includes working with our internal people-led networks to understand the different experiences people have here, and barriers to development and career progression.

We partner with Tupu Toa and Te Tari Mātāwaka, the Ministry of Ethnic Communities to increase diversity amongst our young graduates—we’re working to further develop our graduate network.

We rank in the top 2 of New Zealand’s graduate employers in Government and Public Service. Our most popular graduate role is the position of Graduate Policy Advisor.

Our group that works with business customers is introducing its own graduate programme, with recruitment starting in Feburary 2024.

Hautūtanga ngākau tuwhera | Inclusive leadership

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue promotes inclusive leadership throughout our people practices. This involves addressing bias and building inclusion into equitable pay, career development and progression opportunities.

We provide tools and guidance for leaders to develop their understanding of how to be an inclusive leader. Leaders are required to complete training in areas such as mental health and addressing unconscious bias.

93% of our people leaders have completed unconscious bias learning.

Our recruitment systems and processes have been refreshed this year to ensure leaders know how to create an inclusive experience for candidates. 

As part of our performance approach, leaders are supported to help their people achieve in ways that work for them through tailored coaching and development.

Te whakawhanaungatanga | Building relationships

Building relationships that create honesty and trust among our people, and that encourage diverse perspectives, help to improve things for our people and customers.

As noted here, new organisational behaviours put whanaungatanga (relationships) and manaakitanga (lifting up) deliberately at the centre of how we do things every day.

[Our people](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/about-us/our-people)

These concepts matter especially when people from our organisation team up to work on priorities, sometimes at short notice. They also underpin the way our teams work in communities, as you can read about here.

[Revitalising our work in communities](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/collecting-new-zealands-revenue-is-what-were-here-to-do/revitalising-our-work-in-communities)

Te āheinga ā-ahurea Cultural competence

The approach at Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue to building Māori cultural capability comes under our wider te Tiriti o Waitangi strategy, Māhutonga. You can read about Māhutonga here.

[Becoming a Tiriti based organisation](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/about-us/becoming-a-tiriti-based-organisation)

This year, we’ve supported leaders to keep driving cultural competency learning with their teams, celebrate language weeks including New Zealand Sign Language Week, and practise basic cultural elements regularly.

Mana Āki online learning has been available since May 2021. Mana Āki was developed by Hīkina Whakatutuki, the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment. It gives teams ways to reflect on how we think about and interact with colleagues and customers from different cultures. We’ll continue to review, promote and add to our cultural capability learning over time.

5.9% of our people have completed Mana Aki learning as at 30 June 2023. 21.3% have either completed or have actively used it.

18.2% of our current staff have engaged with Mana Aki over the last 2 years.

Ngā tūhononga e kōkiritia ana e ngā kaimahi | Employee-led networks

Employee or people-led networks play a significant role in making our workplaces inclusive. The networks foster many opportunities for our people to grow connections, create a sense of belonging and build their capabilities. 

The networks have thrived and contributed to some critical organisational decision-making. For example, development of our new organisational behaviours, workforce planning, technology changes, and initiatives for health, safety, wellbeing and learning and development.

The Diversability Network is helping us to build a welcoming environment for people with visible and invisible disabilities. 7% of our people indicated they have a disability in the 2021 Te Taunaki Public Service Census.

He Toa Takitini Rainbow Network helped us get reaccredited with the Rainbow Tick in September 2022. The Tick recognises our continued mahi to be a safe place where people from the rainbow communities can feel they belong.

The Rainbow Tick Organisation, which reaccredited us, commended work such as our initiative for validating a customer’s identity when their voice does not match their expected or assumed gender.

Using plain language and making our communications clearer has also been a key focus as it helps both our customers and people when our information is easy to read and understand.

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue currently provides executive sponsorship and financial support to help these networks deliver their annual network plans:

*   Tagata Pasifika Network
*   He Toa Takitini Rainbow Network
*   Wāhine Tūhono Women’s Network
*   Diversability Network
*   Multicultural Network.

We also support Ngā whānau Māori o te Tari Taake—the whānau from around Aotearoa. You can read more on their work here.

[Becoming a Tiriti based organisation](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/about-us/becoming-a-tiriti-based-organisation)

Over recent years, Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has been working with Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) to understand more about the challenges some customers face when accessing our digital services.

We know that not everyone can or will interact with us digitally. By working with CAB, along with our networks such as the Diversability Network, we've made improvements to both digital and non-digital services. These include:

*   introducing a priority service to callers using the NZ Relay service for people with hearing or speech impairments
*   improving customer advice when registering for myIR
*   increased registration for our Voice ID service (providing additional access, ease and security for 24/7 self-service over the phone).

Te Tari Taake is a digital first, but not digital only, organisation. We’ll continue to focus on the need to design and keep improving non-digital service channels alongside digital ones.

Our efforts to make tax easier were recognised by a finals placing at the 2022 Plain Language Awards. 

Following customer feedback, we updated our ‘Income tax assessment from Inland Revenue’ letter to make our messaging easier to understand. A customer who received the letter nominated us for the Plain Language Awards.

The customer nominating us said, 'The tone and language in this letter make me feel good about paying my tax. This letter is a real turnaround from previous correspondence with Inland Revenue.'

Dividend stripping assessments upheld on appeal
===============================================

2014 case note – Taxpayer's appeal to High Court on dividend stripping assessments dismissed - company restructure, tax avoidance, shortfall penalties.

Case

Beacham v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayers' appeal of the Taxation Review Authority's ("TRA") decision upholding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner's") assessments was dismissed. The taxpayers admitted that the restructuring of their company ownership was a tax avoidance arrangement but challenged the Commissioner's reconstruction of their income as a "deemed dividend" under s GB 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("ITA 2004"). The imposition of shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position was also upheld.

### Impact of decision

This is the first case in which the Commissioner's reconstruction under the dividend stripping rule in s GB 1(3) of the ITA 2004 has been considered by the High Court. The decision also reconfirms established principles around the wide powers of reconstruction under s GB 1 of the ITA 2004.

### Facts

The taxpayers restructured the ownership of their two companies (Beacham Holdings Ltd ("Holdings") and Beacham Jaguar Ltd ("Jaguar")) by selling their shares in those companies to a holding company, Beacham Group Limited ("Group"). Group was incorporated for that purpose following receipt of tax advice. The taxpayers remained 50/50 shareholders and directors of Group as they had been of Holdings and Jaguar.

Prior to the restructuring, Holdings had retained profits of $1,856,277.19 and Dr Beacham's shareholder current account was overdrawn by approximately $1 million. The purchase price for the shares was $1.84 million and payment for the sale of shares was effected by way of journal entry. Group funded the purchase of the shares with an on-demand interest-free loan from the taxpayers. Following the restructure, Dr Beacham's overdrawn current account in Holdings had been repaid and there was a further $500,000 available to be drawn down in the future. The taxpayers treated the amounts received from the sale of their shares in Holdings to Group as capital.

The taxpayers' income in the 2007 income tax year was assessed by the Commissioner on the basis that:

*   the $1,735,000 received from Group was deemed to be a dividend under s GB 1(3) of the ITA 2004; or alternatively,
*   the amount received would be reconstructed as the taxpayers' income under s GB 1(1) of the ITA 2004.

The Commissioner also imposed shortfall penalties for taking an abusive tax position under s 141D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

While the taxpayers accepted they sold their shares in Holdings to Group as part of a tax avoidance arrangement, the taxpayers argued that there was no need for any reconstruction of their income for the 2007 income tax year and that the Commissioner had exceeded the scope of her powers of reconstruction in so doing. The taxpayers argued that s BG 1 of the ITA voided the arrangements and thereby eliminated any tax benefit. The taxpayers submitted there was no outstanding tax advantage to be counteracted because the current account loans from Holdings remain payable by them for income tax purposes.

### Decision

The appeal was dismissed.

The Court confirmed that s BG 1(1) of the ITA operates to void an arrangement only "as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes" and does not act to void an arrangement as between the parties to an arrangement. Although disregarding some tax avoidance arrangements will be sufficient to negate the tax advantage achieved by a taxpayer, for other arrangements, it may be necessary for the Commissioner to use Part G to counteract a tax advantage obtained from or under a tax avoidance arrangement by using her powers of reconstruction.

The Court found this was a case in which the arrangement being void against the Commissioner did not remove the tax advantage to the taxpayers. In this case the arrangement had the effect of repaying Dr Beacham's overdrawn account in Holdings, leaving the balance of the purchase price for the shares available to be accessed in the future.

#### _Was the reconstruction carried out within the scope of s GB 1(3) or s GB 1(1)?_

The only element of s GB 1(3) of the ITA 2004 that was not admitted was whether it was reasonably open for the Commissioner to form the view that the consideration received by the appellants for the sale of their shares in Holdings was "consideration in substitution for a dividend" which the appellants would have derived or might have been expected to have derived.

The Court found that the purpose and effect of the arrangement was to transfer value from the taxpayers' companies to the taxpayers themselves. Had the value been transferred directly, that consideration would have been a taxable dividend. The Court accepted the Commissioner's submissions that the concept of dividend for tax purposes was broader than that under the company law principles. The taxpayers had received the benefit of the consideration for the shares for no economic cost and after the restructure they still own the shares in Holdings (via Group). Therefore, it was reasonably open for the Commissioner to form the view that the consideration received by the taxpayers for the sale of their shares in Holdings was "consideration in substitution for a dividend" and subject to s GB 1(3) of the ITA.

The alternative basis on which the Commissioner made her assessments under the general reconstruction provision in s GB 1(1) of the ITA was also upheld. Where an arrangement is void under s BG 1 of the ITA and the taxable income of any person is affected by that arrangement, the Commissioner is entitled to adjust the amounts included in calculating the taxpayers' taxable income "in the manner the Commissioner thinks appropriate, so as to counteract any tax advantage obtained … under that arrangement".

#### _Shortfall penalties_

The Court found that the Commissioner's imposition of shortfall penalties under s 141D of the TAA was correct. The Court determined that the arrangement was entered into with the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The taxpayers did not lead any evidence to establish any commercial or other purpose for the restructuring of their companies. Goddard J found it relevant that the taxpayers' tax consultant stated the purpose of the arrangement was "to offset Mr and Mrs Beacham's (G&V) value of the shares against the overdrawn current account in Beacham Holdings Ltd …".

Further features that indicated the dominant purpose of the arrangement was to avoid tax were that:

*   the structure of the arrangement meant there was no real or economic cost incurred by the taxpayers;
*   the taxpayers retained their ownership or control of all the relevant companies;
*   Dr Beacham's overdrawn current account with Holdings was repaid in full; and
*   there were no longer any retained profits in Holdings available to be paid directly to the taxpayers.

Do the statutory time bar provisions apply to shortfall penalties?
==================================================================

QB (Jun 2004) clarifies that the CIR is not time barred from issuing/amending shortfall penalty assessments if there is a 'tax shortfall' by the statute bar date.

We have been asked to consider whether the statute bar provisions apply to shortfall penalties.

**Introduction**

Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), gives the Commissioner authority to make any alterations to an assessment or determination in order to ensure the correctness of that assessment or determination, notwithstanding that the tax already assessed may have been paid. The Commissioner's power to amend assessments for income tax (section 108) and GST (section 108A) is subject to a 4 year time limit. Under the statute bar provisions, when an income tax or GST return is furnished and an assessment has been made based on the return that has been furnished, the Commissioner is then barred from amending that assessment so as to increase the tax after the expiration of 4 years from the end of the income year in which the return is provided in the case of income tax or from the end of the return period in respect of which the return was provided or assessment made for GST.

The issue of whether the statute bar provisions apply to shortfall penalties arises when an assessment of a shortfall penalty is made under section 94A. Under section 94A a shortfall penalty is to be assessed "in the same way" as the tax to which it relates. The issue is whether section 94A means that if the time bar provisions apply to a particular tax type then the time bar provisions also apply to any shortfall penalty imposed on that tax.

**When the substantive tax has not been assessed by statute bar**

It is worth recalling that it will only be possible to impose a shortfall penalty where there is a "tax shortfall".  A "tax shortfall" is the difference between the "taxpayer's tax position" and the "correct tax position" for the return period.  The "taxpayer's tax position" is most commonly going to be what has been returned by a taxpayer in their tax return.  The "correct tax position" is defined in the TAA as meaning the "correct tax position established under one or more tax laws."  Where the operation of section 108 prohibits an increase in the assessment of tax after the statute bar date, and in conjunction with section 109 (which provides that the particulars of an assessment are correct in all respects, except on objection or challenge), then the "correct tax position" will not be greater than the "taxpayer's tax position" and there will be no "tax shortfall".  Therefore, where there is a substantive tax position that the Commissioner considers wrong, but that position cannot be amended due to the statute bar, it is that position that is deemed correct by section 109, so there will be no "tax shortfall" and no ability to impose a shortfall penalty after the statute bar date.

It might be thought, in response to this section 109 argument, that section 94A(3) is relevant.  Section 94A(3) of the TAA provides that the Commissioner may assess a shortfall penalty before or after unpaid tax has been assessed, or has become assessable or payable, or has been paid.  This provides that a shortfall penalty can apply to a matter that has not yet been assessed.  However, the provision appears to apply to shortfalls that are yet to be assessed, but that could be assessed, rather than "shortfalls" than cannot be assessed due to a statute bar of the substantive tax.  Section 94A(3) was enacted to allow the Commissioner to proceed with a shortfall penalty proposal, without having to wait for the substantive matter to be finally resolved.  None of this, however, relates directly to the situation where the substantive tax is statute barred.  In such a case, as discussed above, the Commissioner will not be able to establish a "tax shortfall", based on that definition and its interaction with section 109.

**When the substantive tax has been assessed by statute bar**

If, however, the substantive tax has been assessed prior to the statute bar, the question is whether a shortfall penalty can be imposed beyond the statute bar of that underlying substantive tax.  An analysis of the statute bar provisions, section 94A and the surrounding provisions, shows that:

*   When reading the statute bar provision on its own, where an income tax or GST return has been furnished and an assessment made based on _that_ return, the Commissioner is barred from amending _that_ assessment after the expiration of 4 years. The specific references to income tax and GST and the bar on amending those assessments suggest that the provisions were intended to apply specifically to income tax and GST assessments only.

*   This view is also supported by the wording of section 94A(2), which states that the shortfall penalty is to be assessed separately from the tax itself. Therefore, where an income tax or GST assessment has been made the Commissioner is barred from amending that assessment (income tax or GST) and not from amending the shortfall penalty assessment.

*   Further, under the statute bar provisions the Commissioner is only prevented from amending an "assessment". By virtue of the definition of an "assessment" in section 3(1), an "assessment" has to be an assessment of "tax". The definition of "tax" does not include a "civil penalty". The definition of a "civil penalty" includes a "shortfall penalty". Therefore, as the statute bar provisions only apply to assessments of "tax" they do not apply to assessments of shortfall penalties. That is, such an assessment is not an assessment of "tax".

*   The statutory context of the other (non-income tax and GST) assessment provisions of the TAA (sections 93 - 104) is also relevant.  In particular, for all the other types of tax that are assessed under these provisions of the TAA, there is a provision in the Income Tax Act ("ITA") which deems the particular tax to be treated as income tax for the purposes of the ITA and the TAA (with minor exceptions).  There is, however, no such provision in either the ITA or TAA deeming shortfall penalties to be income tax.  Indeed, the definition of "tax" in section 3(1) of the TAA specifically excludes a "civil penalty", and a "civil penalty" is defined to include a shortfall penalty.  Therefore, it appears that Parliament has made sure the provisions of the TAA (including section 108) apply to different taxes by inserting deeming provisions into the particular regimes of the ITA.  The absence of such an explicit deeming for shortfall penalties, and indeed the contra-indication, suggests that provisions relating to "income tax" (including section 108) were not to apply to a shortfall penalty.

**Conclusion**

For the reasons stated above, it is considered that sections 108 and 108A do not apply to assessments of shortfall penalties. Section 94A does not import the statute bar provisions (section 108 and section 108A) into the assessment of shortfall penalties. The Commissioner is not time barred from issuing an assessment for a shortfall penalty or from amending assessments of shortfall penalties, as long as there is a "tax shortfall" by the statute bar date.

Te ratonga tuhinga Document service
===================================

The document service enables the transmission of electronic documents between a customer, partner or intermediary and Inland Revenue. 

How the document service works
------------------------------

When integrated through our gateway services, the document service can be used to:

*   send us electronic documents
*   view previously submitted electronic documents
*   receive electronic documents that we've sent 
*   remove electronic documents submitted by mistake.

Documents used in this service can include:

*   mail we've generated for communicating with customers
*   documents we've requested from a customer
*   documents a customer voluntarily provides us.

We provide documents in PDF format, while documents provided to us can be in many different file formats including PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, JPG, JPEG, PNG, TIF and ODS.

Please note, the ‘MailType’ is included in the response payload for all letters issued by our new system.

Letters issued under our old system are not available in the Document service API.

The list linked below provides all the current mail type codes and the title of each letter item to assist with identifying what each letter is about.

This reference list only contains letters that publish electronically as these are the only ones available in myIR or in the Document service. There is still a small volume of letters that will always print as paper for various reasons.

In general, letters from our new system are formatted as 2 letters followed by 4 numbers. Older letters issued out of our old system have a different format which is a mix of letters and numbers.

Double Tax Agreement on pensions not discriminatory
===================================================

2010 case note - complaint of possible discrimination on jurisdictional grounds struck out - double tax agreement, pensions, unacceptable tax position.

Case

TRA Decision 7/2010

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority (TRA) struck out the taxpayer's complaint of possible discrimination on jurisdictional grounds, but cancelled the shortfall penalties which had been imposed by the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

There are no implications in terms of the decision on the core tax.

#### _Penalties_

The decision appears to permit reference to the taxpayer's sincerity and subjective considerations in determining whether a tax position is unacceptable (see paragraphs \[76\] and \[95\]). The Commissioner respectfully considers that this is irreconcilable with section 141B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), which expressly provides for an objective approach. However, as the decision also notes that the case was "unusual" and "borderline", it is expected that the decision can be considered restricted to its particular facts and that there will be no implications in terms of the approach taken to determining the acceptability of tax positions. It remains the Commissioner's position that taxpayers' sincerity and their subjective considerations are irrelevant to the acceptability or otherwise of their tax positions.

### Facts

The taxpayer is a British national and a New Zealand (NZ) tax resident. He received pensions from the United Kingdom (UK) in 2003 and 2004. Under the NZ/UK Double Taxation Agreement (DTA), pensions are taxed in the country of residence (NZ in this case), and not at the source (UK in this case). This treatment differs from most of NZ's other DTAs (which tax at source), and differs from the treatment in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) model DTA convention.

The taxpayer did not return the income received from his UK pensions in his 2003 and 2004 tax returns. The taxpayer was subsequently issued with assessments incorporating the UK pension amounts. He was also assessed with shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position.

The taxpayer challenged the assessments, arguing that:

1.  the NZ/UK DTA provides that any difficulties in the application of the DTA will be resolved by mutual agreement between the parties;
2.  because NZ taxes income at higher rates than the UK, the taxpayer was disadvantaged in comparison to recipients of pensions from countries other than the UK, and that disadvantage might be unlawfully discriminatory;
3.  therefore, because of the possibility of unlawful discrimination, there must be some difficulty or doubt in the application of the DTA; and
4.  therefore the Commissioner made a disputable decision in not resolving the difficulty or doubt by mutual agreement under the terms of the DTA.

The taxpayer sought resolution of the "difficulty and doubt" on the application of the treaty, through:

1.  an adequate explanation as to why the treatment is lawful;
2.  the Commissioner agreeing with the UK revenue that the taxpayer's pension be taxed in the UK and not in NZ; or
3.  the Commissioner agreeing to tax the taxpayer's UK pension at the rates of tax applicable in the UK.

In the course of the dispute, attempts were made by the Commissioner to satisfy option a) above, but the taxpayer was not satisfied with the answers provided.

The Commissioner applied to strike out the claim insofar as it related to the assessments on the basis that the TRA does not have jurisdiction to determine the proceedings. The Commissioner argued that resolution of the taxpayer's complaint would require a determination on the discrimination point, an issue that can only be considered by the Human Rights Review Tribunal (HRRT).

The Commissioner accepted that the TRA had jurisdiction to determine whether the shortfall penalties for taking an unacceptable tax position had been correctly imposed.

### Decision

#### _Jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority_

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that it did not have jurisdiction to determine the taxpayer's complaint. The claim was struck out insofar as it related to the tax assessments.

The TRA noted at \[23\] and \[24\] that it does not have jurisdiction to make declarations of inconsistency in terms of the Human Rights Act, it does not have jurisdiction to overturn an assessment on the grounds that the legislative basis for the assessment is discriminatory, and does not have the jurisdiction to direct the Commissioner to enter into bilateral discussions with the UK over the application of the DTA.

The TRA agreed with the Commissioner that the TRA and HRRT are statutory creations and that each operates within defined statutory frameworks:

1.  The resolution of complaints of alleged discrimination is, in the first instance, the task of the Human Rights Commission (HRC).
2.  In the event the HRC is unable to resolve such complaints, they are to be determined by a specialist judicial body, namely the Tribunal.
3.  Where the complaint concerns the interpretation and/or application of an enactment, the only available remedy is a declaration of inconsistency. Acts cannot be defeated or misapplied by reason of such inconsistency.
4.  The TRA's function is to determine challenges to the correctness of assessments made by the Commissioner.
5.  Correctness is not a discretionary matter. The TRA has no dispensing power.

While the claim was struck out for lack of jurisdiction, the TRA noted, obiter, that the assessments appeared to be correct in any case.

### _Shortfall penalties_

The TRA disagreed that the taxpayer had taken an unacceptable tax position, and cancelled the penalties that the Commissioner had assessed, stating:

*   \[95\] I do not find the stance of the disputant in this case to be unacceptable. As I have indicated above, viewed objectively it is understandable that this disputant thinks he is correct on the issues dealt with above. A Court needs to give serious consideration to the matters raised by the disputant in this case. They are not simple issues. I think his arguments are sufficient to support a reasonable expectation for him that he could have succeeded. The factors to be considered under section 141B(7) of the TAA do not alter that view of mine. Although it is a little difficult for the disputant to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct, this unusual case can be regarded as borderline and enabling a robust approach to the issue of shortfall penalties.

Ngā whakaaetanga tāke taurua (DTA) Double tax agreements (DTAs)
===============================================================

What

A double tax agreement (DTA) is a tax treaty between two countries or territories.

Relief from paying tax twice
----------------------------

DTAs give more relief from double taxation than is available under domestic law.

*   One way DTAs prevent double taxation is by giving one country or territory the right to tax certain income and exempting it in the other state.
*   Another way is allowing tax credits where both countries or territories tax the same income.

DTAs may, for example, be relevant if you're a:

*   non-resident taxpayer in New Zealand and earn income here
*   New Zealand tax resident and earn income in another country or territory
*   tax resident in New Zealand and another country or territory. 

If there is no tax treaty between New Zealand and the other country or territory, the normal domestic rules apply.

Many DTAs are being updated as part of a global effort to combat tax practices that abuse or exploit DTAs to minimise tax in inappropriate ways.

Countries and territories that have a DTA with New Zealand
----------------------------------------------------------

You'll find the DTAs currently in force on our 'Tax Policy' site. 

[Tax treaties (Tax Policy)](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/tax-treaties)

  

DTAs for different countries or territories are not the same. You'll need to check the DTA to be sure how it applies or consult a tax professional.

Work out your tax residency status
----------------------------------

You'll need to know your tax residency status. This will help you understand how New Zealand's tax laws and DTAs apply to you. In New Zealand, you'll either be a:

*   non-resident taxpayer
*   New Zealand tax resident.

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

[Tax residency status for companies](/international-tax/business/tax-residency-status-for-companies)

  

You'll also need to know your overseas tax residency status.

### Tax relief for your situation

Once you work out your tax residency status, you can see how DTAs may affect how certain types of income are taxed. It's also possible to be a tax resident in both New Zealand and another country or territory.

[Dual tax residents and DTAs](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements/dual-tax-residents)

Certificates of residency and tax relief forms
----------------------------------------------

Before granting benefits under a treaty to New Zealand tax residents, some DTA countries or territories require either:

*   certificates of residency
*   tax relief forms.

[Certificates of residency](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements/certificates-of-residency)

[Tax relief forms](/international-tax/double-tax-agreements/tax-relief-forms)

Mutual agreement procedure (MAP)
--------------------------------

All DTAs include the MAP as a low-cost dispute resolution mechanism. The MAP usually only provides for the respective [competent authorities](/api/glossary/item?id={4F03F793-0222-42EF-B689-37A52700D90D})
 to endeavour to resolve the issue. However, some MAP provisions are being supplemented with arbitration provisions to eliminate cases where competent authorities are unable to reach agreement.

Another recent change being increasingly rolled out across DTAs is to allow a taxpayer to raise a MAP case with either competent authority.

Double Taxation Convention With Canada - 1980
=============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Convention With Canada – 1980 from PIB vol 112, Suppl 2 Oct 1981.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No.2, October 1981

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

### Double Taxation Convention With Canada - 1980

### Part I - Introduction and General Summary

A new double taxation convention has been concluded between Canada and New Zealand to replace the 1948 Agreement between the two countries. The text of the new convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1981/86) and is available from Government Bookshops.

The convention came into force on 29 May 1981 with effect in New Zealand for any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1976. In Canada it takes effect for taxation years which commenced on or after 1 January 1976.

### Transitional Provisions

The entry into force article should be noted carefully because it contains transitional provisions which may affect certain taxpayers. The transitional provisions (in paragraph 3(a) of Article 26) enable taxpayers to obtain the benefit of the 1948 Agreement where any specific provision therein provides greater relief from tax than the equivalent provision in the 1980 convention.

In New Zealand the transitional provisions are effective as follows:

(a) Up to 31 March 1981 in respect of withholding tax on income derived by non-residents.

(b) In respect of New Zealand tax on income derived by residents, for any income year commencing before 12 May 1980 which is the date of signature of the convention.

In every case where it is necessary to consider a situation involving an income year commencing prior to 12 May 1980, the transitional provisions must be considered as well as the main substantive provisions of the new convention. For example, the 1948 Agreement contains a Professors and Teachers Article (Article X) but the 1980 convention does not. Therefore a Canadian teacher who arrived in New Zealand on, say, 1 February 1980, to teach at an educational institution for 18 months, would be entitled to the exemption provisions of Article X of the 1948 Agreement from 1 February 1980 until 31 March 1981, but would be subject to tax from 1 April 1981.

**N.B.**The new convention is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention. The notes and commentaries in the OECD booklet "Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and Capital" are therefore useful recourse material in understanding the application of the convention. Care should be taken to identify clearly differences in the text of the convention from that in the Model if using those notes and commentaries as an aid in the interpretation or application of this new convention with Canada.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are residents of either New Zealand or Canada or of both States. In this context the term "persons" includes companies, estates and trusts.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers the income taxes imposed by the Government of Canada and the income tax and excess retention tax imposed by the Government of New Zealand. Paragraph 3 confirms that the New Zealand bonus issue tax is not subject to the convention.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

**"Canada": Paragraph 1(a)(i)**

Canada is defined to include any area outside the territorial waters of Canada which under the laws of Canada is an area within which the rights of Canada may be exercised, eg, seabed, subsoil and their natural resources.

**"New Zealand": Paragraph 1(a)(ii)**

New Zealand is defined to include areas adjacent to the territorial sea of New Zealand being designated areas over which New Zealand has sovereign rights, eg, natural resources of the sea, or of the seabed and subsoil. The definition does not include the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau.

**"Industrial or Commercial Profits": Paragraph 1 (j)**

The primary concept of the definition is that industrial or commercial profits are profits derived from the conduct of a business. As in all double tax conventions the definition is most important because under Article 7 such profits will be exempt in the country of origin unless the recipient has a permanent establishment in that country.

**"National": Paragraph 1(k)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and   (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 18 Government Service. In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen. In Canada the term covers any individual who is a Canadian citizen.

**Trustee Receiving Income: Paragraph 2**

If dividends, interest or royalties are subject to tax in the hands of a trustee in his country of residence, the trustee is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the income for the purposes of claiming any reductions provided by Articles 10,   11 or   12 of the convention from tax in the country of origin.

**Undefined Terms: Paragraph 4**

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

This Article takes positive steps to solve problems that arise when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The terms "resident of New Zealand" and "resident of Canada" are defined in paragraph 1 and will apply wherever used in the convention. The definition of these terms is in the first instance merely a reference to the domestic law of each country. However, where the domestic laws of each country clash so that the taxpayer is a resident of both countries, the tests set out in paragraphs 2 and   3 of Article 4 apply.

Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to solve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country.

Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. These cases will be decided by the competent authorities (defined in Article 3(1)(f) under the mutual agreement procedure (refer Article 22)). Generally, competent authority intervention will not be necessary as residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person, resident in New Zealand (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "resident of Canada" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention to a "resident of Canada". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, the royalty income would be subject to New Zealand income tax and would still qualify for the 15 percent limitation in the convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "include especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

*   A building site or construction, installation or assembly project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than six months.
*   An oil or gas well constitutes a permanent establishment.
*   An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than six months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project.
*   The term "permanent establishment" includes the use or installation of substantial equipment or machinery for more than six months, eg, an oil rig or a tunnelling machine.
*   An enterprise manufacturing or processing goods, or performing mining or other operations connected with exploiting natural resources, constitutes a permanent establishment of another enterprise if the work is done on the latter's behalf. For example a New Zealand company manufacturing goods in New Zealand on behalf of a Canadian company would constitute a permanent establishment of the Canadian company.
*   An agent constitutes a permanent establishment of his principal if he habitually exercises an authority to conclude contracts. However, an independent agent is generally excluded.

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc.

The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides an extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

Paragraph 1 of the Protocol defines the term "right", for the purposes of this Article, as any right, licence, permit, authority, title, option, privilege, or other concession, and includes a share or interest in any right, licence, permit, authority, title, option, privilege, or other concession.

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of another Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists, the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment. It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax. For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

Paragraph 4 concerns the determination of profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment if the information available to the taxation authority for such determination is inadequate. Where there is inadequate information the paragraph allows the taxation authorities of each State to apply its domestic law in determining the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment, whether by the exercise of a discretion or making an estimate, provided the arm's-length principle is adhered to.

Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

Under paragraph 6, income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(i) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the operator. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer to paragraph (3) below).

Under paragraph 2 both countries are able to preserve the right to tax coastal shipping. Therefore, profits derived from the carriage of passengers or cargo taken on board at one place in a respective country for discharge at another place in the same country may be taxed in that country as profits from internal traffic.

Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ships or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis except when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the country of the recipient's residence.

Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. New Zealand's domestic law is not, therefore, restricted as our withholding tax rate is, at the date of this supplement, 15 percent of the gross dividend. However, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1980 amended the New Zealand domestic law by increasing the withholding tax rate to 30 percent of the gross dividend as from 1 April 1982. Therefore, in terms of the convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law will be 30 percent. The Canadian tax is, however, reduced from a 25 percent domestic rate to 15 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation will be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by the companies paying the dividends to residents of Canada.

Paragraph 3 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect, this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article. The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected. As at the date of this supplement, these qualifications have no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provides for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

Paragraph 4 rules out the extra-territorial taxation of dividends, ie, the practice by which some countries tax dividends distributed by a non-resident company solely because the corporate profits from which the distributions are made, originated in their territory (for example, realised through a permanent establishment situated therein). Article 10 deals only with dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other State. Certain countries, however, tax not only dividends paid by companies resident therein - but even distributions by non-resident companies of profits arising within the territory of those countries. At present neither Canada nor New Zealand taxes such distributions under their domestic laws. Paragraph 4 is inserted in case there is any change to the status quo in either country.

Under its domestic law Canada is able to impose a 25 percent branch tax on undistributed profits of a non-resident company with a permanent establishment in Canada. This branch tax is similar to the New Zealand additional 5 percent tax on non-resident companies. Paragraph 5 limits to 15 percent the tax that Canada may impose on a New Zealand resident company with a permanent establishment in Canada.

### Article 11 - Interest

Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to a maximum of 15 percent in all cases.

Paragraph 3 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid, forms part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from the 15 percent limitation under the Article. The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected. These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

Paragraph 4 is a source rule and precludes arguments as to the source of the interest. The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan has been contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or fixed base.

Paragraph 5 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. New Zealand's domestic law is therefore restricted to 15 percent in all cases. The important results of this are as follows:

*   The exemption of copyright royalties (cultural royalties) contained in the 1948 Agreement is now removed. This removal was not effective in practice until 1 April 1981 because, under paragraph 3 of the Entry into Force Article, taxpayers will have had an option in the interim to claim the benefit of the 1948 Agreement and it is assumed taxpayers will do this.
*   Industrial royalties and know-how payments will no longer be subject to an end-of-year assessment under New Zealand domestic law. The 15 percent tax will therefore be the final New Zealand liability. Consequently, recipients will not be concerned with claiming expenses on an actual basis or on the arbitrary basis allowed by the Commissioner.

Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the definition as they are governed by Article 6. It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis but the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the convention, then the 15 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 15 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the convention to bring the tax down to 15 percent of gross.

Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source, royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided the knowledge, information, assistance, right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 15 percent limitation under the Article. The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the knowledge, information, assistance, right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected. These qualifications tie in with New Zealand's domestic law except that our domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000 and minimum final in all other cases.

Paragraphs 5 and   6. The comments relating to paragraphs 4 and   5 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the sale or disposition of:

*   real property;
*   shares in a company whose assets consist wholly or principally of real property;
*   mining rights and other rights relating to natural resources;
*   shares in a company whose assets consist wholly or principally of such rights.

The term "right" is defined in paragraph 1 of the Protocol as any right, licence, permit, authority, title, option, privilege, or other concession, and includes a share or interest in any right, licence, permit, authority, title, option, privilege, or other concession. Income or gains from such sale or disposition may be taxed in the State where the property is situated.

Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performance of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

### Article 14 - Personal Services

This Article deals with income derived under two different situations:

*   Income from professional (or independent) personal services.
*   Income from dependent personal services (employment income).

Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in the other Contracting State only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State. When read in conjunction with the Credit Article (Article 21) this means that the country where the services are performed has the right to tax the income earned from the performance of those services and the country of residence is obliged to give credit for any tax so charged.

Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The requirements are that the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year, that the remuneration or income is paid by a non-resident and is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the non-resident has in that State. Income from professional services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless attributable to a fixed base in the other State. The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer. In relation to employment income, when a visitor from Canada undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded on departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Canadian tax authorities which certifies that the person is a resident of Canada for the purposes of Canadian tax.

Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of Canada then Canada has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Canadian tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 15 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident, to have the right to such income and the country of residence is obliged to give credit for any tax so charged.

### Article 16 - Entertainers and Athletes

Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services, to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid to the entertainer or athlete himself, but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph allows the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. However, if the enterprise is substantially subsidised out of public funds for the purpose of the entertainment activities or is a non-profit organisation, the country of residence of the enterprise may tax, under its domestic law, the income derived from the performance by the entertainer or athlete. In this case the country where the services are performed does not tax the income derived therefrom. Without paragraph 2 the State where the services are being performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal services income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment, the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 17 - Pensions

In reading this Article it should be noted that, under paragraph 3 of the Protocol, pensions paid by the New Zealand Government to any individual in respect of services rendered to that Government are taxed exclusively in New Zealand.

Subject to paragraph 3 of the Protocol, pensions and annuities are taxed exclusively in the country of residence unless the amount of the pension or annuity exceeds $10,000 in any one year in which case the country of source also has the right to tax.

Where the amount of the pension exceeds $10,000 per year, the tax chargeable in the country of source is the lesser of:

*   15 percent of the gross amount of the pension, or
*   the amount of tax that would have been payable on the gross pension by the recipient, at a rate determined as if he was resident in the country of source.

Where the amount of annuities exceeds $10,000 per year the tax chargeable in the country of source is 15 percent of the gross annuities. However, the 15 percent limitation does not apply to annuities in excess of $10,000 per year received under an income-averaging annuity contract. Such income continues to be taxed in Canada at the rates applicable under domestic law. An "income-averaging annuity contract" is a method used by taxpayers in Canada for spreading forward certain unusual lump sum amounts of income received in a single year. It is similar to a purchased annuity and the annuity payments are assessable for tax in Canada when paid to the recipient.

When the pensions or annuities are taxed in the country of source, credit will have to be given by the country of residence.

### Article 18 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or a local authority thereof.

Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration received by Government servants is generally to be taxed only in the country paying the remuneration, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.
*   The second situation can be illustrated as follows:
    *   Remuneration paid by the Canadian Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national (citizen) of New Zealand, became a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services to the Canadian Government.

### Article 19 - Students

Students or business apprentices visiting a Contracting State for the purpose of education or training are exempt from tax on payments they receive from overseas for their maintenance, education or training. In the case of a Canadian student visiting New Zealand, note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Canada immediately before coming to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, maintenance, education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand. There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice visiting Canada.

### Article 20 - Other Income

This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in other Articles of the convention. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Canada and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights as to the third country income are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident for the purposes of the convention.

Paragraph 1 gives the country of residence the right to tax the income.

Paragraph 2 also allows the country of source to tax such income in which case the normal credit provisions of Article 21 will apply with the country of residence having to give credit for tax deducted in the country of source.

In paragraph 3 the Canadian tax on such income derived by a New Zealand resident from an estate or trust resident in Canada is limited to a maximum of 15 percent provided that income is subject to New Zealand tax. Again the credit provisions would apply.

Paragraph 4 emphasises that income from insurance business is to be taxed according to the domestic law of either country as appropriate.

### Article 21 - Elimination of Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules; each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

Paragraph 3 is a source rule for the purposes of the Article to facilitate the allowance of a tax credit.

### Article 22 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 23 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles.

### Article 24 - Diplomatic and Consular Officials

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic and consular officers shall, under the convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or special international agreements. Paragraph 2 establishes that the sending State is to be the State of residence for members of diplomatic or consular missions provided they are regarded as resident under the domestic law of that State.

Subject to the domestic law residence test, diplomatic or consular officers attached to the Canadian High Commission in New Zealand are regarded as residents of Canada while New Zealand diplomatic or consular officers attached to the New Zealand High Commission in Canada are regarded as New Zealand residents and consequently taxed in New Zealand on their world-wide income.

However, income derived by Canadian diplomats or consular officers from property or investments in New Zealand has a source here and is therefore subject to tax under New Zealand domestic law.

### Article 25 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article.

### Article 26 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the convention will generally take effect in New Zealand for any income year which commenced on or after 1 April 1976 and in Canada for any taxation year which commenced on or after 1 January 1976.

Paragraph 3 gives taxpayers the option for any of the financial years commencing before the date of signature of the convention to take the benefit of the provisions of the 1948 Agreement if more favourable to the taxpayer than the new convention. As already stated the exemption of copyright royalties contained in the 1948 Agreement will not, therefore, be effectively removed until the financial year commencing 1 April 1981. There could also be other instances where the 1948 Agreement is more favourable than the new convention in which case paragraph 3 would be applied.

### Article 27 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol forms an integral part of the convention containing additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the Convention.

Paragraph 1 defines the term "right" for the purposes of Articles 6 and   13.

Paragraph 2 refers to the possible inclusion in the convention of a non-discrimination article should New Zealand include such an article in any other convention.

Paragraph 3 is an additional provision for the purposes of Article 17, stating that pensions paid by the Government of New Zealand in respect of services rendered to that Government are taxed only in New Zealand.
