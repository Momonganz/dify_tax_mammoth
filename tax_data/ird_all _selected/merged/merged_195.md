1 PAYMENTS UNDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1993 FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS - ASSESSABILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 as amended by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3, and the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • The payment of an award of damages to a complainant or aggrieved person for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part II of that Act by the Complaints Review Tribunal where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship; or • The making of a payment to a complainant or aggrieved person for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the complainant’s rights to damages under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part II of that Act where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Payments for damages awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not “monetary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments do not form part of the gross income of the employee under section CH 3. • Such payments for damages are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CD 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2001. 2 This Ruling is signed by me on the 10th day of March 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/2 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2(“the Ruling”). Background Public Ruling BR Pub 97/3 on compensation payments made under the Employment Contracts Act 1991 for humiliation, loss of dignity and injury to feelings was published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No. 3 (March 1997). BR Pub 97/3 concluded that such payments did not form part of the gross income of the taxpayer. The Commissioner has been asked to make a ruling on similar payments made under the Human Rights Act 1993. Under the Human Rights Act 1993 people can make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) regarding breaches of that Act. If the Commission is unable to settle the complaint, the matter may proceed to the Complaints Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). The Human Rights Act provides protection for people in areas of public life against discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, religious or ethical belief, race, colour, ethnic or national origins, age, disability, political opinion, employment status, family status, and sexual orientation. The Tribunal is an independent body that hears and determines complaints that have been made to the Human Rights Commission, the Race Relations Office, the Privacy Commissioner, and the Health and Disability Commissioner which have been unable to be resolved. The Tribunal has the power of a court similar to the District Court, and its decisions can be enforced in the District Court if parties fail to comply with its orders or directions. Legislation Section 86(1) and (2) of the Human Rights Act provides a number of remedies for the Tribunal when the Tribunal determines that a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of the Human Rights Act has been committed: (1) In any proceedings before the Complaints Review Tribunal brought by the Proceedings Commissioner or the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person, the plaintiff may seek such of the remedies described in subsection (2) of this section, as he or she thinks fit. (2) If in any such proceedings the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act, it may grant one or more of the following remedies: (a) A declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of this Act: (b) An order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order: 4 (c) Damages in accordance with section 88 of this Act: (d) An order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach: (e) A declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act is an illegal contract: (f) Relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties: (g) Such other relief as the Tribunal thinks fit. Section 88(1) of the Human Rights Act provides the circumstances in which damages may be awarded under the Act, including damages’ payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings: In any proceedings under sections 83(1) or section 83(4) of this Act, the Tribunal may award damages against the defendant for a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act in respect of any one or more of the following: (a) Pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction of activity out of which the breach arose: (b) Loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach: (c) Humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person. Part II of the Human Rights Act sets out what constitutes “unlawful discrimination” under that Act. Section 21 sets out the general prohibited grounds of discrimination, and sections 22 to 74 go on to deal with discrimination in specific situations. The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 states: "Monetary remuneration" ...means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings, under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 were “monetary remuneration”, they would be included 5 under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 6, and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” to include any “other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer...”. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. While many of the categories of discrimination in Part II may relate, directly or indirectly, to an employer/employee relationship, it is clear that many of them are intended to apply to much wider situations. Consequently, in many instances of complaints under the Human Rights Act, payments awarded will be completely outside any employment relationship and will clearly not be “in respect of or in relation to employment”. In such cases payments under section 88(1)(c) will not fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” and will not be included in the gross income of the taxpayer under section CH 3. The Ruling does not consider such situations. However, it is likely that complaints heard by the Tribunal under the Human Rights Act often will involve an employee/employer relationship. The question to be answered in the Ruling, therefore, is whether payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 where the complaint involves an employee/employer relationship are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The Court of Appeal has endorsed a very wide meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. In Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, where lump sum payments had been made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell, the Court discussed the relevant part of the definition of “monetary remuneration”. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employee relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts, but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. 6 Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553- 554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. 7 Not all payments to employees that have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at page 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691 the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. In the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. 8 In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income- producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. The nature and context of the payments Under section 88 of the Human Rights Act, damages may be awarded by the Tribunal for a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of that Act. As discussed above, breaches of Part II will not necessarily be in an employee/employer situation. If a claim is brought in the Tribunal which does not involve an employee and employer relationship it is clear that payment under section 88(1)(c) cannot be described as monetary remuneration. Where the complaint brought before the Tribunal does occur in the context of an employee/employer relationship, the connection of the employment relationship with payments under the Human Rights Act is tenuous. The Human Rights Act is not “employment legislation”, although it may often operate in the employment context. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. Rather the payments would be in the nature of reparation for a wrong done to the complainant and so would not be in respect of employment. Payments of damages awards under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: 9 It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. The Commissioner considers payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. If a complaint is brought in the Tribunal which involves an employee and an employer, the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the damages payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. Income under ordinary concepts Payments for damages made under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of cases have identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. It is clear that payments under section 88(1)(c) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. Capital receipts do not form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. And by analogy with common law damages, damages payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are of a capital nature as Barber DJ acknowledged in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements The Commission endeavours to settle disputes between parties and sometimes, the parties negotiate a settlement before the dispute is referred to the Tribunal. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the complainant or aggrieved person surrendering his or her rights under the Human Rights Act, the other party will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Tribunal. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the complainant or aggrieved person whether the Tribunal is involved or not. Shams 10 The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\]1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that, in the recent Taxation Review Authority decision, Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Further, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer.
1 YEAR 2000 EXPENDITURE – INCOME TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/4 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section BD 2 and subpart EG of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring of expenditure by a taxpayer to diagnose, correct, and/or test computer software that is potentially affected by the “Year 2000 problem” in respect of that Year 2000 problem, when the software is used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. (The “Year 2000 problem” is also known as the “millennium bug” or as “Y2K”.) The problem is the inability of certain computer software to correctly perform some or all of its functions in respect of dates after 31 December 1999, due to problems with recognising the last two digits of such years. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in diagnosing whether software is affected by the Year 2000 problem is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b); • Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in training staff in the new four-digit programming methods required as a result of the Year 2000 problem is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b); • Notwithstanding section BD 2(1)(b), expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in correcting and/or testing computer software (including embedded software) affected by the Year 2000 problem is not an allowable deduction because it is expenditure of a capital nature under section BD 2(2)(e). Instead, such expenditure must be capitalised and depreciated by the taxpayer, and the depreciation allowance will be an allowable deduction pursuant to section BD 2(1)(a) and subpart EG; • Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in correcting and/or testing computer software affected by the Year 2000 problem, in circumstances where the software was originally Year 2000 compliant but was previously erroneously modified so as to become non-compliant, is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b); and 2 • Expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in correcting and/or testing computer software affected by the Year 2000 problem, in circumstances where the taxpayer holds the software as trading stock, is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b) when the expenditure is incurred. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 November 1998 to 31 October 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of October 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/4 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/4 (“the Ruling”). Background The so-called “Year 2000 problem” is also known as “the millennium bug” or “Y2K”. The problem relates to the way dates are stored in computer software programs. In the 1950s and 1960s, when some of the code of many current software programs was being written, the cost of mainframe storage was prohibitively high. In an attempt to save costs, the year element of a date was stored by the last two digits of the year, rather than by using all four digits. This was considered a sensible use of resources, as at the time there was a significant period until the turn of the century (at which time the two digit standard would begin to cause problems) and many programmers would not have imagined that code written in the 1960s would still be part of computer software programs in the late 1990s. However, the code written in the 1960s has often survived to the present day, either because the program is still operating or because the code has been “patched” into new programs. In the late 1990s the cost of storing all four digits of a year is insignificant, and new programs being coded do not need to adopt the same approach. However, at the time the software was originally written it was a sensible business decision to specify the year by using only two digits. The problem with the changeover from the year 1999 to 2000 is that a computer may have difficulty making the logical jump that a human can in interpreting the two digits “00” as meaning the year 2000, when they come after the two digits “99” meaning the year 1999. Instead, it is most likely that the computer will consider that the year has switched over to another date such as 1900 or, for some systems, 1980. This has widespread implications, and a consensus appears to have been arrived at that the negative implications of this are very far-reaching. The costs of making an existing non-compliant program compliant may be considerable. The costs may be significant because of the difficulty in identifying where each date field appears in the program (which program may be significantly “patched” or have poor programming records). It is possible that taxpayers will not be able to rewrite existing programs and will instead require new hardware and software, and will replace old hardware and software in doing so. Such purchases are generally on capital account and can not be deducted as expenses, but must be capitalised and depreciated instead. However, in the Ruling the focus is on the modification of existing software to work on existing hardware. The costs in making a program Year 2000 compliant come from: • Doing remedial work; • Testing the remedial changes; and 4 • Training and supervising programmers to ensure that they follow the new dates’ standards. The actual extra storage costs of making software programs year 2000 compliant are not significant. For the purposes of the Ruling and this commentary “computer software” includes embedded software, that is software embedded in, and integral to, the operation of other assets. Examples of such embedded software include the software that operates lifts or air-conditioning units in buildings. The general tax treatment of computer software was dealt with in May 1993 when the Commissioner issued a policy statement on the appropriate tax treatment of computer software (Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software Appendix to TIB Volume Four, No. 10 (May 1993)). To the extent the Ruling and this commentary are inconsistent with that policy statement, the Ruling and commentary supersede that policy statement. Classification of Year 2000 problem A key issue in respect of Year 2000 expenditure and the Year 2000 problem is whether the problem is a bug in the program, or whether it is an inherent limitation in the existing life of the program. This is important because it is generally assumed that expenditure on the removal of a bug from a computer software program is on revenue account. The Year 2000 problem is an inherent limitation on the existing life of the program, rather than a bug in the program. When a program has been produced so that it will only last until the end of 1999, this is not properly to be regarded as a bug because, all other things being equal, the program will operate effectively until that time. At the end of the period, when the program ceases to operate (or at least ceases to operate as it should) it has served the purpose it was programmed for, even if the purchaser or user did not expect it to cease operation so early. This is also not a programming error, as the programming decision to store date fields in this way was a deliberate practice to minimise the storage requirements of date fields. A similar point is made in the Government Administration Committee’s report The Y2K Inquiry: Inquiry into the year 2000 date coding problem (April 1998). At page 5 the report states: The Y2K problem has been referred to continuously in the media by such inappropriate terms as the “Millennium Bug” or the “Year 2000 bug”. It is time to debunk this characterisation of the problem. The Y2K problem is not a “bug”. A bug indicates a foreign body invading the systems of its host. The Y2K problem was a design choice included as an integral part of a system. Organisations need to view the problem as a deliberate design choice that now requires correction and not as an infection by an outside agent. The Y2K problem is a product quality problem rather than an unforeseen one. (Emphasis added.) It is important to note that the interpretative view taken in the Ruling (and this commentary) does not implicitly assume that programs were consciously designed to 5 only last until the year 2000 and that purchasers accepted and understood such a limitation. The point is rather that programmers were aware of the limits on the life of their software. Further, factually there is a limit on the life of the software, which may not have been always a conscious programming decision (where programmers just adopted the industry norm without thinking through the implications) nor always consciously accepted by the purchaser. There is also not an implicit assumption that Year 2000 expenditure leads to the creation of a new asset. It is accepted that the old asset continues to exist. However, as a result of the Year 2000 expenditure the asset now (as a matter of fact) has an increased lifespan. It may also be suggested that the appropriate approach is to consider deductibility from the perspective of the taxpayer incurring the expenditure. However, the better view of the law is that a person’s mistaken belief as to the expected lifespan of computer software is not a basis on which to allow deductibility of Year 2000 expenditure. In allowing deductions, the focus is on an objective classification of the expenditure and what it achieves. So what is relevant is whether objectively the expenditure effects an increase in the lifespan of computer software, beyond what it was objectively originally designed to do. The honest, but mistaken, view of the purchaser is not determinative. Support for this objective view comes from cases such as Buckley & Young v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271 (CA) where Richardson J noted in discussing the equivalent of section BD 2(1)(b) that determining deductibility under the general provisions requires determining the true character of the payment. This suggests an objective inquiry as to what the payment achieves. There is of course a subjective element in determining deductibility as well. As Barber DJ said in Case K75 (1988) 10 NZTC 602, 608: I consider that I must apply a mixed subjective and objective test, and it is not sufficient for me to be satisfied that from the subjective view point of the objector the expenditure was necessary in the business interests of the objector. A company must be entitled to decide whether certain expenditure is “bona fide” in the interests of its business; but whether that expenditure is intrinsically of a business or private character requires some objectivity. My determination here would not alter if I were to apply an objective test only. Legislation Section BD 2(1) provides the primary test for deductibility of expenditure: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a) if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer's gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer's gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). 6 Section BD 2(2)(e) provides certain prohibitions on expenditure: (2) An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is ... (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or Section EG 1(1) provides for deductions on account of depreciation: Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year. Section OB 1 defines “depreciable property” and “depreciable intangible property”: “Depreciable property”, in relation to any taxpayer, - (a) Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons - (i) In deriving gross income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; but (b) Does not include - (i) Trading stock of the taxpayer: (ii) Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in Schedule 16): (iii) Financial arrangements: (iv) Intangible property other than depreciable intangible property: (v) Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section EG 16: (vi) Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: (vii) Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive compensation for any decline in value on disposition of that property: (viii) Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): “Depreciable intangible property” means intangible property of a type listed in Schedule 17, which Schedule describes intangible property that has - (a) A finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition; and (b) If made depreciable, a low risk of being used in tax avoidance schemes: Schedule 17 lists the types of depreciable intangible property caught by the definition in section OB 1: · Depreciable Intangible Property 1. The right to use a copyright. 7 2. The right to use a design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right. 3. A patent or the right to use a patent. 4. The right to use land. 5. The right to use plant or machinery. 6. The copyright in software, the right to use the copyright in software, or the right to use software. 7. The right to use a trademark. 8. Management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989. 9. A consent granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 to do something that otherwise would contravene sections 12 to 15 of that Act (other than a consent for a reclamation), being a consent granted in or after the 1996-97 income year. Application of the Legislation In applying the legislation to expenditure incurred in respect of the Year 2000 problem there are four useful sources of guidance: • General case law on the capital/revenue distinction; • General case law dealing with the distinction between repairs and maintenance, and capital improvements to assets; • International accounting treatment of Year 2000 expenditure; and • Other revenue authorities’ pronouncements on the tax treatment of Year 2000 expenditure. As well as these sources of guidance, this commentary also considers various Revenue authority publications on analogous matters. Capital/revenue distinction One of the leading New Zealand cases dealing with the capital/revenue distinction is the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5233. The facts of the case are not important in the context of Year 2000 expenditure, but the comments of the five member Court of Appeal (delivered by Richardson J) are important for the approach they take in deciding whether an amount is expenditure of a capital or revenue nature. At page 5235 the Court said: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and agree. That answer: ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process’. 8 per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” Amongst the factors weighed by the judicial committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. The Court in McKenzies noted that the Privy Council decision in BP Australia was recognised by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v LD Nathan and Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209 and also in Buckley and Young Limited v CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485. The principles from BP Australia which Richardson J summarised in McKenzies, were adopted by Gallen J in Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. The application of those principles is well illustrated by both BP Australia and Christchurch Press. In BP Australia the taxpayer company was a petrol wholesaler. In 1951 its existing method of selling petrol through independent petrol retailers was thrown into turmoil when Shell Australia began “tying” retailers to exclusive deals to sell Shell products. This led to a dramatic decline in retail outlets for BP. To ensure that it had a retail distribution network, BP Australia began paying trade-ties to petrol retailers so that those retailers would deal exclusively in BP’s products for a fixed period of time. The question was whether such expenditure was on revenue account or capital account. In Christchurch Press the taxpayer was a newspaper publisher. It employed electricians and fitters and turners to service and maintain the company’s printing presses and other machinery used in producing the newspaper. In 1985 the taxpayer purchased a sixth unit and a half deck (the meaning of which terms was not explained in the case) to increase and enhance the printing capacity of the press. Some of the electricians and engineers were employed to install and wire up the new equipment. In the same year the taxpayer carried out a replacement of the electrical wiring in its premises, using its own staff to carry out that work. The Commissioner denied deductions for wages paid to such staff while undertaking both projects. Different types of expenditure In applying the case law to Year 2000 expenditure the Ruling distinguishes between diagnosis work, correcting and testing work, and training expenditure. In terms of the Commissioner’s policy statement on computer software these categories are analogous to pre-development, development, and post-development work for taxpayers who acquire, commission, or develop software for their own use (see section 1 of the policy statement). 9 The following discussion relates to Year 2000 expenditure incurred on correcting and testing software. A discussion of the case law as it applies to expenditure incurred on diagnosis and training follows. 10 The need or occasion which called for the expenditure In BP Australia the need or occasion which called for the expenditure was a structural change in the way that petrol retailers did business. In particular, there was a change from independent retailers that sold petrol towards tied service stations. In looking at this factor, the Court said that the need or occasion for the expenditure came from the fact that marketing in the petrol trade in 1951 changed its nature suddenly but for sound commercial reasons. The change was in accord with “modern tendencies in commerce”, with the petrol supply trade changing from a short-term trade to a long- term trade. Part of the change meant that orders for BP’s petrol would only in future be obtainable from tied retailers, and as a result it must obtain such ties with potential retailers. The object of this expenditure was not to achieve the tie but to achieve the orders that would flow from the tie. At page 8 of the Australian Tax Decisions report ((1965) 14 ATD 1) the Privy Council said: To obtain ties it \[BP\] had to satisfy the appetite of the retailers by paying out sums for a period of years, whose amount was dependent on the estimated value of the retailer as a customer and the length of that period. The payment of such sums became part of the regular conduct of the business. It became one of the current necessities of the trade. This was one of the factors that lead the Court to find that the tie paid was deductible revenue expenditure. In Christchurch Press the expenditure involved was the installation of a new unit in the taxpayer’s printing presses. The Commissioner sought to deny deductions to the company for wages of staff involved in installing the units, considering that the better view was that the amount should be capitalised to the cost of the unit and later depreciated. Counsel for the taxpayer sought to argue that the need or occasion behind the expenditure was the contracts of service under which the taxpayer had employed the workers. However, the Court found that the principal purpose of the labour for which wages were paid was the installation of a capital asset (page 10,210). Accordingly, the factor supported categorisation of the expenditure as of a capital nature. Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure would seem to be more closely analogous to Christchurch Press than BP Australia. The need or occasion which calls for the expenditure is the arrival of the year 2000, and the potential risks to the taxpayer’s computer system as a result of that date. Rather than being a normal expense incurred in the earning by the taxpayer of income as in BP Australia, the expenditure is of a one-off nature incurred to ensure that computer systems continue to operate after the year 2000. It is probably even less recurrent than Christchurch Press, where presumably a new unit was required every now and then. Were the payments made from fixed or circulating capital? In BP Australia the Privy Council considered that the test of whether sums were payable out of fixed or circulating capital tended in that case to favour the payments as revenue expenditure. The members of the Judicial Committee said (14 ATD 1, 8) that fixed capital is that on which a taxpayer looks to get a return by its trading 11 operation, and circulating capital is that which comes back in the taxpayer’s trading operations. Their Lordships considered that the amounts paid by BP to a service station owner were sums which had to come back penny by penny with every order during the period in order to reimburse and justify the particular outlay for the tie. They concluded that the lump sums were part of the consistent demand that must be answered out of the returns of the trade. As such, the Privy Council found that the sums were payable out of circulating capital. In Christchurch Press the Court considered the tests in terms of whether the expenditure could properly be described as pertaining to fixed or circulating capital. At page 10,210 Gallen J concluded that the expenditure pertained to fixed capital, as it was as much a part of the capital asset as it would have been if the appellant had paid a contractor to effect the installation in either case. He said that if a contractor had been so paid, it could not have been said that the payment was not a capital payment. The way the test was used in Christchurch Press is different to the way it was used in BP Australia. In Christchurch Press the focus was on the end product of the expenditure, while in BP Australia the focus was on the source of the funds to pay for the expenditure. For Year 2000 correcting and testing expenditure the payments may be being made from fixed capital, rather than circulating capital. In the words of the Privy Council in BP Australia, the sums paid do not come back in the taxpayer’s trading operations; instead they are amounts on which the taxpayer seeks to get a return in its trading operations. In terms of the formulation of the test in Christchurch Press, the payment gives rise to a new or improved capital asset that becomes part of the fixed capital by which the owner makes a profit. The new or improved capital asset is the year 2000 compliant computer system. It may be that in Christchurch Press the test was not readily applicable to the facts of the case. It also may be that the test is not as useful as the other tests in determining whether Year 2000 expenditure is capital or revenue. In many cases it will be very easy to switch between financing an asset from circulating capital to financing it from fixed capital, irrespective of the nature of the asset financed. Such easy substitution undermines, to an extent, the usefulness of the test. Were the payments of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit? In BP Australia their Lordships considered that the expenditure in gaining ties with retailers was recurrent, and not of a once and for all nature. They cited Vallambrosa Rubber Co Ltd v Farmer (1910) 5 TC 529 where the Court had said that capital expenditure is a thing that is going to be spent once and for all, and revenue expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year. They saw the expenditure as being made to meet a continuous demand in the trade. These were matters that were connected with the ever-recurring question of marketing and customers. Accordingly, the Lordships appeared to consider that this factor favoured a revenue classification. In terms of whether or not the payments gave rise to an enduring benefit, the 12 Lordships did not appear to make a final decision other than to distinguish a large number of cases put to them by the Commissioner. In Christchurch Press the Court stated that the regular payment of wages did not mean that the expenditure was of a revenue nature. Gallen J said that regular payments will sometimes be payments that relate to the ordinary daily outgoings of a business, but sometimes they may relate to a particular capital expenditure and be coloured by that. He noted that the work for which the workers were paid was done to bring into use the new equipment that was clearly both an asset and one intended to be an enduring benefit. For Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure this factor is probably the strongest factor favouring a capital classification of the expenditure. The payments will tend to be of a once and for all nature as they will only be required to solve the Year 2000 problem and not subsequently. This is so irrespective of the amounts that make up the Year 2000 expenditure. Thus, although there may be regular payments to contractors and employees to deal with the problem (the very nature of the expenditure relates in the main to labour costs), in aggregate those costs are of a once and for all nature. Moreover, the benefit of the Year 2000 expenditure does tend to be an enduring benefit. It enables computer systems that previously would have ceased to operate effectively at 1 January 2000 or earlier to continue in operation for many years thereafter. How the payment is treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting In BP Australia the Privy Council noted that the sums paid to retailers were entered into the profit and loss account by BP’s accountants. The Privy Council considered it would have been inappropriate to put the sums on the balance sheet. However, they accepted it was misleading to put the whole sum into one year’s expenses. They contemplated the idea of deducting the payments and adding back the unexpired value, but concluded that accountants did not follow this practice. Allocation to revenue was the “slightly preferable” view. In Christchurch Press Gallen J noted that there was no evidence on the appropriate accounting treatment of such a payment. However, his Honour referred to a comment of Lord Donovan in IRC v Land Securities Investment Trust Limited \[1969\] 2 All ER 430, 433 (PC) where his Lordship said that where a company used its own employees to build an extension to its factory, the accountant should debit the wages to the capital account relating to the extension. Although the comments of Lord Donovan were criticised by counsel for the taxpayer in Christchurch Press, the Court considered it was at least an indication of what the position was when the case was decided. This is the only factor of the five that favours Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure being expensed. Accounting bodies in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia all favour expensing Year 2000 expenditure, rather than its capitalisation and subsequent depreciation. This is discussed later. 13 Were the payments expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or were they part of the process by which income was earned? In BP Australia the Privy Council considered that the amounts expended by BP on acquiring trade ties were not expended on the business structure of the taxpayer, but were part of the process by which income was earned. This was consistent with the earlier comments of their Lordships that the expenditure was intended to assist BP in achieving orders and selling petrol. In Christchurch Press the Court found that the expenditure was incurred on the business structure of the taxpayer. Gallen J accepted that the expense was intended to improve the production of the newspaper, but that was secondary to the construction of a capital asset which was itself designed to further that end of improving the newspaper. Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure is expenditure designed to enhance the business structure of the business in question, rather than being part of the process by which income is earned. The expenditure is designed to ensure that the structure of the business remains fully functioning after 1 January 2000, and to ensure that the business of earning profits from the use of fixed assets can continue at full efficiency. Given the potential business risks of having key accounting, invoicing, and information systems down until new system could be created, or the old system revised, solving these risks point to a capital classification. Summary The indicative factors discussed above favour classification of Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure as of a capital nature. The key factors favouring this are: • That the need or occasion giving rise to the expenditure is of an unusual and unique nature. • That the expenditure is for once and for all and gives rise to an enduring benefit, namely the prolonged existence of computer systems beyond the year 2000. • The payments are expended to bolster the business structure of the taxpayer. There are two exceptions to this. The first of these is that Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in circumstances where the software was originally Year 2000 compliant but was previously erroneously modified so as to become non-compliant is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b). Such expenditure is deductible on the basis that the expenditure simply restores the objectively determined original lifespan of the software. In such circumstances there is no addition to the asset’s lifespan, instead the previous modifications inadvertently reduced the lifespan. The second exception is that Year 2000 correction and testing expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in circumstances where the taxpayer holds the software as trading stock is an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(b) when the expenditure is incurred. 14 Diagnosis and training expenditure As well as the actual expenditure incurred in making a non-compliant system compliant (the reprogramming work), there is expenditure incurred in diagnosing whether a system has a Year 2000 problem or not, and expenditure in training staff in the new programming standards required as a result of the solution to the Year 2000 problem. In terms of the diagnosis of a Year 2000 problem, it is part of a business’s normal expenditure to investigate whether or not key business systems are in a good state of operation. Many of the business’s computer systems need to be reviewed throughout their lives to ensure that they are performing, and will continue to perform, in the manner required. Occasionally an exterior threat requires the system to be examined. This could be a computer virus, or as with the Year 2000 problem an external date- related problem. Such expenditure meets the basic test of deductibility in section BD 2(1)(b) while not being denied deductibility under section BD 2(2)(e) as expenditure of a capital nature. Such expenditure is the type of expenditure incurred by a prudent business to ensure the on-going viability of its business systems. The five tests for capital expenditure extracted from BP Australia and discussed above suggest that diagnosis expenditure is of a revenue nature. The first factor is the need or occasion that called for the expenditure. Although the Year 2000 is itself a one-off occurrence, businesses must consider the viability of their systems more regularly than at the approach of the year 2000. Consideration of the on-going usefulness of systems is a regular part of a business’s undertaking. The second factor is whether the expenditure is fixed or circulating capital. However, as discussed above this test is less useful than the others given the easy substitution of funding for projects. The third factor is the enduring benefit test. The expenditure incurred in testing a system for Year 2000 compliance does not give rise to an asset or advantage of an enduring benefit. All it does is give the business information and choices that it needs to make in respect of that software. It is what the business does with that information that can give rise to an enduring benefit. However, simply knowing that a system will lose its effectiveness on the arrival of the year 2000 is not an enduring advantage or benefit. The fourth factor is the accounting treatment of the expenditure. As discussed elsewhere in this report, international accounting treatment favours expensing all Year 2000 expenditure. The fifth factor questions whether or not the payment relates to the business structure of a taxpayer or the process by which income was earned. It is difficult to link diagnosis expenditure with the business structure of a taxpayer. While it enables taxpayers to know whether their business structure is at risk, actually finding out that a system is or is not Year 2000 compliant does not add anything to the business structure. 15 As a result of objectively considering each of these five factors, and particularly given that they all favour a revenue classification, diagnosis expenditure will be deductible under section BD 2(1)(b) (assuming the other requirements of the section are met) and will not be prohibited from being an allowable deduction by virtue of section BD 2(2)(e). In practice it may be difficult to draw a line between expenditure on diagnosing a Year 2000 problem, and expenditure on correcting and testing that problem. The type of diagnosis expenditure discussed above relates to that part of the project that determines whether the system being examined will work past the year 2000, but without going into a line by line examination of the software code to discover where the particular problems are. Such expenditure involves diagnosis of whether a system is Year 2000 compliant or not, rather than diagnosis in the sense of a detailed examination of computer code to decide where in the particular program remedial work needs to be undertaken. It is not acceptable to go through code line by line identifying every area where the system needs a change and then describe this as diagnosis expenditure for the purpose of applying the Ruling and claiming the expenditure as deductible. Such work is actually analysing the program to see where and what the problems are, and goes beyond an overview diagnosis to see if there is a problem. The correcting and testing expenditure is that expenditure incurred in determining the required recoding, undertaking that recoding, and testing that recoded program. There will not be a great deal of training expenditure required where Year 2000 expenditure simply allows software to continue with the same functionality it had prior to the expenditure, as the users of the software will not have any new training needs. However, programmers may need to be trained in the new programming standards required as a result of the solution to the Year 2000 problem. Expenditure in training staff on the most appropriate programming methods is considered to be part of a business’s standard training expenditure and is deductible if the other tests in section BD 2(1)(b) are met. Remaining analysis The remainder of this commentary relates to testing and correction expenditure only, because it has already been determined that the other expenditure incurred with respect to the Year 2000 problem (diagnosis and training expenditure) is deductible under section BD 2(1)(b). The remaining analysis considers whether correcting and testing expenditure may be deductible on some other ground, which may not be precluded by the capital/revenue distinction. Repairs and maintenance Inland Revenue’s policy statement on repairs and maintenance, in TIB Volume Five, No. 9 (February 1994) at page 1, was intended to explain the then new depreciation regime, which replaced the previous section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The old section 108 specifically provided for the deduction of amounts spent on repairs 16 and alterations. The new regime did not provide specifically for these deductions. The policy statement made the point that, in practice, what was deductible under the old section 108 and what would be deductible on revenue account under the general provisions of the Act would not differ to any large degree. The only difference anticipated was that alterations that did not increase the value of an asset might be on capital account under the general provisions of the Act, whereas they were deductible under the old section 108. The policy statement provided for the following key principles: • Expenditure on repairs, maintenance, alterations etc., must be on revenue account for it to be deductible. • Capital expenditure is not deductible, but is subject to the normal depreciation rules. • Expenditure required to maintain an asset in the condition it was when the taxpayer acquired it will be on revenue account, and therefore deductible. • The replacement of a capital asset will be capital expenditure. • Expenditure on an asset over and above making good wear and tear will be capital expenditure. These principles were based on case law, subsequently discussed in the policy statement. However, in the context of computer software there is some doubt as to the applicability of much of the case law dealing with repairs and maintenance. For example, the concept of fair wear and tear has no real meaning for computer software, except, possibly, in situations where external events such as computer viruses or power surges affect the operation of a program. While the software may become outdated or ineffective, it is not likely to wear and tear in the way that term is normally used. Repairs and maintenance cases may only be relevant if we were analysing the Year 2000 problem as a computer “virus”, which, as discussed in the Government Administration Committee report quoted above, is not an appropriate analysis. In spite of these reservations some of the principles from repairs and maintenance cases are still useful. In the context of computer software, the best means to apply the principles identified in the repairs and maintenance policy statement is by looking at analogous cases. New Zealand case law In Colonial Motor Company Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 (CA) the taxpayer owned an eight-story building which was considered an earthquake risk. It had to be either demolished or seismically strengthened. The taxpayer chose to do the latter, and undertook the work required. This included adding two concrete walls, and the refurbishment of the interior into office premises. This led to the transformation of the building from a warehouse into an office building with a 50-year economic life. 17 In the High Court (reported at (1994) 16 NZTC 11,060) Ellis J found that the expenditure was of a capital nature and not repairs. Although the work was not the complete replacement of the eight-storey building, it was the transformation of an unsound warehouse building into a sound commercial building with a substantial revenue-earning life. At page 11,063 he emphasised that the subject matter of the work was a building under threat of demolition which became a sound building with a 50-year life ahead of it. This is similar to Year 2000 expenditure where a program under threat of obsolescence is transformed into a programme with a potentially substantial life ahead of it. The Court of Appeal also disallowed any deductions, but focused on the then second proviso to section 108 which allowed a deduction for “alterations” which increased the value of an asset by less than the cost of those alterations. As a result, the decision of the Court of Appeal is of less direct relevance than that of the High Court in terms of the Ruling because of its focus on now-repealed legislation. However, the Court of Appeal agreed with Ellis J that the work undertaken led to a substantial reconstruction and improvement of the original premises. Outside of the then statutory provisions, such a description of expenditure would normally be seen as being on capital account and non-deductible as a repair (see, for example, the Australian cases discussed below dealing with alterations to buildings). Colonial Motor favours classifying Year 2000 expenditure as on capital account. In Sherlaw v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 Doogue J dealt with expenditure incurred in relation to a boat-shed. Repairs were necessary to the slipway and floor of the shed, as well as to the piles of the building. To repile the building the roof needed to be removed so that piles could be placed through the floor. As a result of removing the roof some of it was damaged and had to be replaced because it was incapable of being repaired. The floor was relocated to a slightly higher level to allow for the new piles. At the same time as this work was going on the taxpayer decided to carry out deferred maintenance as well. The work undertaken, which the taxpayer considered to be repairs and maintenance, cost $34,449. The work cost approximately 150% of the value of the property before the work was commenced, and involved repiling, moving the floor, replacing some of the roof, and other deferred maintenance. Notwithstanding the extent of this work, it was found to be repairs or alterations and not capital reconstruction. It was important to his Honour’s decision that much of the materials used in the repair of the premises were second-hand materials or recycled materials from the boat-shed, and that the repairs came about as a result of gradual deterioration in an otherwise sound structure, and thus could be seen as correcting normal wear and tear. His Honour also felt that it was important that at the times the piles were repaired the taxpayer had no intention of undertaking the other work required. His Honour distinguished Colonial Motor on the basis that the boat-shed, after repair, remained a boat-shed of much the same size and layout as before. In Sherlaw Doogue J did say that the work to replace the piles gave rise to a longer lifespan to the boat-shed than would have been the case if the work was not done. However, this is not unique to that fact situation. Almost every amount of 18 expenditure of repairs and maintenance has that effect. The judge also described the expenditure as “necessary maintenance”, which seems to refer to the maintenance that must be done throughout the life of an asset to ensure it lasts at least for the period it is designed for. The facts of Sherlaw are not considered to be analogous to the Year 2000 problem. Sherlaw was a case involving restoration of function, in circumstances where the loss of function was due to wear and tear, in the context of a tangible asset. The Year 2000 problem is a case involving the removal of an inherent date limitation, in the context of an intangible. Auckland Gas Company Limited v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,408 concerned the insertion of polyethylene (“PE”) pipe into the existing Auckland gas reticulation network. Williams J summarised the key facts of the case at page 13,433: • The existing network required costly maintenance and unaccounted for gas (“UFG”) was a problem; • The taxpayer attempted to reduce UFG and maintenance costs prior to the PE pipe insertion program, but no one technique had proved satisfactory; • The problem of UFG had worsened with the introduction of natural gas; • Much of the network had years of life left in it; and • The system needed to be changed to deliver a different product at a different pressure. Although one may have expected these factors, particularly the last, to have led to a capital classification, his Honour found that the expenditure was a repair to the network. At page 13,433, after noting that the PE pipe was almost maintenance free, had a long life, and the problem of UFG almost disappeared when it was inserted, he said: But in this Court’s view, one of the more important aspects of the case is that the longevity of the inserted PE pipes seems unlikely to exceed what would have been the longevity of the cast iron and steel network properly maintained. His Honour noted that prior to the PE insertion program the taxpayer had a network capable of delivering enough gas to satisfy demand, albeit with a high percentage of UFG and a significant requirement for extensive and costly maintenance. After the PE insertion program the taxpayer: ...had a network which was similarly capable of supplying sufficient natural gas at medium pressure to meet demand. It was neither more extensive nor longer lived but had the major advantages of significantly reduced installation costs than trenching, being virtually UFG-free, and having much lower repairs and maintenance costs than the existing network. His Honour concluded the sums paid were on revenue account as a deductible repair. The major factual difference between Auckland Gas and the Year 2000 problem is the finding that the “repairs” did not increase the life of the asset beyond their existing life. This distinguishes Year 2000 expenditure as such expenditure does extend an asset’s useful life, by removing an inherent limitation of the software, and the decision in Auckland Gas is not an impediment to a capital classification of Year 2000 expenditure. 19 The facts in Auckland Gas would normally suggest a capital classification. The expenditure gave rise to an enhanced asset (lower repairs and maintenance costs, lower UFG) with substantially different characteristics to the old asset (smaller diameter, suitable for pumping gas at a higher pressure). Indeed, the gas was travelling through a different asset, the PE pipe rather than the old cast iron mains. (The Auckland Gas decision has been appealed to the Court of Appeal by the Commissioner.) Since the Auckland Gas decision there have been two further High Court cases that suggest some unease with the decision. In Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Limited v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 the taxpayer incurred expenditure in laying electricity cables underground to replace electricity lines that were previously carried above the ground on poles. The taxpayer considered the expenditure was deductible as a repair and did not need to be capitalised as an improvement. The High Court found the expenditure was not a repair, as it was the creation of a new asset with different physical characteristics. The taxpayer attempted to rely on a “functionality” test on the basis that each piece of the network could not function on its own and could not be treated as a separate asset. At page 13,702 Goddard J noted that the functionality test and its kindred “profit earning structure” test have not found favour with the Courts with one exception, and that exception was the decision in Auckland Gas. She favoured identifying each particular job as an asset. Her Honour concluded on the same page that: With respect to Williams J \[the judge in Auckland Gas\], however, it seems the tests he applied are contrary to the approach that has been consistently taken by the Courts. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,779 the facts were substantially similar to the Hawkes Bay Power case, albeit in the context of the Poverty Bay area. At page 13,794 Ellis J noted that he shared Goddard J’s reservations about the decision in Auckland Gas and concluded that the work was of a capital nature. The New Zealand repairs and maintenance cases discussed favour a capital classification of Year 2000 expenditure. Colonial Motor illustrates that expenditure that transforms an asset, including an extension of its lifespan, will be on capital account. Sherlaw involved a restoration of individual components of a boat-shed, without any change of function, to ensure the shed continued to exist for its originally designed lifespan. In circumstances where such necessary maintenance is undertaken, expenditure is more likely to be on revenue account. The decision in Auckland Gas seems to have turned on the Court’s finding that the work undertaken did not increase the lifespan of the system. If the Court had found that the work did increase the lifespan it seems likely that the result would have been that the work was on capital account. The case must be treated with some caution as the facts would normally have suggested a capital classification, and the Courts in Hawkes Bay Power and Poverty Bay Electric Power Board have both questioned the reasoning in the decision. 20 Canadian case law A series of Canadian cases have found that expenses incurred on altering assets because they did not comply with requirements of various government agencies have been non-deductible capital expenditure rather than repairs. These cases are analogous to Year 2000 expenditure, because they focused on a taxpayer being involved in expenditure imposed by an outside requirement that did not necessarily improve the taxpayer’s asset. These cases include Riggs Motor Sales Ltd v MNR (1954) 10 Tax ABC 219 (taxpayer had to remove petrol pumps from the municipal pathway in front of its main premises to comply with Department of Highways order), MNR v Lumor Interests Limited \[1959\] CTC 520 and The Richmond Building of London Limited v MNR (1962) 30 Tax ABC 203 (taxpayers incurred expenditure on upgrading elevators that would otherwise be condemned), and The New Anchor Hotel v MNR \[1976\] CTC 2428 (taxpayer installed a new heating system which removed the risk of the hotel being closed if the old system failed). In New Anchor Hotel the Tax Review Board considered that the new heating system prolonged the life of the hotel and was of a capital nature. Some of these Canadian cases would seem to present a stronger case for deductibility of expenditure than Year 2000 expenditure. In some of the cases the assets in question were working correctly, but external requirements meant they had to be changed to continue operating. Still the courts found the expenditure to be capital. This would have been a stronger case for deductibility than Year 2000 expenditure where there has been no change of external circumstances, but the arrival of a date that was always going to stop the program functioning correctly. A useful decision for showing the distinction between capital expenditure and revenue expenditure in a computer context is Central Amusement Company Limited v Canada \[1992\] 1 CTC 218. The taxpayer owned between 900 and 1,000 video and other arcade games, which it placed in various locations within Canada. The games cost approximately $4,500 each. The games maximised earnings when they were new, but as they became more familiar to their users frequency of play and income declined. For $750 each, the taxpayer was able to replace the circuit boards in the games using conversion kits, thereby creating new games that then satisfied the market for several more months. In 1983 the taxpayer spent $175,026 on the conversion kits which it deducted. The Minister considered that the amount was capital expenditure that should be added to the capital cost of the assets. The Federal Court held that the amount was currently deductible. The Court noted the characteristics of a capital expenditure; it is made once and for all, it offers more than a temporary or passing advantage, and its cost in relation to the cost of the whole asset is usually significant. However, the Court noted that the installation of new circuit boards was done on a continual and recurring basis, the advantage gained from the installations was temporary (usually six to eight months), and the cost of the conversion kits was not a major component in relation to the value of the machines as a whole. 21 Superficially the expenditure in Central Amusement and expenditure for Year 2000 problems are similar. In both cases the expenditure is intended to update and extend the life of assets. However, the similarities are only superficial. The video games that were updated in Central Amusement were updated on a regular basis, with the update having a commercial life of approximately six to eight months after which the income from each machine returned to its pre-replacement levels. (This was for two reasons: first, because the users of the game had learnt to master the new game and could play longer, and second because the users lost interest with the game and stopped playing it.) Thus updates of the games were a regular occurrence. As a result of this the expenditure on updating the video games was not once and for all and did not bring into account an asset of an enduring nature. Really the purpose of the expenditure in Central Amusement was to continue to make use of the physical equipment in which the circuit boards were housed (that is, the game box). It was not the software that was being updated; indeed the old software was dumped for a completely new game. This is quite different to Year 2000 expenditure where it is intended that alterations made to the computer software will be a one-off and will last for a considerable period of time. As a result the factors that were relevant in the Central Amusement case do not apply to Year 2000 expenditure. English case law The fact that Year 2000 expenditure will prolong the useful life of computer software programs suggests that it is more than simple repairs or maintenance, and hence that it is not deductible expenditure. This is supported by the English case of ACT Construction Limited v Customs and Excise Commissioners \[1979\] 2 All ER 691 (QBD); \[1981\] 1 All ER 324 (CA); \[1982\] 1 All ER 84 (HL). The taxpayers carried out work on a number of buildings that had been damaged by subsidence. The original foundations of the buildings did not comply with modern building regulations, and the work of correcting the subsidence could not be carried out merely by repairing or replacing the original foundations. Additional foundations were necessary. As a result the existing foundations were left unaltered. The case was a VAT case and the issue was whether the work carried out was repairs and maintenance and therefore standard-rated or whether the services supplied were those of alteration of a building and therefore zero-rated. At page 695 of the QBD decision the Court said: But where alterations, additions, substitutions, or improvements to a building are made, I think the question must be asked whether the building after the work is done is something substantially different in character from that which it was before ... But where the work is to replace the building which exists with something substantially and significantly different in character it can no longer properly be called repairs or maintenance. The Court considered a number of tests as to whether work has altered the character or nature of the premises so as to favour a capital classification of the work. The Court asked whether the work would: • Substantially alter the life of the building; • Significantly affect its saleability; 22 • Significantly affect its market value; or • Make good a building which had always up to that time been considered defective in the sense that it did not comply with modern building regulations. At page 696 the Court concluded that the character and nature of the premises were altered by the work done, were therefore not repairs and maintenance, and so were zero-rated. In the Court of Appeal, per Brandon LJ, the Court upheld the Queen’s Bench Division’s decision. The work done by the taxpayer was entirely new work, involving a radical and fundamental alteration to the construction of the building. Such work was clearly not capable of being maintenance. In the House of Lords consideration was given both to “repairs” and “maintenance” unlike the Queen’s Bench Division and the Court of Appeal which only considered “maintenance” in any detail. Lord Roskill delivered the judgment of their Lordships and said that “repairs” and “maintenance” may often overlap and are not used in antithesis to one another. At page 88 his Honour said: My Lords, I stress, like Brandon LJ, that this was new work which converted buildings which, apart from this work, would have had a short life into building which, as a consequence of this work, became endowed with a long life. This consequence was achieved only by the instalment of a new structure on which the building thereafter rested ... I am unable to see how this underpinning can possible be classed as “repairs or maintenance” within the ordinary meaning of those words. This case favours classifying Year 2000 expenditure as non-deductible capital expenditure. The tests put forward in the Queen’s Bench Division suggested that expenditure will be capital in nature when it substantially alters the life of an asset or makes good an asset which has always up to that time been considered defective in some way. Both these considerations apply equally to Year 2000 expenditure. Year 2000 expenditure has the functional effect referred to in the tests put forward in ACT Construction. Australian case law In BP Oil (Bulwer Island) Limited v FCT 92 ATC 4031 (Federal Court) one of the issues was whether the taxpayer was entitled to a deduction for the cost of encasing wooden piles in concrete to stop marine organisms from further damaging the piles. The Court refused the deduction saying that neither the piles nor the wharf was repaired. The work was not a repair unless it included some restoration of something that was lost or damaged. The work was an improvement not a repair and therefore was on capital account. The work added something: both the substance by which the piles were encased and the capacity of the submerged parts of the wharf to avoid further damage from the marine organisms. This decision also favours classifying Year 2000 expenditure as on capital account. An item is repaired or maintained if it includes some restoration of something that was lost or damaged. Year 2000 expenditure does not restore something that was lost or damaged. Instead it is more like an improvement. Just as the piles of the wharf in BP Oil were protected from further damage, extending their expected life span, Year 23 2000 expenditure protects a computer software program from not functioning properly and extends its useful working life. But for the Year 2000 expenditure the program would only have worked until the year 2000 as designed, after the Year 2000 expenditure is incurred the program will continue for longer than designed. There was a similar result in Case 55 (1953) 4 CTBR (NS) 298 where after cyclone damage a building was moved back forty feet to avoid further damage. The taxpayer claimed the cost of moving as a deductible expense, but the Tax Board of Review found it was of a capital nature. The Board concluded that the cost of moving must be regarded as strengthening or preserving the business organisation or entity, the capital structure. This case appears similar to the incurring of Year 2000 expenditure. Year 2000 expenditure also involves preserving an asset from damage that may occur in the future. In the case of Year 2000 expenditure the damage would be the collapse or substantial reduction in performance of a taxpayer’s computer systems. The expenditure is incurred to strengthen or preserve the business organisation or entity, or at least part of its capital structure. In Case 121 (1954) 4 CTBR (NS) 732 the taxpayer owned hotels which required rewiring as the existing systems had been condemned and required replacement. The taxpayer claimed the expenditure was deductible. The Tax Board of Review said the expenditure was of a capital nature and non-deductible. This was in spite of evidence that the new system did not improve the hotels or add to their value. The reasons were: • The work done was more than restoration, it provided a lighting system having considerable advantages over the old, including cost advantages; and • The work involved replacement of the old system and not a repair. A similar result on similar facts occurred in Case 39 (1958) 8 CTBR (NS) 189. These cases provide support for Year 2000 expenditure being capitalised. In both cases an external requirement meant that changes to the electric wiring system had to be made. In both cases the new system did not give rise to improved function, or even a more valuable asset. However, the work done was more than a mere repair. Although Year 2000 expenditure does not have the physical aspects of these cases, it shares a similar characteristic that it will often not improve the value of the existing software. However, because software which has been made Year 2000 compliant has considerable advantages over the old software, the principles of the cases can be applied. Again, as for some of the Canadian cases, there would seem to be more of an argument favouring deductibility in the Australian cases, compared to Year 2000 expenditure, yet the tribunals found the amounts were capital. In Case 49 (1971) 17 CTBR (NS) 319 the taxpayer had incurred expenses of approximately $3,000 for repairs to a showroom ceiling. The Board of Review found that the expenditure on the new ceiling was of a capital nature because it overcame substantial defects of the old ceiling, thereby conferring substantial advantages on the asset. Again this case supports the view that Year 2000 expenditure should be on capital account. The alterations to the showroom conferred a substantial advantage on the showroom and overcame substantial defects of the old ceiling. In the same way 24 capital expenditure which corrects the Year 2000 bug confers substantial advantages on the computer software involved by overcoming a substantial defect. Summary The case law discussed above suggests that Year 2000 expenditure is not a deductible repair of an asset, but is a capital expense in relation to a computer program. The key factors from case law which favour the capital classification rather than a repair classification are: • The expenditure will increase the anticipated working life of the computer program. • The expenditure effects the removal of an inherent limitation from the program. • The expenditure does not restore something lost or damaged but improves the program. International accounting treatment of Year 2000 expenditure United States The Emerging Issues Taskforce (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board discussed the issue at a meeting on 18 July 1996. The issue discussed was how to account for the external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal-use computer software for the Year 2000. EITF Abstract 96-14 noted that: The Taskforce reached a consensus that external and internal costs specifically associated with modifying internal-use software for the Year 2000 should be charged to expense as incurred. United Kingdom The Urgent Issues Taskforce (UITF) of the Accounting Standards Board in the UK issued Information Sheet No.19 on 7 November 1996. The information sheet said the following about the issue: Concern has been expressed that many computer systems may require modification to the software in order to process correctly dates including the Year 2000 and subsequent years. The UITF discussed the accounting for the cost of such modifications and concluded that they should be written off as incurred. It is not proposed to issue an Abstract on this topic. Australia The Urgent Issues Group of the Australian Accounting Research Federation has issued an Abstract on the topic. Abstract 12 deals with accounting for the costs of modifying computer software for the Year 2000. The Abstract deals only with the treatment of costs incurred to modify existing software and related systems used for internal purposes to overcome Year 2000 design faults. The consensus set out in the Abstract is that: 25 Costs relating to the modification of internal-use computer software for Year 2000 compatibility must be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. The discussion of the consensus notes that this view reflects that the cost of modifying computer software does not give rise to an asset. The modification costs are incurred to maintain the software’s existing service capacity (absent the Year 2000 design limitation), not to otherwise enhance the service capacity of the software beyond its existing condition or extend its useful life. This may be true in terms of the functions performed by the program, but it does not recognise the usefulness generated by the extended life of the program. In effect, by modifying an asset so that it operates beyond the date it would have ceased operating (or ceased operating to its desired level) there is a new asset created in a temporal sense. 26 Other International Accounting Standard IAS-16 (“Property, Plant and Equipment”) states at paragraph 24: Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment that has already been recognised should be added to the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits, in excess of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset, will flow to the enterprise. All other subsequent expenditure should be recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Paragraph 25 of the Standard gives examples of improvements that give rise to increased future economic benefits. One of these is modification of an item of plant to extend its useful life. This would provide some support for the opposite view to those above, that Year 2000 expenditure should be capitalised. New Zealand To date the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand has not issued anything analogous to the Abstracts or Newsletters published by the established accounting bodies in the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia. Summary While accounting treatment is one of the factors to be looked at in classifying an amount as capital or revenue, accounting treatment is never conclusive of the tax treatment of transactions (see for example CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,321 (CA)). It is worth noting that there are different objectives for financial reporting and tax accounting and interpretation. As the Supreme Court of Canada said in Canderel Limited v Canada \[1998\] 1 SCR 147 at paragraph 36: ...financial accounting is usually concerned with providing a comparative picture of profit from year to year, and therefore strives for methodological consistency for the benefit of the audience for whom the financial statements are prepared: shareholders, investors, lenders, regulators, etc. Tax computation, on the other hand, is solely concerned with achieving an accurate picture of income for each individual taxation year for the benefit of the taxpayer and the tax collector....Therefore, while financial accounting may, as a matter of fact, constitute an accurate determinant of profit for some purposes, its application to the legal question of profit is inherently limited. Caution must be exercised when applying accounting principles to legal questions. Indeed, financial reporting pronouncements may allow choices of methods, and be influenced by matters of practicality, matching and/or materiality, which in the absence of explicit statutory direction, are not generally matters that influence tax interpretation. Furthermore, the overseas accounting pronouncements do not exhibit a depth of reasoning of the type that would be influential in determining the appropriate characterisation in the income tax context. The American reasoning appears to have been based on ease of accounting treatment. The United Kingdom’s pronouncement does not disclose the reasoning behind it. The Australians attempt to justify the position taken by reference to standard accounting 27 practice and the absence of an asset arising as a result of the expenditure, although as discussed there are some questions over this. IAS-16 is the only international accounting practice that would favour capitalising Year 2000 expenditure. Although the majority of the international accounting sources would expense Year 2000 expenditure, seemingly based on the absence of an asset as a result of the expenditure, the case law already discussed suggests capitalisation is appropriate. Other revenue authorities’ pronouncements United Kingdom The United Kingdom tax authority’s position on the Year 2000 issue was set out in Tax Bulletin issue 35, April 1998. That bulletin confirmed the Inland Revenue view that the cost of a project to ensure millennium compliance will be treated as a revenue cost for tax purposes. The Bulletin stated: Our view is that an in-house or contracted-out software project to ensure that existing systems can be adapted for the millennium will always be a revenue matter unless it is part of a major new project instituting other changes and the project is of a capital nature. The Bulletin does not provide the type of conceptual or interpretative reasoning that would be of assistance for the Ruling. United States The Internal Revenue Service has issued announcement 97/50 which states that expenditure incurred in making systems Year 2000 compliant may be treated in accordance with Revenue Procedure 69-21. Revenue Procedure 69-21 allows taxpayers to treat the costs of developing software as either a deductible current expense or as capital expenditure amortisable over five years. Because of the similarities between expenditure incurred in making a system Year 2000 compliant and expenditure incurred in developing software under Revenue Procedure 69-21, announcement 97/50 is hardly surprising. However, it is not applicable to New Zealand because Revenue Procedure 69-21 is in conflict with the New Zealand legislative position that software is a capital asset that is depreciable, and that the development of software is on capital account. Canada Revenue Canada’s position on Year 2000 expenditure was set out in Income Tax Technical News, # 12, 11 February 1998. In that item, Revenue Canada stated: Whether a particular expenditure should be expensed or treated as a capital expenditure is a question of fact that is to be determined based on an appreciation of all the surrounding circumstances. To determine whether expenditures incurred to eliminate the millennium bug are of a capital or income nature, consideration should be given to determine whether the expenditure was made with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage of enduring benefit. For instance, if a particular software program is only restored to its original condition so that it performs the same applications but the problems of the millennium bug have been eliminated, the expenditures incurred to eliminate the bug would normally be considered to be of a current nature. 28 However, any expenditure that would improve or enhance the software would usually be looked upon as being an account of capital. The Canadian pronouncement does not discuss the key issue of whether the lifespan of software has been extended when the Year 2000 problem is removed. As such it is not considered to provide authoritative guidance for the Ruling. Notwithstanding the conflicting conclusions of the overseas pronouncements when compared to the Ruling, none of the pronouncements from the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada give extensive conceptual or interpretative reasoning as to the position taken. In these circumstances they are of limited assistance in interpreting the deductibility of Year 2000 expenditure in New Zealand. Australia The situation in Australia has been dealt with in a public ruling (Taxation Ruling TR 98/13). The ruling states that expenditure on initial diagnostic work is on revenue account, even if no further work is necessary. Expenditure on modifying and testing computer software is on revenue account even if it also provides minor improvements. Apportionment may be required when other upgrades are involved. At the same time as a draft of the ruling was released, the Australian Budget provided that certain expenditure that would otherwise be on capital account would also be deductible up until 31 December 1999 (for example, a new software system). Interestingly, the Australian ruling denies the applicability of repairs and maintenance cases to the Year 2000 expenditure issue. Instead, the ruling suggests that it is principles of general deductibility that determine the issue. At paragraph 35 of the ruling the focus is not so much on whether or not the expenditure gives rise to an enduring benefit, but on whether the expenditure enhances the asset itself so as to add to the structure of the business, or whether the expenditure is part of the day to day processes of the business in operating its assets. It considers the non-applicability of the enduring benefit test an important qualification, saying that it is inappropriate to apply an enduring benefit test to work done on computer software of a capital nature which by its nature does not suffer from wear and tear such that the work would always provide an enduring benefit. At paragraph 36 of the ruling, it states that it is the character of the expenditure at the time it is incurred that is relevant. The expenditure is incurred to allow a system to continue functioning in the same way after the Year 2000 as it did before the Year 2000. The ruling says that this is not part of the business structure but is part of the day-to-day processes. Year 2000 expenditure is said to be no different to ongoing maintenance work on a system, which is on revenue account. An exception to this general rule is stated in paragraph 38. It relates to a situation where the work done to make software Year 2000 compliant results in the original software being substantially rebuilt, and produces a different software system. In such cases, the expenditure will be on capital account, as it will be treated as being 29 incurred in acquiring a new software program. The written down value of the replaced software can be written off at the time of replacement. The Budget announcements from the Australian Treasurer foreshadow legislation to extend the class of expenditure immediately deductible to also include expenditure on acquiring new software (including upgrades) or substantially rebuilding current software which has the predominant nature of ensuring Year 2000 compliance. The conclusion that the enduring benefit test is not relevant to computer software is an important point. This means that the ruling accepts the view that Year 2000 expenditure does not increase the life expectancy of a computer software program. Given this, it follows that the ruling then finds that Year 2000 expenditure does not improve the software system or lead to a different software system. On this basis the conclusion that expenditure does not bolster business structure, but is simply part of the business process, also follows. For the reasons discussed above the Ruling and this commentary respectfully disagree with this view and the initial assumptions upon which it is based. Inland Revenue materials Public Information Bulletins There have been two PIB items dealing with the conversion of business machinery as a result of the introduction of decimal currency and metric measurements. Such situations are analogous to the changes required as a result of the Year 2000 problem. It is relevant to consider the PIB items as they give an idea of the views taken by the Commissioner in the past. In PIB No 28 (December 1965) the Commissioner set out the policy relating to machine conversion as a result of the introduction of decimal currency. There were three categories of office machines covered by the PIB. Category A included new cash registers, adding machines, and accounting machines installed on or after 1 January 1953, 1 January 1956, and 1 January 1959 respectively. These machines were converted at Government expense, and as there was no cost to the firm the item concluded that there was no tax allowance to the owner of the machinery. Category B included cash registers, adding machines, and accounting machines installed new between 1 January 1948 and 31 December 1952, 1 January 1952 and 31 December 1955, and 1 January 1956 and 31 December 1958 respectively. For these machines the Government made a cash grant, based on the residual life of the machine, to meet replacement cost. The item concluded that if the machine was converted so as to be capable of dealing with decimal currency, the owner should deduct the compensation from the Departmental written-down value of the machine. The cost of conversion could either be claimed as a deduction in the year of conversion, or added to the adjusted written down value and depreciated at scale rates on the new value. Category C machines were those machines which had reached the end of their normal useful life and for which there was no Government assistance. As for category B 30 machines, if the machine was converted the costs of conversion could be claimed either as a business expense or capitalised and depreciated. The Commissioner also issued a PIB at the time businesses were converting to metric measurements. PIB 63 (September 1971) set out the tax treatment of the costs of converting machines to metric measurements. In the situation where a machine was converted, the cost was able to be claimed in the year of conversion or at the option of the taxpayer added to the book value of the machine and depreciated. The treatment of costs incurred in the conversion of business machines for the introduction of decimal currency and metric measurements appears to allow deductibility as a concession. Further, the ability for such costs to be capitalised suggests that at the time there was a view that such expenditure might be of a capital nature. Support for this latter view comes from the Australian approach to the introduction of decimal currency and the metric system. Sections 53F (decimal currency) and 53G (metric system) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Aust) provided that amounts expended on converting plant to cope with the respective systems were allowable deductions to taxpayers. Each of the sections had a specific deeming provision that deemed the expenditure to not be expenditure of a capital nature. This legislative solution appears to demonstrate the uncertainty surrounding the appropriate classification of such expenditure, and appears to allow deductibility as a concession. Tax Information Bulletins The most relevant TIB item is the computer software policy statement in the Appendix to TIB Volume Four, No. 10 (May 1993). As with PIB items this item gives an idea of the views taken by the Commissioner in the past. The computer software policy statement provided a significant change to Inland Revenue’s position. Before the policy statement, computer software was treated as a fully deductible expense. After the policy statement, taxpayers were required to capitalise software and depreciate it. The computer software policy statement sets out the tax treatment of computer software in six different situations: • Software purchases • Specified leases of software • Software developed in-house for use in business • Commissioned software • Software leases other than under a specified lease • Software developed for sale or licence. For the first four types of software, the policy statement consistently noted that maintenance costs may be deducted, while upgrade costs must be capitalised and depreciated. Page four of the policy statement set out the understanding of the Commissioner as to what was maintenance and what was an upgrade. MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES 31 Payments made for the maintenance of software used for business purposes will be deductible, as the business does not gain an enduring benefit. Software maintenance ensures the software continues in its original intended state. Maintenance corrects errors or keeps the product updated with current information. It includes such things as adding data items to a thesaurus, software encyclopaedia, or database. Generally, maintenance activity includes routine changes which do not materially increase the capacity or performance of the software. Inland Revenue would generally accept that payments for the following are deductible maintenance payments: • help desk facilities; • fixing programme bugs; • bringing performance up to the original specifications of the software; • making minor changes such as increasing field sizes. An upgrade of a computer software package provides a new advantage to the business, so there is a new enduring benefit. Payments for upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Generally, an upgrade of computer software: • adds new features to the software; • increases its capacity or performance; • extends the life of the software; • provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. .. The nature of the payment in each case will determine whether it is deductible. Simply labelling a payment as a maintenance payment will not necessarily make it deductible. Maintenance will not cover situations where software obtains new features to increase capacity or performance and/or to extend its life, or where the user gets another version of the software with more capacity or increased performance. Sometimes a payment may cover both maintenance and upgrades (whatever the payment is called). The taxpayer must then apportion the cost between the revenue and capital items. There may be some debate as to whether Year 2000 costs are in relation to maintenance or an upgrade. It appears Year 2000 expenditure could be described as any of the following activities that were described as “maintenance” in the policy statement: • Fixing program bugs; • Bringing performance up to the original specifications of the software; and • Making minor changes such as increasing field sizes. However, the Year 2000 problem does not fit comfortably within these descriptions on further analysis. First, although the changes required in making a program Year 2000 compliant may be minor in terms of the actual recoding of the program, it is not accurate to say that they are minor in the context of the overall program. There may be a minor change to the code, but a major change to the continuing usefulness of the program. Second, it is debatable whether Year 2000 changes bring the software’s performance up to its original specification. Year 2000 expenditure will not improve the functionality of software; it will simply enable it to continue at its current level of performance. It will extend the life of the program beyond its original design limit of 32 the year 2000, but this is not the same as bringing the performance up to its original specification. Finally, it is questionable whether the Year 2000 problem would normally be described as a “program bug”. A program bug would normally be some part of the program that does not work according to the manner in which it was intended to work. The Year 2000 problem is instead a time restriction on the usefulness of software. While this may be a bug in a purchaser’s mind in the sense that the purchaser intended the program to continue beyond that date, it is not a bug in the sense that the program does not currently work according to specification. The characteristics of an upgrade were described as: • Adding new features to software • Increasing the capacity or performance of software • Extending the life of software • Providing a new version of software that has more capacity or increased performance. If only basic modifications of the program are taken to solve the Year 2000 problem, then neither the first nor the last of these characteristics will be involved. However, any Year 2000 expenditure that simply modifies the program will have the second and third characteristics. The third characteristic is that an upgrade will extend the life of the software. Clearly the Year 2000 expenditure, to the extent that it is successful, will extend the life of software that would otherwise have crashed in the Year 2000, or would have ceased to operate at the desired level of performance. This is a characteristic of an upgrade. In terms of the second characteristic, increasing capacity or performance, while solving the Year 2000 problem may increase performance in the sense that the program will last longer, a simple modification with no enhanced functionality will probably not increase capacity or performance. Summary The PIB items do not give clear guidance as to how to treat Year 2000 expenditure. They allow deductibility of machine conversion for external changes, apparently as a concession, but also provide for capitalisation. The computer software policy statement, while not conclusive as to whether costs related to Year 2000 expenditure should be deducted as maintenance or capitalised as an upgrade, provides more support for treating the expenditure as an upgrade and capitalising it. Where non-compliant software is replaced, rather than amended to make it compliant, the computer software policy statement applies to the new software and treats it as being on capital account. Conclusion 33 Overall, while the matter is not entirely free from doubt, the better view is that Year 2000 correcting and testing expenditure is expenditure of a capital nature. The primary reasons for the Commissioner taking this view are: • The need or occasion giving rise to the expenditure is of an unusual and unique nature. • In light of the fact that the Year 2000 problem is an inherent flaw in a program, the expenditure is for once and for all and gives rise to an enduring benefit, namely the prolonged existence of computer systems beyond the previous date limitation of the year 2000. • The payments can be seen as reinforcing the business structure of the taxpayer. • The cases on repairs and maintenance discussed above which, when applying the capital/revenue distinction in circumstances analogous to Year 2000 expenditure, find the expenditure to be capital in nature. Such expenditure is properly to be capitalised and depreciated by the taxpayer, and the depreciation allowance will be an allowable deduction under section BD 2(1)(a) and subpart EG. Comments on technical submissions received There were seven key categories of comment in the submissions received in relation to this ruling. These categories all favoured a revenue classification of all Year 2000 expenditure: 1. The Year 2000 problem is not an inherent limitation but is a bug, like any other computer bug. 2. The Year 2000 expenditure needs to be broken down between different categories of expenditure as per the Commissioner's computer software policy statement. 3. Expenditure on the Year 2000 problem is a normal business occurrence. 4. Application of the tests from BP Australia supports a revenue classification. 5. Year 2000 expenditure does not give rise to any improvement, but just restores the function of the software. 6. The repairs and maintenance cases favour a deduction for Year 2000 expenditure. 7. Consistency with overseas revenue authority and overseas accounting pronouncements favours a revenue classification. Point 1 above has been dealt with in this commentary under the heading Classification of Year 2000 problem. It is not accepted that the Year 2000 problem is a “bug” in the sense suggested. Point 2 has been noted as having merit, and the Ruling and this commentary do deal with different categories of expenditure relating to the Year 2000 problem. 34 Point 3 has been dealt with in the discussion of the first test from BP Australia. It is not accepted that the Year 2000 problem is a normal business occurrence. Point 4 has been considered, but for the reasons set out above the Ruling and this commentary still conclude that the tests in BP Australia favour a capital classification for Year 2000 correcting and testing expenditure. Point 5 is very much linked to the first, and for the reasons set out therein the submission has not been accepted. Point 6 has also been considered, but again the Ruling and this commentary still conclude that the cases discussed, to the extent they are applicable to an intangible like computer software, favour a capital classification. Point 7 regarding consistency with overseas pronouncements is addressed in this commentary. For the reasons given when dealing with international accounting treatment and overseas revenue authorities’ pronouncements, the desire for consistency between the Ruling and these sources of guidance is a policy issue, and does not bear upon the interpretational conclusions of the Ruling and this commentary. As well as these categories of comment a number of other submissions are worth noting. One submission has suggested that for some computer software the arrival of the year 2000 will not be so fundamental in nature as suggested in the Ruling and this commentary, but may only mean there are a few minor flaws with the program. There was even a suggestion that these flaws may be such that the taxpayer in question is not concerned enough to incur expenditure to remedy them. In the event that the taxpayer does not incur expenditure in correcting the software, the Ruling will not apply to such taxpayers as they will not have Year 2000 expenditure. However, where such taxpayers do decide to correct the software (because the flaw, though minor, is annoying), the Arrangement to which the Ruling applies does cover that taxpayer as it will be the case that the software could not correctly perform its functions in respect of dates after 31 December 1999. Even where only one function is affected, the expenditure incurred will be improving the program in respect of that function. Another submission suggested that given the short economic life of computer software, and the increasing trend to early obsolescence, Year 2000 expenditure does not really extend the useful life of the software. While some software may have a short economic life, other software does not (which is in some way a reason for the Year 2000 problem). Irrespective of the economic life of a program, software is treated by the Act as a capital asset. As Year 2000 expenditure enhances the life of a capital asset, and is an improvement, it is on capital account whether or not that increase in life is just a few years or a considerably longer time. 35 Some submissions have expressed the view that it is not possible to treat all taxpayers the same in respect of Year 2000 expenditure (excluding here taxpayers who hold software as trading stock). Such submissions suggested that each taxpayer needs to be treated on a case by case basis. It is considered that when determining the classification of Year 2000 expenditure there are sufficient common factors between taxpayers that the case-by-case variations are not so significant as to prevent a generic application of the conceptual principles set out in the Ruling and this commentary.
1 FORESTRY RIGHTS – SECONDHAND GOODS GST INPUT TAX DEDUCTION PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/5 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/3 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 3, September 1995, but its period of application is from 1 October 1998 to 30 September 2001 and some formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 95/3 applies up until 30 September 1998. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (the definition of “input tax” at paragraph (c) and the definition of “secondhand goods”) and 20(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply to a GST registered person of a forestry right by way of sale in the following circumstances: • The sale is not a taxable supply; and • The right is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and • The right is acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and • The right has been used by at least one prior owner for its intrinsic purpose. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A forestry right is a secondhand good for which an input tax deduction is available within the section 2(1) definitions of “input tax”, paragraph (c), “secondhand goods”, and section 20(3). 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 October 1998 to 30 September 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of November 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/5 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 98/5 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 95/3 (Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No. 3, September 1995 at page 1, under the heading “GST: Secondhand goods input tax deduction for forestry rights”). This Ruling extends that coverage to 30 September 2001. Background We had been asked to clarify whether a GST registered person who buys a forestry right by way of a non-taxable supply may make a secondhand goods input tax deduction. It had been unclear whether a forestry right can be a secondhand good. Legislation Section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 defines “forestry right” (for the purposes of that Act): “Forestry right” means a right granted by the grantor of any land to any other person to- (a) Establish, maintain, and harvest; or (b) Maintain and harvest,- a crop of trees on that land, together with- (c) Any ancillary rights of access and of constructing and using such tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings, and other works and facilities as may be necessary to establish, maintain, and harvest or, as the case may be, to maintain and harvest that crop; and (d) Any provisions for charges, payments, royalties, or division of the crop or the proceeds of the crop,- whether or not such rights or provisions are coupled with an obligation; but no such right shall be capable of conferring a right of exclusive possession of that land. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 states: Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, every forestry right shall be deemed to be a profit à prendre. Section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. Section 2(1)(c) defines “input tax” in relation to secondhand goods: “Input tax”, in relation to a registered person, means- (c) Any amount equal to the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time of supply within the meaning of section 9 or any other provision of this Act) of the consideration in money for the supply, being a supply by way of sale that is not a taxable supply, to a registered person of any secondhand goods situated in New Zealand, not being goods that are supplied by a supplier who- (i) Is not resident in New Zealand; and 4 (ii) Has previously supplied the goods to a registered person who has entered them for home consumption under the Customs and Excise Act 1996,- being in any case goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax, and states: Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period- (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- ... (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: ... (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: Application of the Legislation Under sections 2(1) and 20(3), seven conditions must be met before the purchase of a forestry right by a GST registered person will permit a secondhand goods input tax deduction: • Forestry rights must be “goods” as defined in section 2(1). • The supply of a forestry right must be by way of sale. • The supply of the forestry right must be a non-taxable supply. • The sale must involve payment in the taxable period for which an input tax deduction is sought. • The forestry right must be secondhand. • The forestry right must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. • The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of sale. The following paragraphs consider some of these requirements. “Goods” 5 The Commissioner considers that a forestry right (as defined in section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) is a “good” for GST purposes. “Goods” means all real and personal property but does not include choses in action. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 deems forestry rights to be profits à prendre. This confirms the common law position that a forestry right is a profit à prendre. A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person's land. A profit à prendre is an interest in land. It is not a chose in action because the rights under a profit à prendre are of a possessory nature, whereas a chose in action can only be enforced by action. An example of a “chose in action” is the granting of a licence at a boat marina. The benefits arising from the licence cannot be obtained by taking possession of the licence, but by action against a licensor who refuses to honour the licence. On the other hand, a forestry right, which can be enforced by taking possession, is real property and a “good” for GST purposes. “Sale” A secondhand goods input tax deduction is only available if there is a supply by way of sale. Forestry rights are a form of transferable property right, like other profits à prendre, and may be sold. It will be a question of fact whether there has been a sale rather than a lease or sub-grant of a forestry right. Because of the definition of “input tax” in paragraph (c), a secondhand goods input tax deduction is available only where there is a sale. The sale must be by way of a non-taxable supply for an input tax deduction to be available. “Payment” An input tax deduction is only available to the extent that there has been payment for the goods in the relevant taxable period. Therefore, if there is a sale by instalments, input tax deductions are available only in the taxable period in which each instalment is paid. “Secondhand” The forestry right must be “secondhand” before an input tax deduction is available. The Commissioner considers that land is a secondhand good. This is supported by case law, e.g. Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105. The Court of Appeal decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 appears to have confirmed this view, notwithstanding earlier obiter dicta that land may not be a secondhand good in L R McLean v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (CA) and King v Bennetts (1994) 16 NZTC 11,370. However, when a specific interest in land, like a forestry right, is newly created, it is a unique mix of rights distinct from the original land over which it was created. Accordingly, the original grant of a forestry right cannot be a sale of secondhand goods. The forestry right is a new item of property. Before a forestry right can be a secondhand good, at least one prior owner must have made use of the right for its intrinsic purpose which is to take trees from the land, L R McLean v CIR (CA). 6 Therefore, as long as the prior owner has exercised this right by physically removing trees, the forestry right will constitute a secondhand good when sold. Example Purchaser is a GST registered person who intends to enter the forestry industry in a small way. On 1 July 1996 she buys a forestry right from Supplier, who is not registered for GST. Supplier had bought the right 18 months earlier from a farmer who had decided not to diversify into forestry. Supplier had used the right on a small scale to remove a small amount of timber. The purchase price is $20,000 payable in four quarterly instalments. The first payment is made on 1 August 1996. Purchaser is entitled to a secondhand goods input tax deduction because the forestry right was disposed of by sale, the seller was unregistered (non-taxable supply), the forestry right was secondhand, and Purchaser acquired the right for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In Purchaser’s next GST return (for the two months ending 31 August 1996) she should deduct as input tax the tax fraction of the amount of the first instalment ($5,000). Accordingly, she may deduct $555.55.
1 NETHERLANDS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS - TAXATION WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS A NEW ZEALAND RESIDENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/6 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”), and to the Double Taxation Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand (which appears in the Schedule to the Double Taxation Relief (Netherlands) Order 1981, S.R. 1981/43) hereinafter referred to as “the Double Taxation Convention”. This Ruling applies in respect of Article 19(2) of the Double Taxation Convention. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the periodic payment of a Netherlands social security pension to a person who is a resident of New Zealand, and there is no arrangement with the Department of Work and Income under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964 to pay the person’s Netherlands pension to that Department in order to receive the full rate of a benefit or benefits under that Act or the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990. If the recipient of such a pension is also eligible to receive a benefit or benefits under New Zealand’s social welfare legislation and a reduction has been made to that New Zealand benefit by the Department of Work and Income under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964, the Ruling only applies to the extent of the amount of the Netherlands pension over and above the amount of the reduction. This person may be a national of the Netherlands, or of New Zealand, or of both countries. For the purposes of this Ruling the word “national” has the meanings attributed to it by Article 3, paragraph 1.h of the Double Taxation Convention. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • When a New Zealand resident receives a Netherlands social security pension, and that person is also a New Zealand citizen, the pension is taxable only in New Zealand. • When a New Zealand resident, who is not a New Zealand citizen, receives a Netherlands social security pension, the pension may be subject to tax in both the Netherlands and New Zealand; the Commissioner giving a credit for tax paid in the Netherlands in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 1998 to 30 November 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of November 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/6 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 98/6 (“the Ruling”). Background Confusion has arisen as to the New Zealand tax treatment of social security pensions paid by the Netherlands Government to people living in New Zealand. Some taxpayers believe that the pensions are not taxable in New Zealand if the recipients are not New Zealand citizens. Legislation Section BD 1(2) states: An amount is not gross income of a taxpayer if it is ... (c) a foreign-sourced amount and the taxpayer is a non-resident when it is derived. Article 19(2) of the Double Taxation Convention reads as follows: a. Any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, one of the States or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority and any pension paid to an individual under the social security scheme of one of the States, may be taxed in that State. b. However, such pension shall be taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident if he is a national of that State. Article 3(1)(h) defines the term “national” to mean: 1. in the case of the Netherlands, any individual possessing the nationality of the Netherlands, and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in the Netherlands; 2. in the case of New Zealand, any individual possessing citizenship of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in New Zealand. Article X of the Protocol to the Double Taxation Convention states: X. With reference to Articles 18 and 19 It is understood that the term “pensions and other similar remuneration” includes only periodical payments. 4 Application of the Legislation Under the Income Tax Act 1994, persons who are resident in New Zealand are subject to New Zealand tax on their worldwide income. Double Taxation Conventions with other countries override the Income Tax Act and determine which country has jurisdiction to tax the income in question. Among other issues the Double Taxation Convention between the Netherlands and New Zealand determines the tax treatment of periodic pensions paid by an organisation in one country to residents of the other country. Article 18 of the Double Taxation Convention sets out which country has the jurisdiction to tax pensions paid by one country to the residents of the other country. This article, however, does not apply to pensions paid out: • under social security schemes, or • for services rendered to the country paying the pension. Instead, Article 19 defines which country may tax these pensions. Article 19(2)(a) states that the country paying a social security pension may tax the pension. The use of the word “may” in this Article permits both the country of residence and the country paying the pension to tax the pension. If the pension is taxed by both countries, the country of residence will credit the recipient with the amount of tax deducted by the country paying the pension. New Zealand will do this under its foreign tax credit rules in Subpart LC of the Income Tax Act 1994. Article 19(2)(b) limits the application of Article 19(2)(a). It provides for the pension to be “taxable only in the State of which the individual is a resident if he is a national of that State”, thereby giving the State of residence an exclusive right to tax the pension when the recipient is a national of that State. The Double Taxation Convention defines a person to be a national of New Zealand when that person is a citizen of New Zealand. Accordingly, under Article 19(2)(b) New Zealand will have an exclusive right to tax a Dutch social security pension when the New Zealand resident recipient is a New Zealand citizen. (This will be so whether or not that person is also a Dutch national. In the case of dual nationality, the recipient will still satisfy the requirements of Article 19(2)(b) - New Zealand residency and citizenship - and the additional fact of possessing Dutch nationality will not alter the conclusion that only New Zealand may tax the pension.) However, if the pensioner is resident in New Zealand and is not a New Zealand citizen, New Zealand will not have an exclusive right to tax the pension but may do so. The Netherlands may tax the pension at the time that it is paid to the New Zealand resident. People who are not New Zealand citizens and have tax deducted by the Dutch Government from their Netherlands social security pensions are entitled to tax credits under section LC 1. When this occurs the Commissioner will, in accordance with New Zealand’s foreign tax credit rules, give the recipient a tax credit for the tax paid in the Netherlands. However, these tax credits cannot exceed the amount of tax due in New Zealand. 5 It is intended that the Ruling will apply only to those Netherlands social security pensions that are paid directly to New Zealand residents and the value of which is more than any New Zealand benefit or benefits that are received. If the recipient has entered into an arrangement with the Chief Executive of the Department of Work and Income to reduce any benefit according to the amount received from the Netherlands, or to receive the full rate of a social welfare benefit in return for the Netherlands social security pension (section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 applying in these cases), then to the extent that the Netherlands pension is reduced by these arrangements, it is exempt from income tax. That is, paragraphs (f) and (fa) of section CB 5(1) would apply in those circumstances. Example 1 A taxpayer is a Dutch citizen who emigrated to New Zealand two years ago. He receives a Netherlands social security pension. He has not become a New Zealand citizen, but is a tax resident of New Zealand. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands may tax his pension. New Zealand will grant him a tax credit for the tax charged on the pension by the Netherlands. Example 2 A taxpayer also has Dutch nationality and emigrated to New Zealand five years ago. She likewise receives a Netherlands social security pension. Unlike the taxpayer in Example 1 she has become a New Zealand citizen. Only New Zealand may tax the social security pension that she receives from the Netherlands.
1 EASEMENTS - DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE COSTS OF PREPARATION, STAMPING, AND REGISTRATION PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections DJ 11, BD 2(2)(e), EF 1(5), and the section OB 1 definitions of: “estate” or “interest”, “lease”, and “leasehold estate”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the tax deductibility of expenditure incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Easements will be treated as leases for the purposes of section DJ 11. • The Commissioner will allow a deduction for costs incurred by a taxpayer in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements where they are used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, in the income year in which the expenditure is incurred. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 January 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30th day of November 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/7 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/7 (“the Ruling”). Background Land may have its utility enhanced by the right to the use of an easement. Once registered an easement gives an interest in the land that is of enduring benefit. Subject to the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion, section DJ 11 permits a deduction for the costs of the preparation, stamping, and registration of “any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income”. The issue is whether an easement is a “lease of property” as defined in the Act. Legislation Section DJ 11 states: The Commissioner may allow such deduction as the Commissioner thinks fit in respect of expenditure incurred by a taxpayer during an income year for the preparation, stamping, and registration of any lease of property used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income, of any renewal of any such lease, or in the borrowing of money employed by the taxpayer as capital in the derivation of gross income. Section BD 2(2) specifically excludes certain expenditure or losses as allowable deductions from gross income derived by a taxpayer. Relevant for the purposes of this Ruling is the section BD 2(2)(e) exclusion for expenditure or loss of a capital nature which states: An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is ... (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or Section EF 1(5)(d) states: The amount of the unexpired portion (if any) of any amount of accrual expenditure of any person to be taken into account in any income year shall be - ... (d) Where the expenditure relates to a payment for, or in relation to, a chose in action, the amount that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable. The following are defined terms in section OB 1: “Estate” or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: 3 “Interest” – ... (b) In relation to land, has the same meaning as “estate” “Lease” – (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means any disposition whatever by which a leasehold estate is created: “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: Application of the Legislation The nature of an easement The essential elements of an easement, as developed by common law, are that: • there must be a dominant tenement and a servient tenement (Hawkins v Rutter \[1892\] 1 QB 668); and • the easement must accommodate the dominant tenement such that it is related to the utility of the land and must do more than confer a personal benefit on the owner of the land (Re Ellenborough Park \[1955\] 3 All ER 667); and • the dominant owner and servient owner must be different persons (Metropolitan Rly Co v Fowler \[1892\] 1 QB 165); and • the easement must be capable of forming the subject matter of the grant (Re Ellenborough Park). In New Zealand the common law elements of an easement have been modified by statute. The statutory modification has created “easements in gross”. Section 122 of the Property Law Act 1952 allows the creation of easements in gross. An easement in gross is one where there is no requirement for a dominant tenement. The right created by the easement is not appurtenant to another parcel of land. This modifies the first element of a common law easement, that there be a dominant and servient tenement. While statute permits an easement where there is no dominant tenement, there must be a servient tenement. This is necessary, for if the right granted by the easement arises from ownership of the land, there is no requirement to claim that right as an easement as it already exists. Two other features of an easement, while not defining characteristics, further describe the rights and limitations of an easement: • An easement permanently binds the land over which the right is exercised, and similarly subsists permanently for the benefit of the dominant tenement. One issue that arises is whether the rule against perpetuities applies to an easement. If the right created by the easement vests immediately with the grantee, authority indicates that the rule against perpetuities does not apply (Ellison v Vukicevic (1986) 7 NSWLR 104). 4 • The notion that an easement cannot and does not confer a right to possession in the land over which the right is granted (Copeland v Greenhalf \[1952\] 1 All ER 809). An easement is a lease for the purposes of the Act Although an easement is not an estate in land, it is an interest in land as contemplated by the law of real property. In Auckland City Council v Man O’War Station Limited \[1996\] 3 NZLR 460, Anderson J observed: An easement... is an incorporeal hereditament, which is a right in respect of land, and therefore an interest in land, but it is not land in the tangible sense nor an estate in land in the common law sense. \[page 465\] \[emphasis added\] An easement may be distinguished from other lesser rights such as a licence. A licence is a personal right and so does not pass an interest in the land in the way that an easement does (Errington v Errington \[1952\] 1 All ER 149 and Thomas v Sorrell (1673) 124 E.R. 1098). A lease, as contemplated in the law of real property, is an estate of less than freehold. Estates of less than freehold exist where the duration of the estate is certain or capable of being made certain (Charles Clay & Sons Ltd v British Railways Board \[1971\] 1 All ER 1007). Adams EC (Ed) in Garrow’s Law of Real Property (Butterworths, Wellington 1961) categorises leases whether for a fixed term, at will, or at sufferance as the estates of less than freehold. For the purposes of the Act, a “lease” is defined in section OB 1 as any disposition by which a “leasehold estate” is created. An easement is created by a disposition of property. The owner of the fee simple which will become the servient tenement surrenders, or disposes of, part of his or her right in the land to another person. Also implicit in the definition is that the disposition must create a leasehold estate. That is, the disposition must not be one that, for example, transfers the leasehold estate in the land. An easement qualifies, as it is not a transfer of any interest in the land but the creation of an interest in the land, a right that attaches to land so that it may improve its use and benefit. “Leasehold estate” is also defined, as any estate however created, other than a freehold estate. The concept of a “freehold estate” was developed by common law. A freehold estate is one of uncertain duration: the feature that distinguishes it from an estate of less than freehold, i.e. a lease. In the case of individuals it is uncertain as it is measured by reference to their lives. For corporations, it is uncertain, as they may continue on indefinitely. There are three types of freehold estates in New Zealand: the fee simple which will enure until the holder of the estate dies intestate without heirs, the life estate which will continue only for the life of the holder and is extinguished on that person’s death, and the stratum estate created by section 4(2) of the Unit Titles Act 1972. The term “estate”, also defined in the Act, is coupled with the word “interest”. “Interest” is defined as having in relation to land the same meaning as “estate”. For 5 the purposes of the Act, therefore, the terms “estate” or “interest” are merged and treated synonymously. An easement is an interest in land. A lease is an estate in land. The term “lease” is the nomenclature used in the Act for estates or interest in land unless specifically excluded, such as estates of freehold and mortgages. An easement as an interest in land is therefore a “lease” as defined in the Act, and section DJ 11 applies to the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of easements. Exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion A deduction for the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement under section DJ 11 is subject to the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion. There exists no direct case authority on how the Commissioner should exercise the discretion conferred upon him in section DJ 11. The words granting the discretion do not fetter the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion. In this respect the Commissioner is bound only to act fairly and according to the law (Gisborne Mills Ltd & Ors v C of IR (1989) 11 NZTC 6194, Reckitt & Coleman (NZ) Limited v Taxation Board of Review \[1966\] NZLR 1032 and Lowe v C of IR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,006). Discussed below are two legislative provisions considered by the Commissioner as relevant in exercising the discretion conferred in section DJ 11. The first is the capital/revenue distinction. The costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement are typically for most taxpayers, capital expenditure. This view is based on the one-off nature of the expenditure, the enduring nature of the benefit, and that land generally is part of the taxpayer’s business structure. Capital expenditure as such is non-deductible under section BD 2(2)(e), unless the Act expressly permits otherwise. Deductions allowed in part D of the Act, which includes section DJ 11, are an expressly permitted exception to the non-deductibility of capital expenditure contained in section BD 2(2)(e). To give effect to section DJ 11, it is necessary that a deduction for such expenditure is not disallowed on the basis that the expenditure is capital in nature. The second provision considered is spreading deductibility, for the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement, under section EF 1. Essentially, section EF 1 adds back as income the unexpired portion of any expenditure incurred. As such it is a qualification to the general rule that a deduction for expenditure is available when it is incurred. Section EF 1 does not operate to deny a deduction, but is a provision directed to the timing of the deduction. If an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the Commissioner must, under section BD 4(2), allocate the deduction to an income year in accordance with that regime. If the lease is a conventional lease which is for a term certain, the provisions of section EF 1 may be readily applied . Where the lease is one, such as an easement, which runs with the land, it may be considerably more uncertain as to the application of section EF 1. Relevant for this discussion is section EF 1(5)(d) which deals with the spreading of deductions for choses in action. 6 The uncertainty arises as an easement is an incorporeal hereditament, enforced by action, and therefore a chose in action. A chose in action is a term used “to describe all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by physical possession” (Torkington v Magee \[1902\] 2 KB 427, 430). One of the elements of section EF 1(5)(d) is the requirement to add back the amount of expenditure “that relates to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the chose is enforceable”. Important in this respect is the concept of “period”. The notion of a period has two elements: • it is a continuous and unbroken duration of time; and • it is an interval with a commencement point in time and a point of determination. Therefore, a period has the connotation of a continuous interval of time for which there is a commencement point and a point of cessation (London & India Docks 9 T.L.R. 11, and JLG Investments v Sandwell District Council \[1978\] E.G. 845). In applying the notion of a period to an easement, it is arguable that all expenditure incurred would be added back. As an easement runs with the land, subsisting permanently for the benefit of the dominant tenement, the total expenditure will be added back as the unexpired portion. Applying this reasoning, section EF 1 would operate to disallow a deduction, notwithstanding that the easement had been used, as part of an interest in the land, to derive gross income. As was emphasised by the Court of Appeal in Thornton Estates Ltd v C of IR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,577, section EF 1 spreads the timing of the deduction; it does not prohibit a deduction. An alternative approach to section EF 1 would be to add back the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement in each period until the easement is no longer enforceable by the taxpayer, (i.e. no part of the effect of the expenditure is treated as spent in relation to the taxpayer until that taxpayer disposes of his or her interest in the land benefiting from the easement.) This interpretation assumes that the end point of a “period” need not be certain while the time is running. The difficulty with this interpretation is that it does not distinguish between an uncertain period and no period. An easement has no period as it runs with the land indefinitely – it does not have a point of determination. A further potential issue with adopting the alternative view, is that if a taxpayer such as a corporation never disposes of the land benefiting from the easement, then the taxpayer may never receive a deduction. It is considered that the better view of the law is that expenditure incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements is deductible when it is incurred. This approach is consistent with the view that expenditure for the preparation, stamping, and registration of easements may be allowed when incurred, under section DJ 11. It is also consistent with the view that an easement has no period over which the expenditure may be spread, and so the provisions of section EF 1 do not apply, and 7 that any method otherwise used by the Commissioner to spread the deduction would inevitably be arbitrary and subjective. Incurred expenditure allowable by the Commissioner In considering the deductibility of expenditure incurred in the preparation, stamping and registration of easements it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify the types of expenditure that may or may not meet the statutory character specified. For this reason the Ruling does not specify what expenditure comes within, and what is outside, that criteria. Rather, the character will be established by showing that the expenditure is for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement, such easement being used in the derivation of the taxpayer’s gross income. There is, however, one exception and it is of particular relevance to the element of “preparation”. It is not uncommon for the owner of what will become the servient tenement to receive a sum of money for granting the easement. Is such a payment part of the easement’s “preparation”? The word “preparation” has not being judicially considered in terms of section DJ 11. However, the word “preparation” or “prepare” has been considered judicially (Horsley v Collier and Cartly Ltd \[1965\] 2 All ER 423 and Calabria v R \[1982\] 151 CLR 671). Those cases point to the word “preparation” indicating something that is done prior to it being ready for its use. In the case of an easement, until the right to create is granted there is nothing to prepare. A payment for the right to create an easement is the consideration that allows its “preparation” to be commenced. While it is a question of degree whether the expenditure incurred has the required nexus with the preparation of the easement to be deductible, a payment made for the grant of an easement lacks sufficient nexus to be within section DJ 11. Such payments to the owner of the servient land for the right to create an easement, which are not deductible, are distinguishable from payments made for the preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement, which, in some instances may also be made to the owner of the servient land, and are deductible, e.g. a payment made to the owner of the servient tenement equal to the owner’s costs incurred on legal and survey fees. Comments on technical submissions received One submission received suggested that section EF 1 may not apply because there may be no unexpired portion in respect of expenditure made. This could occur, for example, where the solicitor preparing, stamping, and registering the easement had fully performed his or her contractual obligation in consideration for the payment received. However section EF 1 requires that expenditure which “relates to a payment for, or in relation to...” a chose in action is spread with reference to the unexpired portion of the period that the chose is enforceable. In interpreting the phrase “relates to a payment for, or in relation to...” case authority indicates that it should be given a wide rather than a narrow interpretation (Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, Picture Perfect Ltd v Camera House Ltd \[1996\] 1 NZLR 310 and 8 Slattery (Trustee of) v Slattery \[1993\] 2 CTC 243). The phrase also imports a concept of connection or nexus between the expenditure incurred and “something”. The expenditure on the legal fees must relate to, or be in relation to “something”. Where that expenditure “relates to a payment for, or in relation to” a chose, section EF 1(5)(d) requires that the amount relating to the unexpired portion of the chose is added back. The better view of the law is that the cost incurred in the preparation, stamping, and registration of an easement is expenditure that “relates to a payment for, or is in relation to,” a chose. As noted above an easement is a chose that has no period over which the unexpired portion may be spread, and it is for this reason that section EF 1 does not apply. Example Farmer Ltd is a company conducting its agricultural and horticultural activities in an area where rainfall is limited and there is no natural irrigation. Farmer Ltd arranges for irrigation to be provided to the property. This requires reticulation across a neighbouring property. Farmer Ltd incurs survey costs and legal fees in the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement allowing the diverted water to be transported to Farmer Ltd’s property. Farmer Ltd agrees to pay the owner of the neighbouring property a one-off lump sum payment for the right to create the easement. In addition, the owner of the dominant tenement, Farmer Ltd, agrees to pay the legal costs for reviewing and approving the drafted easement’s documentation incurred by the owner of the neighbouring property, i.e. the owner of the servient tenement. The survey costs and legal fees, including those paid for the owner of the neighbouring property, are costs for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and so are deductible in the income year in which they are incurred. The cost of the irrigation scheme itself is not part of the costs of preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement. The one-off payment to the owner of the neighbouring property for the right to create the easement is not for the preparation, stamping, and registration of the easement and therefore is not deductible.
1 TRADING STOCK – TAX TREATMENT OF DISPOSALS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 98/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, FB 3, and OB 1 (definition of “trading stock”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to sales and dispositions of property (including contracts of sale of, and agreements to sell property) that is part of the trading stock of a business owned or carried on by the vendor. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • When stock is sold in the ordinary course of business, section CD 3 applies to include within gross income, amounts that are “derived” from that sale. For these purposes, such derivation occurs when the income is earned, being when a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. • If trading stock is sold outside the ordinary course of business, and/or together with any other assets of the business (whether the whole of the business or only a part of the business), section FB 3 applies to include within gross income for that year, all amounts received from the sale or disposition of that trading stock, or as the case may be, the price at which the Act deems the trading stock to have been realised. The date of sale or disposition differs, depending on whether a clearly expressed intention of the parties exists as to when property in the goods is to pass: • If a clearly expressed intention of the parties as to the time of passing of property is evident from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, the date of sale or disposition will be the date the parties intended property in the goods to pass. • If no clearly expressed intention as to the time of passing of property can be determined, the date of sale or disposition will be determined according to the appropriate statutory presumption contained in section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908. In short: • If there is an unconditional contract for goods that are specific and in a deliverable state - the date the contract becomes unconditional. • If the vendor must do something to make such goods deliverable – the date such action is completed, and the buyer is notified. 2 • If the vendor must weigh, measure, or test such goods in order to ascertain the selling price – the date such action is completed and the buyer is notified. • If goods are delivered to a buyer on “sale or return” or similar terms – the time at which the buyer signifies his or her approval or retains the goods without notifying rejection within an agreed or reasonable timeframe. • If unascertained or future goods are sold by description – when the goods are in a deliverable state and unconditionally appropriated to the contract by either party with the assent of the other. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 February 1999 to the end of the 2002 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 16th day of December 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 98/8 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 98/8. BACKGROUND Where the trading stock of a business is being sold or disposed of, there has been some confusion about the point in time when the consideration is to be included in gross income. The confusion centres on whether the proceeds from the sale or disposal of trading stock should be included in gross income when delivery and payment occurs, or upon the sale and purchase agreement becoming unconditional. Inland Revenue became aware of this issue in the context of livestock sales, but the legal principles which determine this issue are applicable to trading stock per se and this public ruling applies to all trading stock. Further confusion arose in terms of the question of whether section CD 3 or FB 3 applied to sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business. In order to address the question, it has been necessary to look at the history of the sections, case law, and general principles of contract law as well as the effect of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 on contracts of sale of property. LEGISLATION Part EE of the Act ensures that the value of trading stock at the beginning and end of the income year is taken into account when calculating the income of a business for tax purposes. Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section FB 3 states: Where in any income year the whole or any part of the assets of a business owned or carried on by any taxpayer is sold or otherwise disposed of (whether by way of exchange, or gift, or distribution in terms of a will or on an intestacy, or otherwise, and whether or not in the ordinary course of the business of the taxpayer or for the purpose of putting an end to that business or any part of it), and the assets sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include any trading stock, the consideration received or receivable for the trading stock or, as the case may be, the price which under this Act the trading stock is deemed to have realised shall be taken into account in determining the taxpayer’s gross income for that year, and the person acquiring the trading stock shall, for the purpose of calculating the person’s taxable income for that year or for any subsequent income year, be deemed to have purchased it at the amount of that consideration or price. This section shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in any case where a share or interest in any trading stock is sold or otherwise disposed of by any taxpayer. “Trading stock” is defined in section OB 1. It is defined slightly differently for the purposes of different sections of the Act, and over time. However, for the purposes of this discussion, it is sufficient to state that it includes anything produced or manufactured, anything held for sale or exchange, and livestock, but that it does not include land or financial arrangements to which the qualified accruals rules apply. 4 APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION AND CASE LAW Which section applies? Section CD 3 includes within gross income amounts derived from any business. If sales of trading stock occurred in the ordinary course of business, it would be expected that section CD 3 would apply to include such amounts within gross income. However, a broad and literal interpretation of section FB 3 would include amounts received from the sale of trading stock, whether or not the sale occurred in the ordinary course of business. In order to resolve this apparent inconsistency, it is necessary to examine the history and interpretation of the sections and their overseas equivalents. History of section FB 3 Section FB 3 was introduced in 1939 as part of a whole stock sub-code. It was acknowledged by the Hon. Mr Nash (recorded in NZ Parliamentary Debates Vol 256, 1939: 537) that the whole of the sub-code followed, to a large extent, the procedure adopted in Australia. However, the equivalent Australian subsection was explicit that it applied only to sales that were not made in the ordinary course of business. By expressly including the extra words in the New Zealand subsection, it must be presumed that Parliament had intended to address every possible existing and future mischief. Prior to 1939, there was no stock sub-code in the Act, and the forerunner to section CD 3 operated to tax proceeds from the sale of trading stock. The case of Commissioner of Taxes v Doughty \[1926\] NZLR 279 dealt with a single sale of stock (soft goods and drapery) when assets were moved from a partnership into a company vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that a profit derived from the sale of trading stock was assessable to tax, regardless of whether the stock was sold in the ordinary course of business or in a wind-up of the business, relying for support on Anson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1922\] NZLR 330. The Privy Council reversed the decision and said the sale was a result of a “slump market” and this was the sale of the whole business unit, which must be distinguished and certainly was not a sale made in the course of the taxpayer’s business. Accordingly, the increase in the value of stock sold was not subject to tax. In 1924 (after the Doughty case had been brought to the Commissioner’s attention, but before the Court of Appeal decision had been given), an amendment was made to (then) section 79(1)(a) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, which included within assessable income “all profits or gains derived from any business”. The words added to the precursor to the current section CD 3 were “including any increase in the value of stock in hand at the time of transfer or sale of the business...”. The additional sentence remained in place long after the enactment of the precursor to section FB 3 in 1939. It appears that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” included within section FB 3 had been included to prevent the section being circumvented, and to ensure that income from the sale of trading stock was always taxed, regardless of how it was effected. 5 No consideration appears to have been given to the overlap between the application of the two sections. Interpretation of section FB 3 In Hansen and Ors v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the precursor to section FB 4 (which deals with apportioning the consideration attributable to trading stock where such trading stock is sold together with other assets) could be used to permit the Commissioner to calculate the value of stock sold along with any other assets of the business, whether or not the overall purchase price agreed to by the parties specifically attributed an amount to the stock value. Haslam J discussed the history of the introduction of the “stock sub-code” and also subsequent changes to what are now sections FB 3 and FB 4. At page 205, he stated that: ... the Legislature intended that sections 98 to 102 inclusive should constitute a sub code for dealing with liability for taxation when trading stock (including livestock) is disposed of with other assets. (emphasis added). Whilst the conclusion reached by Haslam J is practically workable, and would clarify the inter-relationship between sections CD 3 and FB 3, it does not necessarily reconcile with a literal interpretation of section FB 3. Even if the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are read down, the section applies even where “... the whole or any part of the assets of the business ... \[that are\] sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include trading stock”. Therefore, the section will apply where the assets consist solely of trading stock, and there is no requirement that they be sold along with different assets. What is required, however, is that the “whole or any part of the assets of a business” have been sold or disposed of. This appears to require more than merely the sale of individual items of trading stock in the ordinary course of business. It suggests that the section applies to larger transactions involving other assets, and/or multiple items of trading stock where the sale is more akin to the sale or disposal of a group of business assets. Whilst trading stock is technically an asset of the business, ordinary English language usage would not normally see the ordinary sale of an individual item of trading stock described as a disposal of “part of the assets of a business”. In addition, it is relevant to note that the current structure of the Act clearly indicates that Part F deals with apportionment and re-characterisation of transactions. Such heading and structure of the Act imply that the section should not operate for sales of stock made in the ordinary course of business, but rather in more involved fact situations or where the Act treats transactions in a special way. Section AA 3(1) states that the meaning of a provision is to be found by reading the words in context and in light of the way that the Act is organised. The better view is that section FB 3 does not apply to normal sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business, and applies only where the whole, or part, of the assets of a business are sold (whether the trading stock is sold along with other assets, or a group of trading stock items are the only items sold). It is inherent in such a view that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are included in the section to effect the intent of Parliament that the section should not be rendered inapplicable by means of a taxpayer seeking to argue that it is in the ordinary course of their business to effect such compound sales. Such a conclusion arguably requires a degree of reading down of those 6 words, but results in a workable operation of the Act, and seems to reflect the Parliament’s intention. The result is that section CD 3 should apply to include within gross income all amounts derived from the sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, unless the trading stock is sold together with other items of trading stock, or assets of the business itself, in a way that suggests that (the whole or) a part of the business is being disposed of. Section FB 3 will apply to include within gross income the value of trading stock sold or disposed of outside of the ordinary course of the business operations, or along with other assets of the business in such a way. Specific instances when section FB 3 will operate will include instances where large blocks of different types of stock are sold to a purchaser, a part of the business is sold, or the entire business is sold by the owner. When determining the timing of gross income from stock sales, it will be important to ascertain which section applies. Section CD 3 includes proceeds from the sale of trading stock at the point in time they are “derived”. Section FB 3 includes such proceeds at the point in time the trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of”. This distinction can arguably be explained by the fact that ordinary derivation rules are to apply if usual trading stock sales occur in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. If the circumstances are otherwise, however, the Act may be seen to be “tightening” the test of the time of assessability. When amounts from the sale of trading stock are “derived” Section CD 3 operates to include within gross income amounts from the sale of trading stock sold in the ordinary course of business. It is settled law that the timing of derivation and the method of accounting “should be that which is calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income”. (C of T(SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Company of South Australia Limited (Carden’s Case) (1938) 63 CLR 108; CIR v Philips (NV) Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868; CIR v Farmers Trading Company Limited (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200). It is also settled law that the word “derived” means more than merely received. It connotes the source or origin rather than the fund or place from which the income was taken, and means flowing, springing, or emanating from, or accruing (Philips). There are also established principles that business taxpayers should use the accrual method of calculating income in order to give a correct reflex of income. This means income could be derived even if payment has not yet been received, or a bill even rendered. The general principle is that income is “derived” when it is earned, and has “come home” to the taxpayer. This will be the point at which a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. In looking at whether a debt has been created, case law tends to show that this is in effect a two-stage enquiry. The first stage is to ascertain whether the parties have agreed, or a statute has imposed a requirement, as to when a debt is created. When this is clear, for the purposes of income tax, the income in question is considered to have been derived at that time. If there is no such agreement between the parties or statutory imposition, it is necessary to look at the general law to determine when a debt is created and thus when the income is derived. 7 The leading New Zealand case on derivation is CIR v Farmers Trading Company Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200. This case dealt with the question of when business profits were derived from trading stock sold when the company made “budget” sales (where the customer paid the purchase price over a period of five months by way of monthly instalments). It was held that such sales were fundamentally different to hire purchase sales because the title and the property passed with the possession of the goods, and the vendor could only sue for outstanding instalments. It was held that the business profits were derived when the stock was sold and a debt in favour of the vendor was created. Richardson J (as he then was), cited Carden’s Case with approval and, in particular, he restated that “the foundation of the accruals system is the view that the accounts should show at once the liabilities incurred and the revenue earned, independently of the date when payment is made or becomes due.” At page 61,208, his Honour stated: The real question in this case is when trading profits are derived. Where a sale is made in the course of trade during the year any profit on sale must be recognised. That involves having regard to the debt arising in favour of the vendor and bringing it into account if it is practicable to do so. ... On sale of trading stock a debt arises in favour of the vendor. The stock leaves his account and prima facie the debt for which it was exchanged should be brought into account in its place. It is implicit in the legislation that trading debts cannot be ignored in the calculation of business profits and must be brought into account on a proper basis if that is feasible. ... \[T\]here may be no realistic way to reflect the debts in the trader’s account. But in principle debts arising from sale of trading stock during an income year must be recognised in arriving at the profits derived in that year. The Australian case of J Rowe and Son Pty. Ltd v FCT 71 ATC 4157 is consistent with the principles expressed in Farmers Trading. In this case the Full Court of the High Court considered when income was derived from the sale of stock by a retailer of household goods, in circumstances where the goods were purchased by customers but to be paid for by periodic instalments over an agreed term of 12 months or more. The sum to be paid was equal to the cash price plus 11% interest per annum, and the taxpayer included in assessable income returned for each year only the instalments received or receivable in that year. The Court held that for tax purposes a trader’s income is derived when it is earned, even though not received. The “profit emerging” method was considered inappropriate and the full cash price of the stock was considered earned and therefore derived during the year of the sale contract. Gibbs J stated at page 4,160: I agree that for taxation, as well as for business purposes, income of a trading business is derived when it is earned and the receipt of what is earned is not necessary to bring the proceeds of sale into account... The method adopted should be that which is “calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income: Carden’s case.” In delivering the majority judgment, Menzies J stated, at pages 4,158 and 4,159: It is implicit in the foregoing provisions that the proceeds of any sale of stock in the ordinary course of business will be brought into account in the year in which it is sold... In a system of annual accounting, ordinary business considerations would indicate that what becomes owing to a company for trading stock sold during a year should, in some way, be brought into account to balance the reduction of trading stock which the transaction affects. Any other method of accounting would lead to a misrepresentation of the trader’s financial position. ... 8 Acceptance of the taxpayer’s contention \[that income was derived only when instalments were due and receivable\] would, of course, largely destroy the accepted basis for the taxation of most trading and business concerns. The general principle that income is derived when it is earned, and that such time will be when there is an entitlement to payment or a legally enforceable debt, was also recently applied in Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685. In that case, Goddard J held that the taxpayer’s income was derived at the contemporaneous point in time the electricity was supplied by the taxpayer and consumed by its customers. This was because (on the facts) her Honour found that the income had been earned, and the taxpayer had a legal entitlement to payment – regardless of the fact that no invoice had been rendered. Sales of land Although land is not trading stock as defined (or subject to the Sale of Goods Act) it is worth noting that the same general principles in relation to derivation apply to the sale of land, or where the contract is otherwise an executory contract. However, although the applicable derivation principles are the same for land as for other property, the exact timing of when income is earned and a legally enforceable debt arises may be different. The difference will arise where the contract has an executory nature, and the vendor is not legally entitled to sue for the purchase price until after settlement. Cases that discuss the date of “sale” indicate that a sale of land occurs when a contract becomes unconditional (assuming there is no express intention of the parties that can be ascertained) - the same as for any other property or goods. However, the case of Gasparin v FCT (1994) 94 ATC 4,280 specifically addressed the question of when income from the sale of the land was “derived”. In delivering the judgment of the Full Federal Court, von Doussa J concluded that ordinary derivation principles applied, but a legally enforceable debt did not arise until the date of settlement and conveyance (when the executory contract was executed). Before this date, the vendor merely had a right to sue for specific performance of the contract, but not for the debt itself. His Honour stated that there was no difference between the sale of land or other executory contracts, and the sale of retail goods, in terms of the principles that apply to the question of derivation for tax purposes. He was satisfied that income is derived when it is earned and a debt is due, according to ordinary principles. The difference in the timing of derivation that occurred for the land in that case, compared to a sale of other goods, was caused by the fact that title did not pass to the purchaser, and there was no legal right for the vendor to sue for a debt prior to the settlement/conveyance. Because that was the only point at which a legal debt arose, derivation did not occur until that time. In delivering the decision of the Court, von Doussa J stated: I am unable to agree that there is no difference in the present case from a department store sale of articles on 30 day terms. In that example there has been a delivery of the articles sold. The contract of sale is no longer executory. A debt has accrued due; the debtor has become subject to an obligation to pay a sum certain in money even though the debt may not be payable forthwith: c.f. Carden. ... In the present case such a matching will occur if it is held that that trading stock is not disposed of for the purposes of the Act until there is under a transaction for the sale of land both a loss of “dispositive power” and the accrual to the trader of debt due by the purchaser. ... 9 The allotments in question remain registered in the name of the vendors until settlement. Until then the vendors have not lost all dispositive power and had not ceased to have any proprietary interest in the land. ... Prior to settlement, under the contracts of sale the purchasers undoubtedly acquired interests in equity and rights to specific performance but the vendors did not become bare trustees for the purchasers. ... In my opinion it should be held that the joint venturers derived income from the sale of the allotments of land which comprised the trading stock not when the contracts became unconditional but at settlement when a debt accrued due from each purchaser to the joint venturers. The critical consideration is for the time when the debt arose. It should also be held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement, that being the point in time in a transaction for the sale of land under a contract of sale in the terms of those before the court when the vendor finally uses all dispositive power, and the contingency that the sale will not proceed to completion disappears. Von Doussa J also pointed out that his conclusions were consistent with judicial “sign posts” on derivation principles, such as Barratt v FCT (1992) 92 ATC 4,275, Farnsworth v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 504, Henderson v FCT (1970) 70 ATC 4,016 and FCT v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 83 ATC 4,800. It must be remembered however, that the facts of each case need to be examined, rather than assuming all executory contracts will automatically result in derivation occurring on settlement. This is because the key differences identified by von Doussa J between ordinary goods and land sales, were the facts that property/title did not pass until settlement, and a legally enforceable debt did not occur until settlement. If the facts of a case clearly show an earlier debt (rather than being able to sue for specific performance) and/or passing of property, the time of derivation will be earlier. This possible distinction is well expressed by Salmon J in Ruddenklau v Charlesworth (1925) NZLR 161 where he stated: The general rule, however, that in an executory contract for the sale of land the vendor cannot sue for the price is excluded whenever a contrary intention is shown by the express terms of the contract. And it seems established by authority that a contrary intention is sufficiently shown in all cases in which by the express terms of the contract the purchase money or any part thereof is made payable on a fixed day, not being the day for completion of the contract by conveyance. In all such cases the purchase money or any part thereof becomes, on the day so fixed for its payment, a debt immediately recoverable by the vendor irrespective of the question whether a conveyance has been executed and notwithstanding the fact that the purchaser may have repudiated his contract. Notwithstanding such repudiation the vendor is not bound to sue for damages or specific performance, but may recover the agreed purchase money. When stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” The question of when stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” becomes important when considering section FB 3, where stock is sold along with other assets of the business. This is a different question to when income is “derived”. Sale of Goods Act 1908 The phrase “sold or otherwise disposed of”, as used in section FB 3, is not specifically defined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, but some guidance is provided by case law and the Sale of Goods Act 1908 (“SGA”), which indicate that a sale of goods occurs when property in those goods passes to the purchaser. Although section 2 of the SGA states that “’contract of sale’ includes an agreement to sell as well as a sale”, section 3 of that Act recognises a distinction between a “contract of sale of goods” and an “agreement to sell”. There is a “contract of sale of goods” when a seller agrees 10 to transfer property in the goods for a consideration called the “price”. A sale is effected once the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. In contrast, there is an “agreement to sell” when the transfer of property in the goods is to take place either at some future time or is subject to the fulfilment of some condition. A sale is effected either when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled. When property passes depends on whether the goods are specific or unascertained. The term “unascertained goods” is not defined in the SGA, but Butterworths Commercial Law in New Zealand (Borrowdale 3 ed, Butterworths) states at Chapter 12.3: ... it is clear that unascertained goods are goods which are not identified and agreed on at all. Unascertained goods become ascertained goods once they are identified and agreed on in accordance with the contract. Under section 18 of the SGA, no property is transferred in unascertained goods unless and until the goods are ascertained. Goods may be unascertained because they are generic goods sold by description (Re Gold Corp Exchange Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 385) or because they are not yet severed from part of a larger bulk (Re Wait \[1927\] 1 Ch 606). Specific goods are defined in section 2(1) of the SGA as “goods identified and agreed on at the time a contract of sale is made”. (a) The timing when the parties agree Section 19(1) and (2) of the SGA provide that property in specific goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intended to be transferred, and that when ascertaining the intention of the parties regard should be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circumstances of the case. Accordingly, any explicit intention of the parties as to when property in the goods passes will be recognised as the date the sale occurs. (b) The timing when the parties’ agreement is not evident However, in situations where the parties have either not formed an intention as to when property shall pass, or have not clearly expressed their intention, section 20 of the SGA sets out five rules for determining the moment when the property in the goods will be deemed to have passed from a seller to the buyer. Which rule applies depends upon such factors as whether the contract is for the sale of specific or unascertained goods, or the seller is bound to do something to the goods. For the purposes of this discussion, rule 1 in section 20 is considered the most relevant (and common). Section 20 states: Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer: Rule 1. Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, is postponed. Rule 2. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. 11 Rule 3. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 4. Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or “on sale or return” or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer – (a) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the transaction: (b) If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expiration of such time, and if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. Rule 5. (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. (2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract. Date of sale for section FB 3 The general principle is therefore that the date of sale occurs when property in the goods passes. When an express intention of the parties can be ascertained as to when property passes, that will be the date of sale. If no intention is expressed or can be ascertained, the date of sale will be ascertained according to the statutory rules/presumptions contained in section 20 of the SGA, (commonly the date an unconditional contract exists). This general approach has also been upheld in tax cases. Case law While there is no New Zealand case law on the effect of the SGA on section FB 3, the Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review referred to the Australian Sale of Goods Act when deciding in Case 18 (1946)12 CTBR 120 that property had been disposed of by way of sale when the contract became unconditional. The issue in Case 18 was whether the taxpayer’s property had for the purposes of section 36(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 been “disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever ...”. The Chairman of the Board of Review noted in relation to the sale of goods at page 125: The ownership of the goods will be transferred by the contract itself (in which case, the contract is the sale) if the parties express that intention but where the parties form no intention as to the time when the property is to pass, or fail to express their intention, the time when the property passes is determined by certain statutory presumptions. Of these presumptions the only one which deems the property in the goods to pass when the contract is made arises where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state. In view of these principles (... and most which are embodied in the Sale of Goods Act) it appears to me to be quite clear that the property in the goods which were included in the assets which where the subject of the contract under consideration did not pass from the taxpayer to the purchasers until 25 August 1943, when the last of the three necessary consents was given. The similarity of the SGA legislation in Australia and New Zealand (reflecting their common U.K. origins), coupled with the fact that the trading stock provisions in the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are very similar both in their treatment of trading stock and the wording in section 36(1), are factors which make Case 18 strong authority in New Zealand on this particular issue. 12 A similar result was arrived at in the context of when a sale of land had taken place, in Mills v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,025 when the High Court held that for a sale of land to take place there must be an unconditional agreement for the sale of the land. This principle was also upheld in Case K60 (1988) 10 NZTC 487. In Hansen v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, the Court considered the precursor to section FB 4 and whether the Commissioner could calculate the value of stock sold along with the other assets of the business, regardless of an overall price having been agreed to by the parties in relation to the stock value. Of interest to this discussion, the Court gave effect to the intentions of the parties in relation to when property in the livestock passed. In that case, prior to settlement the purchaser was not permitted to shear the sheep which were the stock of the business, and as such there was an implied lack of property in the sheep until that date. The Court concluded that settlement date was the appropriate date to value the sheep for the purposes of calculating their sale price, as that was clearly the date the parties intended property in the sheep to pass to the purchaser, and so that was the date on which they were sold. Whilst the SGA determines when there is a sale of personal property in New Zealand, the same principles have been applied to real property in the above cases. Accordingly, for the purposes of section FB 3 trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” when property in the goods passes. This will occur when the parties intend property to pass, where an express intention can be ascertained. If no intention can be ascertained, the statutory presumptions contained in Rules 1 to 5 of section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act will determine when property passes, and therefore when a sale or other disposition occurs. When a contract is unconditional As Rule 1 will often be relevant, it is important to understand when a contract becomes unconditional. An unconditional contract is a contract that is not subject to a condition precedent. The contract may still be subject to a condition subsequent, but this will not prevent the contract from being unconditional. “Condition precedent” is a legal term for those conditions in a contract which suspend a contract until a specified event has occurred. A common example of a condition precedent is a contract that is subject to finance. In other words, the contract will be suspended until the buyer has advised the seller that he or she has obtained the necessary finance. A “condition precedent” is to be contrasted with a “condition subsequent”, which is a condition which can either bring a binding contract to an end (either totally or only partially) or entitle a party to damages. A common example of a condition subsequent is a contract that entitles a buyer to return dairy cattle if they prove not to be eczema free or sound on delivery. An unconditional contract can still be subject to conditions subsequent. Qualified accruals rules The ruling does not consider any potential operation of the qualified accruals rules where the arrangement attracts the operation of those provisions. This may occur when settlement is scheduled to take place more than 63 days from the date an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into, or if there is a trade credit debt permitting 13 payment more than 63 days after the supply of the trading stock or date of a periodic invoice. In either case the arrangement will not be a “excepted financial arrangement”. If the qualified accruals rules do apply, the approach in the ruling will apply in relation to the consideration that is effectively attributed by the Act to the property sold (as distinct from any deemed financial arrangement income or expenditure that arises by virtue of section EH 1). Examples Example 1 A customer enters a sporting goods store and purchases a tennis racquet, which comes with a 30 day money-back guarantee if not completely satisfied. The customer pays by cheque. The income from the sale is derived by the store in terms of section CD 3 on the day the customer enters the store and purchases the tennis racquet. The tennis racquet is sold in the ordinary course of business, and at that point the income has been earned (and therefore derived), regardless of whether the cheque is subsequently dishonoured or the customer returns at a later date seeking a refund under the guarantee. Example 2 A motor vehicle dealer and purchaser sign a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of a motor vehicle on 12 March, which permits the customer to take delivery of the car that day, on payment of a 25% deposit. The contract provides that risk passes to the purchaser on delivery of the car, but property does not pass until payment of the balance of the purchase price, which occurs one month later. The income from the sale is derived in terms of section CD 3 on 12 March, as it is a sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, and on that day the income has been earned and a legally enforceable debt has arisen when the purchaser took delivery of the car. Example 3 On 20 May, Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a herd of dairy cattle, and a deposit is paid. The agreement states that the balance of the purchase price shall be paid on the day of delivery/settlement, and that property in the cattle passes on that day. The agreement is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 15 June. The vendor is entitled to continue milking the herd (and retain any proceeds) until the stock is delivered. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. The vendor culls 20% of her herd each year, so it is the within the vendor’s usual business to sell individual herds of cattle, and she is left with other herds to continue her business operations. The purchaser confirms on 3 June that finance has been arranged. The contract becomes unconditional on 3 June. Payment is made and possession given and taken on 20 June. 14 Section CD 3 applies, as the sale is made in the ordinary course of business, and for the purposes of section CD 3 the income is derived on 20 June. That is when the income is earned, the contract is no longer executory, and a legally enforceable debt first arises. This example illustrates the difference that is possible between the date of “derivation” and the date of “sale”. If this had not been a sale made in the ordinary course of business, the fact that the agreement explicitly stated that property in the goods passes on settlement would have resulted in the same date of 20 June being the date of sale. However, if there had been no express intention of the parties evident as to when property in the cattle passed (either by virtue of the agreement itself or the circumstances of the case/conduct of the parties), the date of sale for the purposes of section FB 3 would have been 3 June, when the contract became unconditional. (Unless Rule 4 or 5 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 applied, due to a delivery on an approval basis, or the goods being unascertained and sold by description.) Example 4 Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a plot of land and a herd of cattle on 15 April. The sale is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 20 May, with payment of the balance and possession being given on 19 June. Finance is confirmed on 20 May. The contract became unconditional on 20 May and payment is made and possession given and taken on 19 June. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. There is no clear indication in the contract as to when property in the goods passes. For the purposes of section FB 3, the cattle were sold on 20 May, when the contract became unconditional, as there is no express intention of the parties as to when property in the goods is to pass, and Rule 1 of the Sale of Goods Act applies. If the contract also stated that the cattle could be returned within 7 days if they were not eczema-free on delivery, and the purchaser signified later that same day that the cattle were pronounced eczema-free and would not be returned, the date of sale will differ. The existence of such a condition in the contract is a condition subsequent (rather than a condition precedent), and accordingly the contract is not conditional upon the cattle being eczema-free, and there is no alteration of the date the contract became unconditional. However, it does mean that the cattle are delivered on “sale or return” (or similar) terms, as envisaged by Rule 4 of the Sale of Goods Act. This means the date of sale will be 19 June, when the purchaser signifies his approval and retention of the cattle. If the parties had included an explicit clause in the original contract described above (without the “sale or return” terms) that delivery did not occur and property did not pass until payment was made in full, this intent would be recognised, and the sale would be considered to have been made, for the purposes of section FB 3, on 19 June. Example 5 A customer orders a photocopier from his regular office equipment supplier, by way of mail order from a catalogue description. The order is posted on 12 September, and received by the vendor on 15 September. A photocopier is taken from the stock warehouse and shipped on 20 15 September, with delivery to the customer taking place the next day. The standard terms of sale are that goods are sent FOB (which, for the purposes of this example, are taken to mean that risk, title, and property in the goods pass when the goods are put onto the delivery truck), and the photocopier is delivered with an invoice indicating the terms of payment. As this sale is made in the ordinary course of operating an office equipment business, the gross income from the sale is subject to tax under section CD 3. The income is “derived” on 20 September, when the stock is shipped, and it can be said that the income has been earned and a debt become due and enforceable under the terms of the sale. If the sale contract conditions were that the goods are delivered COD (and clearly indicated that risk, title, and property in the goods did not pass until delivery), the income would be “derived” on 21 September. In such a situation, no debt is enforceable until delivery occurs. If the order was for a bulk supply of photocopiers and facsimile machines sold by a vendor who was ceasing trade in electrical office appliances, section FB 3 would apply and the time of “sale” is what is relevant. Such an order is for generic items which are unascertained goods at the time the order is made. The goods do not become specific goods until such time as the particular photocopiers are identified, and it is possible to say that such items are the customer’s. In the absence of any differing clear contractual intention, this would occur on 20 September, which is when the items are appropriated to the contract, property passes and the sale occurs.
TERTIARY STUDENT ASSOCIATION FEES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/1 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/8 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No. 6, December 1995, but its period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002 and some formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 95/8 applies up until 31 March 1999. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by a student at a tertiary institution, of a single tertiary student association fee as a membership fee to that tertiary student association. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The payment of a single fee to the tertiary student association to become a member of the student association is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). The student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11th day of January 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/1 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/1 (“the Ruling”). Background If the recipient has charitable status, section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”) provides a rebate for the donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances. If a student pays a single fee to a student association to become a member of that association, the association has charitable status, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the issue is whether the fee is a “gift”. The subject matter was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 95/8 that expires on 31 March 1999. This public ruling replaces BR Pub 95/8 on 1 April 1999. The previous ruling concluded that if a student pays a single fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. Legislation Section KC 5 states: (1) In the assessment of every taxpayer, other than an absentee or a company or a public authority or a Maori authority or an unincorporated body, or a trustee assessable and liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2, there shall be allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the income year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisation, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa) A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad) A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (bt) \[A list of organisations\] (2) The rebates provided for in this section shall not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any income year exceed in the aggregate the smaller of- (a) 33 1 / 3 % of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b) $500. (3) No rebate shall be allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayer's claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (4) In this section, “gift” includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of the Legislation Under section KC 5, a taxpayer other than an absentee, company, public authority, Maori authority, unincorporated body, or trustee liable for income tax (sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, HZ 2), can claim a rebate if that person: • makes a gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more; • to any of the organisations listed in s KC 5(1) or any special appeal fund allowed by the Commissioner; and • the recipient in the opinion of the Commissioner applies the funds for a charitable purpose; and • the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a receipt evidencing the making of the gift by the taxpayer to the recipient. Furthermore, if a subscription is paid by the taxpayer to any organisation listed in section KC 5(4), the Commissioner must be satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. The payment of a single fee to a student association to become a member of the student association is not a “gift” under section KC 5, as the fee as a whole confers some rights on members. As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. There are two reasons for this view: 1. Payments of student association fees are not “gifts” in the ordinary meaning of that word, as payment is not voluntary, and benefits may arise from the payment. 2. Section KC 5(4) expands the meaning of “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5. A subscription will only qualify as a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 if the payer receives no rights to do anything, receive anything, or to have access to anything in return for the payment of the subscription. If any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. The meaning of the term “gift” In Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, (in the Court of Appeal) the nature of a gift was referred to by Cooke J who said: in general a gift is something truly gratuitous, although it is possible that nominal or very small considerations may not prevent transactions from being classed as gifts for some purposes: see 20 Halsbury’s Laws of England. In the same case, Richardson J said that at common law, the term “gift” refers to: a transaction where the owner of property conveys the ownership of that property to another without consideration. Similar views were expressed in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail \[1966\] 117 CLR 111, (known as “the McPhail rule”) where the Court held that a “gift” has the following attributes: • The property transferred was transferred voluntarily and not as the result of a contractual obligation to transfer it; and • The transferor by way of return received no advantage of a material nature. A similar view was taken by the Federal Court of Australia in Klopper & Anor v FC of T \[1997\] ATC 4186, which applied Cyprus Mines Corporation v FC of T 78 ATC 4468, and made reference to the McPhail rule. In Klopper & Anor v FC of T the taxpayers made donations to the Australian Sports Aid Foundation (ASAF). The Oceanic Racing Club of Australia received funds from ASAF that it credited to an account belonging to the taxpayers. The Court held that the donations made by the taxpayers were not gifts. It could not be said that the payments were free from contractual obligation and voluntary. It could not be said that the taxpayers received no advantage of a material character as a result of making the donations. The Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal also referred to the McPhail rule in Hodges v FC of T \[1997\] ATC 2158 and Australian Dairy Corporation v FC of T \[1998\] ATC 2059. In both cases, as there was an element of benefaction, it could not be said that a “gift” was made. Payments of student association fees are not “gifts” in the ordinary meaning of that word, as payment is not voluntary and benefits may arise from the payment. The definition of gift in section KC 5(4) Section KC 5(4) expands the meaning of “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5, to include subscriptions paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. It is arguable whether student association fees are subscriptions. There are many definitions of “subscription”, some of which are wide enough to include student association fees. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts. They conferred rights on the pupil. The Taxation Review Authority (“Authority”) noted that the Commissioner had allowed school activity fees as a deduction because they came within the expanded definition of “gift”. Other fees that conferred a right were not allowed as a deduction. The Authority did not comment on what the definition of a subscription was. However, assuming that the fees paid are a subscription, the fees will only be a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights on the payer. A subscription will only qualify as a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 if the payer receives no rights to do anything, receive anything, or to have access to anything in return for the payment of the subscription. Thus, the payment of a subscription is in the nature of a donation because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that the subscription confers no rights does not contain any words of apportionment (such as “to the extent to which”). It is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply and no rebate is available. The provision refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. In Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451, a taxpayer paid the fees of a number of disadvantaged children at a school which qualified as a charitable institution. The Authority held that the payments were not gifts, as the payment of the fees meant that the school had a contractual duty to educate the children. The Authority quoted the expanded definition of gift, but did not discuss either the definition of “subscription”, or whether the payments were a subscription (and thus covered by the extended definition of gift). The case was decided in terms of whether the fees paid were a “gift” in the ordinary meaning of the word. Students attending tertiary institutions pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Being a member commonly gives rights to benefits from the student association and other organisations, such as: • Access to advice, welfare, and counselling services. • Liaison services between students and teaching staff. • Access to newsletters and other information. • Facilities on campus, such as the library, health facilities, sports and recreation facilities. • Student discounts on various goods and services. In addition, it could also be argued that the payment of the student association fee is one of a number of payments a student must make, and things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at a tertiary institution. If the student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the student’s choice) is not paid, the student does not qualify for enrolment. The payment of the student association fee, therefore, confers a further right on students - the right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Similarly, payments to the student association (together with payment of other fees and meeting terms) give students the right to attend university and sit examinations. The student makes his or her payment to the student association, not to any other body which may later be allotted funds by the student association (for example, trust funds, hardship funds). The payment to the student association is a payment that confers rights on the student. Compulsory student membership is incorporated into statute in section 229 of the Education Act 1989. Under this section a University Council has the power to impose and collect student association membership fees from its students. This section remains unchanged at present. However, section 3 of the Voluntary Student Membership Bill 1997 intends to repeal section 229 and introduce voluntary student association membership. If the Bill is enacted it will not change the tax treatment of student association membership fees under section KC 5. A voluntary payment of student membership fees to a student association would fail to meet the requirements of section KC 5(4). That is, the payment would give rise to rights that the student could claim. At a minimum this would include the right to vote at an AGM and receive an annual newsletter. If the student receives any rights from the payment of that fee, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. Any legislative change that makes tertiary student membership voluntary would therefore not alter the tax treatment of student association fees under section KC 5. For the reasons outlined above, section KC 5 does not apply if the payment of a student association fee confers any rights. In these circumstances, no rebate is available. Example A student enrols at a Polytech. He pays the student association fees, and is able to use the gym facilities, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights on the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student association. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the Polytech and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed.
1 SUBSIDISED TRANSPORT PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS TO EMPLOYEES – VALUE FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 2(1), CI 3(6), CI 4(1), and the definition of “subsidised transport” in OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of: • Transportation to an employee by the employer of that employee, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public; or • Transportation to an employee by a person with whom the employer of that employee has entered into an arrangement for the provision of that transportation, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Where transportation is provided by the employer to an employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. • Where transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; or • The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid to the third party for the benefit being provided by the third party. In the definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1, “class” refers to the classes of transportation available, such as first, business, or economy class; “extent” refers to transportation with the same departure and destination points; and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of May 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/2 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/2 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Information Bulletin 136 (May 1985) at pages 28 and 29 under the heading “Subsidised Transport”. This Ruling supersedes that earlier statement. Background Employers who are in the business of providing transportation to the public may provide transportation to their staff, either free or at a price lower than that paid by the public. These employers may also enter into arrangements with third parties to provide the employers’ staff with either free transportation or transportation at a price lower than that paid by the public. If the provision of this transportation falls within the definition of “subsidised transport”, it is a fringe benefit. The employer will be liable to pay fringe benefit tax in accordance with the FBT rules. This Ruling applies where an employer, who carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public, provides transportation to an employee of that employer, or enters into an arrangement with another person for transportation to be provided or granted by that person to an employee of the employer. Legislation Section CI 1 states: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... (d) Any subsidised transport: “Subsidised transport” is defined in section OB 1: “Subsidised transport”, in the FBT rules, means the provision, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, by an employer, being a person who carries on a business that consists of or includes the transportation, for hire or reward, of persons who are members of the general public, to an employee of the employer of carriage or entitlement to carriage in the course of the transportation (not being transportation in a motor vehicle) where the amount (if any) paid by the employee of the employer in respect of the carriage or entitlement to carriage is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged, in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year in which the provision occurs, by the employer of the employee for the provision by that employer, to persons who are members of the general public, of carriage or, as the case may be, entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage first mentioned in the definition. 4 The main valuation provision for subsidised transport is section CI 3(6), which states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, the value of any fringe benefit, being a benefit that consists of subsidised transport provided in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, by an employer, shall be the greater of- (a) 25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer: (b) The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Section CI 4(1) further states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of the FBT rules the taxable value of any fringe benefit provided by the employer of the employee in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) in any income year shall be the value of that fringe benefit, reduced by- (a) The amount (if any) paid by the employee (or, where section GC 15(1) applies, by the associated person) in relation to the quarter or the income year for the receipt or enjoyment of that fringe benefit (not being an amount paid for the acquisition or improvement by the employee or associated person of an asset the receipt or enjoyment of which does not constitute the fringe benefit), except where the fringe benefit is an employment related loan: In relation to benefits provided by third parties, section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. The definition of an “arrangement” is provided in section OB 1: “Arrangement” means any contract, agreement, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. Application of the Legislation The legislative provisions concerning the valuation of subsidised transport provided to employees are uncertain in their application. This Ruling sets out how the Commissioner will interpret these provisions. Subsidised transport may be provided to an employee by the employee’s employer or by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide the employee with a benefit. These two situations are discussed separately below. Subsidised transport provided by the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by an employer to an employee of that employer is provided for in section CI 3(6). This requires the value to be the greater of: 5 • 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Some commentaries on the value of subsidised transport refer to the cost to the employer of providing the transportation. This has caused confusion about whether costs incurred by an employer itself in providing transportation to an employee, such as the cost of food and fuel on an airline, should be taken into account in the second limb of section CI 3(6). It is the Commissioner’s view that section CI 3(6)(b) was inserted into the valuation provision to provide for the situation where the transport is provided by a third party and the employer pays more to the third party for the transport than 25% of the highest fare. Previously, the valuation provision referred only to 25% of the highest fare. The words “liable to pay or has so paid” in section CI 3(6)(b) do not refer to the cost to the employer. Paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) only applies when an employer actually pays a third party to provide transportation for its employees. This situation is discussed below. If an employer provides transportation itself, there will generally be no amount that the employer is liable to pay, as the employer does not charge itself for the employee’s transportation. While the employer may incur costs in providing the transportation, these are not to be taken into account in determining the value of the benefit. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that, where the transportation is provided by an employer to an employee of that employer, the value of the benefit is 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. The meaning to be given to the “highest fare”, “class”, “extent”, and “occasion” is discussed below. Subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide transport to an employee of that employer is also provided for in section CI 3(6). The interpretation of this section is problematic. This is in part due to the effect of section CI 2(1). Under section CI 2(1), if an employer has entered into an arrangement with another to provide a benefit to an employee of that employer, the benefit is deemed to be provided by the employer. Interpreting section CI 3(6) without reference to section CI 2(1), the benefit is valued as the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and 6 • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. If the employer offers the same transportation to the public that was arranged to be provided to the employee by the third party, an amount will be charged by the employer to the public for the same transportation. In this instance, the benefit will be the greater of the two options. However, in the majority of cases, the employer will not provide the same transportation to the public as that arranged with the third party to be provided for the benefit of the employee. In this instance, there is no amount charged by the employer to the public for that transportation. The value of the benefit depends on the amount paid by the employer for the third party to provide the benefit. That is, it is only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) that is relevant. However, section CI 2(1) affects this interpretation. This section deems a benefit provided to an employee by a person with whom the employer has an arrangement to be provided by the employer. Reading section CI 3(6) in conjunction with section CI 2(1) may require ascertaining the highest amount charged by the third party to the public and the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. That is, reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. In other words, the highest amount charged by the employer refers to the highest amount charged by the third person, and the amount the employer is liable to pay or has so paid is a reference to the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. On the same reasoning that an employer does not charge itself for providing transportation to its employees, the third party does not charge itself for providing transportation to employees of the employer. Accordingly, the value of the benefit depends on the amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. Therefore, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) is relevant here. Alternatively, section CI 2(1) may not require reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. If this approach is taken, section CI 3(6) would be interpreted in the same manner as above where no account was taken of section CI 2(1). That is, it is only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) that is relevant here. The above interpretations, with and without reference to section CI 2(1), with the exception of the limited instance where the employer provides the same transportation service to the public as that provided to the employee by the third party, deny the requirement that the benefit be valued at the greater of two options of any meaning. However, combining the results from the two interpretations would give this requirement meaning in all circumstances. For example, the value of the benefit is the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and 7 • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided by the third party. It is acknowledged that this approach, which interprets the word “employer” in a different manner under each limb of section CI 3(6), is inconsistent with a strict literal interpretation of the section. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that, as the wording used in the legislation is less than ideal, this is the better approach where a benefit is provided by a third party. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that if transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit is the greater of: • 25% of the highest fare charged by the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the price the employer paid or is liable to pay to the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement for the benefit being provided. If the employer is not required to pay the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement, i.e. there is no price paid or payable by the employer for the benefit, the benefit is valued at 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. That is, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) has relevance in this situation. Other issues Carriage and entitlement to carriage A benefit arises on the provision to an employee of carriage or an entitlement to carriage. “Carriage” refers to the actual carriage on the particular transport, whereas “entitlement to carriage” refers to a specific right to carriage in the future. For example, a bus pass and an airline ticket are both entitlements to carriage. They both provide the employee with a future right to carriage. If the employee is not entitled to claim a specific right to carriage, e.g. because certain conditions must be met before the entitlement to carriage arises, there is no entitlement to carriage unless those requirements are fulfilled. For example, if an employee is provided with a standby ticket which is subject to the limitation that carriage will only be provided if special loading requirements are met, no entitlement to carriage arises until these requirements have been fulfilled and the employee is entitled to the future right to carriage. The employee may then choose whether or not to use the entitlement to carriage. No benefit to the employee will arise if the special conditions that the ticket is subject to are not fulfilled as no entitlement to carriage or carriage will have arisen. 8 Special conditions that employees may be subject to can be distinguished from intrinsic limitations that everyone is subject to, such as there being available seats on a bus when utilising a bus pass, for example. An employee with a bus pass has an entitlement to carriage, even though he or she may not gain carriage on the first bus that comes along because it happens to be full. In other words, the availability of seats is not a special condition that must be fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises, but a limitation inherent in bus travel that everyone is subject to. This situation can be contrasted with a standby fare, where carriage is subject to certain conditions being fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises at all. That is, where an employee is told that he or she will receive an entitlement to carriage or carriage provided certain conditions are first met. A further issue that arises in relation to entitlement to carriage is the suggestion that entitlement to carriage refers to carriage with restrictions attached. The example was given of standby type restrictions. The Commissioner does not agree with this interpretation. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, no entitlement to carriage will arise where the employee does not become entitled to the carriage. Special conditions or restrictions attached to a ticket are taken into account in the legislation by the use of a 25% basis for calculating the value of the benefit. This percentage reflects that employees may be subject to special standby type conditions, and therefore the value of the benefit should not be based on the full fare paid by the public. The benefit to the employee arises on the provision of the carriage or entitlement to carriage. It is irrelevant if the entitlement to carriage is not subsequently used by the employee. A benefit does not arise when a carriage is taken pursuant to an entitlement to carriage. For example, say an employee has been provided with a bus pass that entitles her to “free” carriage. A member of the public who has purchased a similar pass will also be provided with carriage without having to pay any more. No benefit arises to the employee in this situation. As neither the employee nor the member of the public is charged for the actual carriage, the employee does not receive the carriage for an amount less that the amount charged to the public. The legislation does not tax the one benefit as a “carriage” and then subsequently as an “entitlement to carriage”. A transportation benefit will not come within the “subsidised transport” definition if the same transportation is not sold to the public. This is because the employee would not be getting transportation at a lesser amount than is charged to the public. If the service is not sold to the public, there can be no charge to the public. However, such a benefit could come within section CI 1(h) as “any benefit of any other kind”. Highest fare charged The definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1 refers to the provision of carriage or entitlement to carriage where: ... the amount (if any) paid by the employee ...is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged ... by the employer ... to ... the general public, of carriage or ... entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage ... 9 In determining the value of the subsidised transport, section CI 3(6) then refers in paragraph (a) to: ... 25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer ... Accordingly, section CI 3(6) requires that the value of the benefit be determined according to the highest amount charged to the public for carriage or entitlement to carriage that is of the same class, extent, and occasion. It is the Commissioner’s view that “class” refers to the classes of travel available, such as first, business, or economy class, as that term is used in the travel industry. The Commissioner does not accept that standby is a class of travel. To include standby fares as a class is to confuse “class” with fares. The special conditions attached to a standby fare have been compensated for by valuing the benefit at only 25% of the amount charged to the public. It was stated in the second reading of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2) (NZPD Vol 461, 1985: 3722) that “The exemption effectively recognises that the true benefit enjoyed by the employee is somewhat less than the full value of the fare”. Further, “extent” refers to travel with the same departure and destination points, and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. It is arguable that the relevant fare is the highest fare charged during the quarter for travel of the same class and extent. However, this interpretation denies the word “occasion” in the definition of “subsidised transport” of any meaning. Both “quarter” and “occasion” need to be given meaning. It is arguable that the inclusion of the reference to “quarter” means the highest fare charged in the quarter as it was the intention of the legislation that the fare be the highest fare charged in the quarter. However, such an intent is not made clear in the legislation and this interpretation deprives “occasion or occasions” of any meaning. It is submitted that the words “in the quarter” are a reference to the fact that FBT is charged on a quarterly basis. This view is supported by the fact that the words “in the quarter” are followed by “or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year”. This appears to be a reference to the time that FBT is determined. The words “quarter or income year” are repeated throughout the legislation. Apart from the legislative intent, there is no evidence that “quarter or income year” have any greater meaning in this part than they do in any other part. There are differing views on what “occasion” means. The ordinary meaning of “occasion” is the time of occurrence of a particular event or happening. In this situation the particular event or happening is the carriage. Therefore, it would be consistent with this meaning to use the highest fare charged on the actual transportation as that is the time that the carriage occurs. It would not be consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion” to define it as the day that the actual travel takes place or as the time or season that the employee is allowed to travel. The better meaning to be given to “occasion or occasions” is the actual time of carriage. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion”. 10 In relation to an entitlement to carriage, the relevant occasion is the period of time for which the entitlement to carriage is valid. For example, if the provision is of a bus pass that entitles the employee to carriage on a bus for a period of a month, the relevant value of the benefit is the highest fare charged to the public for that bus pass in that month period. If the entitlement to carriage is a ticket for carriage in the future, such as an airline ticket, the relevant value is the highest fare charged to the public for that particular transportation. The Commissioner is of the view that the legislation requires the highest fare charged for the actual transportation to be used in valuing the benefit. However, it has been submitted that in some circumstances it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine this figure. Accordingly, the Commissioner will accept the highest published market fare that the employer or third party, with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for the provision of the benefit, ever charges for the service as evidence of the highest fare charged for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion by the employer or third party. For example, this could be by reference to the Air Tariff Worldwide Fares published by the Air Tariff Publishing Company. However, it is acknowledged that at times there are fares that are published but never charged to the public. Such fares would not satisfy this criterion. The highest actual fare charged is to be used where available in preference to the highest published market fare. Further, the Commissioner acknowledges the compliance costs involved in complying with the valuation provisions in relation to the occasion of the transportation. Accordingly, the Commissioner will allow the use of the highest publicised market fare charged, in the particular day, week, or month in which the occasion occurs, for transportation of the same class and extent as the value to be attributed to the benefit. Arrangement Section CI 2(1) refers to an employer that “has entered into an arrangement” with a third party concerning the provision of benefits by the third party to employees of the employer. An “arrangement” is defined in broad terms in the Act to mean “any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) ...”. Case law indicates that an “arrangement” includes an understanding between two or more persons in relation to an agreed course of action that may not be enforceable in law. However, it must be an arrangement “for that benefit to be so provided or granted”. An employer that merely allows a third party to place promotional materials offering travel in the staff-room, for example, would probably have entered into an arrangement with that third party, but it would not be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to the employee. It is necessarily a question of fact and degree in any given situation. Any understanding between an employer and a third party to provide a benefit to employees of the employer could constitute an arrangement to which section CI 2(1) applies. If the arrangement provides for the third party to provide numerous and ongoing benefits to employees of the employer, the employer would need a system in place to ensure that it is aware of exactly what benefits are being provided to its employees. 11 Employee contributions Under section CI 4(1), if an employee pays an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of subsidised transport provided by that employee’s employer, the value of the benefit provided is reduced by that amount. That is, once the benefit is valued according to section CI 3(6), any amount paid by the employee for that benefit is to be deducted from that amount. This is illustrated in the examples below. Examples Example 1 An airline employee takes an overseas holiday on his employer’s airline. He travels economy class. The highest price charged to the public for a ticket on that flight in economy class, with the same departure and destination points, is $650. The employee pays $200. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight $650 25% of this highest fare $162.50 As the employee pays more than the value of the benefit ($200 compared to $162.50), the taxable value of the benefit is nil and no FBT is payable by the employer. Example 2 An airline employee takes a holiday overseas on an airline that has an agreement with her employer. The highest price charged to the public for travel of the same class, extent, and occasion is $650. Under the agreement the employee’s airline pays $325 to the airline that carries the employee. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight $650 25% of this highest fare $162.50 Price paid or payable by the employer $325 The price paid by the employer is greater than 25% of the highest fare charged for the flight. As the employee does not make any contribution, the taxable value of the benefit is $325. If the employee pays the employer $200, that amount would be deducted from $325 and the taxable value of the benefit would be $125. Comments on technical submissions received The comments received in relation to this Ruling concerned five main areas. Specifically: 12 1. The valuation of a benefit provided by a third party and the relationship between sections CI 2(1) and CI 3(6). 2. Standby fares are a separate class of travel. 3. The difficulties in obtaining information as to the highest fare charged where a third party provides the transport. 4. With an entitlement to carriage, the benefit arises when the transport is taken. 5. Not all relationships between employers will constitute an “arrangement” for the provision of a benefit. Point 1 highlights that section CI 2(1) only deems the benefit to be provided by the employer; it does not deem the highest price charged by the third party to be the highest price charged by the employer for the purposes of section CI 3(6). The Ruling acknowledges the difficulties with the legislation and attempts to provide a workable solution to the valuing of transport provided by a third party. Point 2 has previously been raised during the consultation process. It is not accepted that standby is a “class” of travel. Point 3 concerns compliance with the Ruling and has been discussed in the commentary. Point 4 has been considered, but is not agreed with. To conclude otherwise would mean that an entitlement to carriage that is not subsequently utilised by the employee would not be subject to FBT. There is no requirement that the entitlement actually be used by the employee. However, this submission led us to question what constitutes an “entitlement to carriage”, as discussed in the commentary. Point 5 concerns the definition of an “arrangement”, and has been further discussed in the commentary.
1 LICENSED PREMISES’ OPERATORS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENDITURE PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/3 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/5 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No.12, April 1996, but its period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004 and some minor wording and formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 96/5 applied up until 31 March 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section DG 1 and Schedule 6A of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring of expenditure by any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator (“licensee”) and who, in the ordinary course of that business: • Incurs that expenditure on food or beverages and makes special offers of that food or beverage in arm’s length transactions with members of the general public. The special offers of food or beverages to which this Ruling applies include: • Happy hours where a licensee offers drinks to customers at reduced prices during a particular time period: • Offers of free drinks on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from the general public: • Two meals offered to customers for the price of one: • “Toss the boss” competitions where for every drink purchased, the customer can toss a coin and has the chance to win a free drink; or • Pays an allowance to an employee (such as a bar manager) to cover the costs of the employee providing in the ordinary course of business, free drinks to customers on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in a reserved area, or where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the customer. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 2 • The deduction available for expenditure on the special offers of food or beverages is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. • The deduction available for expenditure on the allowance paid to an employee is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of May 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/3 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/3 (“the Ruling”). All references to a “licensee” are to any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator. Background Under section DG 1, the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss on “specified types of entertainment” set out in Part A of Schedule 6A is limited to 50% of that expenditure, unless the entertainment or benefit is “excluded entertainment” under Part B of the Schedule. If the entertainment or benefit is excluded entertainment under Part B, the expenditure or loss is fully deductible, provided it is incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or it is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. Section DG 1 also treats an allowance paid to reimburse expenditure by an employee on specified types of entertainment that fall within Part A, as being expenditure by the taxpayer on the particular specified type of entertainment. Legislation Section DG 1 states: (1) This section and Schedule 6A are intended to limit the amount of the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss incurred on certain types of entertainment, being entertainment that generally involves a significant element of private benefit, to 50% of that expenditure or loss (but subject always to the express provisions of this section and Schedule 6A). (2) If a taxpayer incurs expenditure or loss on a type of entertainment or benefit (whether consumed or enjoyed by the taxpayer or anyone else) specified in Part A of Schedule 6A then, unless and to the extent that the entertainment or benefit is specified as excluded entertainment in Part B of that Schedule, the deduction allowed for that expenditure or loss will be limited to 50% of the amount that would be allowed as a deduction but for this section. (3) For the purposes of this section - (a) A taxpayer will be treated as incurring expenditure on a specified type of entertainment to the extent that the taxpayer pays an allowance for, or reimburses an employee’s expenditure on, the specified type of entertainment and the allowance or reimbursement is exempt income under section CB 12: .... Part A of Schedule 6A lists four “specified types of entertainment”: • Corporate boxes • Holiday accommodation • Pleasure craft • Food or beverages. 4 Effectively, a description of “food or beverages” for the purposes of Part A of Schedule 6A is contained in Clause 4 of Part A, which states: Food or beverages - (a) Provided or consumed as an incidence of any of the types of entertainment specified in clauses 1 to 3; or (b) Provided or consumed off the business premises of the taxpayer; or (c) Provided or consumed on the business premises of the taxpayer - (i) At a party, reception, celebration meal, or other similar social function; or (ii) In an area of the premises, such as a boardroom or an executive or client dining room, reserved for use at the time only by those at a certain level of seniority and their guests and not open to all employees of the taxpayer working in the premises. The Schedule defines “Business premises” as: (a) The normal business premises; or (b) A temporary workplace,- of the taxpayer or of an associated person (not being premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment). Part B of the Schedule lists excluded entertainment (i.e. entertainment which, being one of the specified types of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule, would otherwise be subject to the 50% deduction limit). Clause 9 of Part B states: Entertainment that is provided by the taxpayer for market value (or otherwise in an arm's length transaction) in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business which consists of providing one or more specified types of entertainment. Application of the Legislation The 50% deduction limit in section DG 1 applies to expenditure that is otherwise fully deductible but which is a “specified type of entertainment” under Part A and not “excluded entertainment” under Part B of Schedule 6A. Special offers of food or beverages to the public: A. As a “specified type of entertainment” When a licensee makes a special offer of food or beverages to the public, the expenditure on that food or beverages is, in most cases, not a specified type of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule (and thus not subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is despite the food or beverages being provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the licensee, in terms of clause 4(c) of Part A. Clause 4(c) has two sets of criteria, both of which must be met before such expenditure falls within a specified type of entertainment: • The first requires that the food or beverages are provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the taxpayer; and 5 • The second contains two alternatives, which require that the food or beverages be provided or consumed, either at a party \[clause 4(c)(i)\], or in a reserved area of the premises \[clause 4(c)(ii)\]. The special offers of food or beverages made to the public by licensees, although meeting the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), do not ordinarily come within either of the alternatives in the second set. In relation to the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), the licensed premises where the offer occurs are the licensee’s “business premises” as they are the normal business premises of the licensee. The definition of “business premises” in the Schedule excludes “premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment”. It could be argued that licensed premises are established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment and so would not be the licensee’s “business premises”. However, it is considered that from the licensee’s perspective, the licensed premises are established principally for the purpose of running a business and not for the purposes of enjoying entertainment, and so are the licensee’s “business premises” in terms of the Schedule. Note that, for the purposes of the definition of “business premises”, licensed premises are not a temporary workplace of a person who merely conducts a business meeting at the licensed premises because, from that person’s perspective, the licensed premises are a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment. As already indicated in relation to the second set of criteria in clause 4(c), food or beverages provided or consumed on “business premises” (apart from food or beverages consumed in a corporate box, holiday accommodation, or a pleasure craft) are only included as a specified type of entertainment if the food or beverages are consumed either at a party or similar social function, or in a reserved area of the premises. In some situations, food and beverages consumed on licensed premises may be consumed at a party or similar social function or in an area reserved at the time for use by certain employees and guests. However, special offers of food and beverages of the type to which the Ruling applies that are made to the public by the licensee during ordinary opening hours of the licensed premises, would not ordinarily be consumed at a party or similar social function, or in an exclusive area as contemplated in clause 4(c) of the Schedule. B. As “excluded entertainment” Quite apart from the position outlined above, special offers of food or beverages of the type referred to would be excluded entertainment under Part B of the Schedule (and thus not be subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is because those special offers of food or beverages would usually come within clause 9 of Part B. Clause 9 applies to expenditure on entertainment that is provided at market value, or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction, in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business where that business consists of providing one or more of the specified types of entertainment. Expenditure on such excluded entertainment is therefore fully deductible if the entertainment is provided by a business at market value or in an arm’s length transaction. 6 It follows that clause 9 applies to special offers of food or beverages made by a licensee to members of the general public if the food or beverages are provided either at market value, or are otherwise provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. In particular: • The cost to the licensee of “happy hours”, where reduced price drinks are provided to customers during a particular time period in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, will be fully deductible. • The cost to the licensee of free drinks, provided on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from members of the general public, is fully deductible if the provision of such free drinks occurs in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. • The cost of providing meals, offered in a “two meals for the price of one” deal, is fully deductible if the meals are provided in an arm’s length transaction with customers in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. • The cost to the licensee of drinks provided to customers in “toss the boss” competitions is also fully deductible if the competitor and the licensee have an arm’s length relationship. Where this occurs, the free drink prizes are provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of business. Allowances for free drinks for customers A licensee may pay a hospitality allowance to an employee, such as a bar manager, to cover the costs of providing free drinks to customers in the ordinary course of business. The expenditure on such an allowance is not subject to the 50% deduction limit. This is because the drinks are being provided or consumed on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in a reserved area of the premises as contemplated under clause 4(c) of Part A to the Schedule, or are not being provided where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the consumer. The allowance is fully deductible if it is incurred by the licensee in deriving the licensee’s gross income or if it is necessarily incurred by the licensee in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Examples Example 1 A licensee offers half-price drinks on Saint Patrick’s day to all patrons who wear a green hat. All other drinks are provided at full price. As the half-price drinks are provided to the green hat wearers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of the Schedule and is fully deductible to the licensee. 7 Example 2 A licensee offers the next round of drinks free for a period of one hour on a Friday night to any customer who, following the purchase of a round, is able to score more than 10 by throwing a single dart at a dartboard. As the free rounds of drinks are available to all customers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of the Schedule and is fully deductible to the licensee.
1 LAND SALES - WHETHER INCOME TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR FARM LAND APPLY TO NON-NATURAL PERSONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/4 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/8, published in TIB Volume Seven, No.13, May 1996, but the period of application is from 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2004 and some minor wording and formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 96/8 applied up until 31 May 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a non-natural person where the land had been acquired or used for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by that person and where the sale or disposition would otherwise be subject to section CD 1(2)(e), (f) or (g). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The words “the taxpayer’s spouse” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) do not restrict the meaning of “taxpayer” to natural persons. “Taxpayer” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) includes non-natural persons such as companies and trusts. Accordingly, the exemptions provided by section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) apply to a taxpayer that is a non-natural person if the other requirements of the exemptions are met. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of July 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/4 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/4 (“the Ruling”). Background Amounts derived from certain sales or other dispositions of land that would otherwise be gross income under section CD 1(2), are subject to a number of exemptions. This Ruling considers whether the exemptions contained in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a), that are available in respect of sales of farm or agricultural land in certain circumstances, apply where the taxpayer disposing of the land is not a natural person. Legislation Section CD 1(4) states: Subsection (2)(e) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that- (a) The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used or intended to be used- (i) By the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; or .... Section CD 1(7) states: Subsection (2)(f) and (g) shall not apply to any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land in any case where- (a) That land is a lot resulting from the division into 2 or more lots of a larger area of land which, immediately before that division, was occupied or used by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them, primarily and principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; and. .... Application of the Legislation The ordinary meaning of the words “by the taxpayer, or by the taxpayer’s spouse, or by both of them” in section CD 1(4)(a)(i) and section CD 1(7)(a) does not require the taxpayer to be a natural person. On a literal interpretation, by considering each alternative in section CD 1(4)(a) separately, a non-natural person taxpayer, e.g. a company, could clearly come within the words: “The land was acquired by the 3 taxpayer, and used ... by the taxpayer... principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer”. Alternatively however, it is possible for the reference to the “taxpayer’s spouse” to be interpreted as colouring the word “taxpayer” and limiting its meaning to natural persons. It is the Commissioner’s view that the words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that “taxpayer” as used in the exemptions is not restricted to natural persons. This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the exemptions. Prior to 1983, the exemptions only referred to “taxpayer”, and it was clear that a company or other non-natural persons could come within the exemptions. In 1983, the exemptions were amended to include taxpayers’ spouses. The intention at that stage was to extend the exemptions, rather than to narrow them to natural persons.
1 FREQUENT FLYER SCHEMES PROMOTED BY CREDIT CARD COMPANIES - FRINGE BENEFIT TAX LIABILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/5 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 2(1) and the definition of “arrangement” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of benefits under a “frequent flyer scheme” (FFS) by an employee through the use of a credit card supplied by an employer to the employee of the employer. The features of the FFS are: • The employees of the employer hold corporate credit cards. • The employees use the credit cards for the purchase of goods and services. Depending on the policy of the employer, the purchases may be in respect of employment related expenditure or private expenditure, or both. • The goods and services purchased by the employees may include airfares arising from employment related travel. • The employer is not involved in negotiations or discussions with the credit card company as to the amount or level of benefits under the FFS provided to employees. The employer does no more than give permission or consent for employees to join the scheme. • The employees of the employer join the credit card company's FFS as individual members. • As members of the FFS, employees accumulate points in respect of goods and services purchased with their corporate credit cards. The employees can exchange the accumulated points for goods and services, including free or discounted air travel, with the credit card company or any other person nominated by the credit card company. This Ruling will not apply if the employer is the credit card company providing the benefits under the FFS to its own employees. 2 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of the FBT rules (as defined in section OZ 1(1)), section CI 2(1) will not apply to the entitlement of benefits received by the employees of the employers under the FFS. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 26 July 1999 until 31 July 2002 This Ruling is signed by me on the 26th of July 1999 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/5 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/5 (“the Ruling”). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 95/6 (Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No. 5, November 1995 at page 7 under the heading “Tax treatment of credit card companies’ frequent flyer schemes”). Some formatting changes have been made, and the commentary to the Ruling has been modified to provide further clarification. The Ruling sets out the tax treatment of frequent flyer schemes promoted by credit card companies. This Ruling will not apply where the employer is the credit card company providing the benefits under the FFS to its own employees. A policy statement dealing with the tax treatment of FFS promoted by airline companies appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Five, No. 6, November 1993 at page 2. Legislation Section CI 1 states: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of - ... (h) Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, ... or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee ... and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. “Arrangement” is defined in section OB 1 to mean, unless the context otherwise requires: ...any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect : 4 Application of the Legislation Liability for FBT Under section CI 1, an employer is liable to pay FBT on fringe benefits provided or granted to an employee by the employer. This is not an issue in the Ruling, because the employer is not the person providing the benefit to the employee. However, under section CI 2(1) an employer can be liable for FBT if the employer enters into an arrangement with another person for the provision of fringe benefits to the employer's employees. Section CI 2(1) is an anti-avoidance provision. For it to have any application there must be an arrangement between the employer and the other party (the provider of the benefit), and that arrangement must provide for or grant a benefit to the employee of the employer entering into the arrangement. Members of a credit card company’s FFS Some credit card companies give all cardholders the opportunity to join their FFS. These schemes allow cardholders to accumulate points on the scheme as they charge goods and services to their credit cards. These goods and services may be employment related or may be private in nature. Subject to certain conditions (which vary from scheme to scheme), the cardholders can transfer the points to a participating airline FFS. The cardholder can then exchange the points for discounted or free travel or goods or services, depending on the terms of the particular airline FFS. There will be no FBT liability for the entitlements received if an employee is an individual card holder, even though the employee may charge employment related expenditure to the card that is later reimbursed by the employer. In these instances there is no arrangement between the employer and the FFS provider. Employees holding corporate credit cards If the employee holds a corporate credit card and is able to charge private as well as employment related expenditure to the card, the question of whether the corporate employer is subject to FBT will depend on whether there is an arrangement between the employer and the credit card company. Where such an arrangement exists, and the arrangement between the provider and the employer is for the granting of benefits to the employee, the employer will be liable to FBT on the value of the benefits so received by the employee. Where the entitlement arises as a result of both employment related and private expenditure some adjustment will be necessary to eliminate the portion of benefits arising from the private expenditure. Is there an arrangement? 5 There have been a substantial number of cases in which the courts have considered the application and meaning of the definition of “arrangement”. Briefly, the major cases are: The High Court of Australia in Bell v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 87 CLR 548 considered that an arrangement: ...extends beyond contracts and agreements so as to embrace all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or so as to produce a particular effect. The Privy Council in Newton and others v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 took a similar line when it concluded that: The word arrangement is apt to describe something less than a binding contract or agreement, something in the nature of an understanding between two or more persons - a plan arranged between them which may not be enforceable at law. But it must in this section comprehend, not only the initial plan but also the transactions by which it is carried into effect - all the transactions that is which have the effect of avoiding taxation, be they conveyances, transfers, or anything else. This passage was quoted and approved by Eichelbaum J in the High Court decision in Hadlee and Sydney Bridge Nominees Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155. The Court of Appeal subsequently approved this. The Privy Council considered the meaning of arrangement in the context of the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Act 1971 in New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields Ltd \[1991\] 1 NZLR 257. It concluded that: Arrangement is a perfectly ordinary English word and in the context of section 27 involves no more than a meeting of minds between two or more persons, not amounting to a formal contract, but leading to an agreed course of action. The English Court of Appeal in Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements \[1963\] 2 All ER 807 considered the ordinary meaning of arrangement. It concluded: Though it may not be easy to put into words, everybody knows what is meant by an arrangement between two or more parties. If the arrangement is intended to be enforceable by legal proceedings, as in the case where it is made for good consideration it may no doubt be properly described as an agreement. But the statute clearly contemplates that there may be arrangements which are not enforceable by legal proceedings, but which create only moral obligations or obligations binding in honour..... When each of two or more parties intentionally arouses in the others expectation that he will act in a certain way, it seems to me that he incurs at least a moral obligation to do so. An arrangement is so defined is therefore something whereby the parties to it accept mutual rights and obligations. In Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd 31 ALR 53, the Court considered whether an arrangement could exist when there was a commitment by one party only. It concluded that it would be rare that an arrangement could exist without reciprocity of commitment from the parties to achieve a commercial objective beneficial to each party. To summarise, the courts have identified the following characteristics that indicate the existence of an arrangement: 6 • A meeting of minds on an agreed course of action for a particular purpose (see New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields). • The parties agree to mutual rights and obligations in respect of the course of action to be undertaken (see Re British Basic Slag Ltd’s Agreements). • An arrangement is unlikely to exist when only one party makes a commitment to the proposed course of action (see Trade Practices Commission v Email Ltd 31 ALR 53). The recurring theme in these characteristics is that the parties agree to make a combined effort for a common goal. It is arguable that an agreement for the granting of permission to recruit employees into the FFS, between the credit card company and the employer client, is an arrangement under section OB 1. It is clear that where each party agrees to certain actions there is a “meeting of the minds” (New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board v Apple Fields) and this is sufficient for there to be an arrangement. However, before section CI 2(1) has any application, the “arrangement” between the credit card company and the employer must be “for” the provision of a benefit by the employer to the employee. Is the arrangement “for” the provision of a benefit to the employee? The use of the word “for” in section CI 2(1) is the critical feature of this component. It was interpreted in the case of Patrick Harrison & Co. v AG for Manitoba \[1967\] SCR 274 as imposing a purpose test. In this case, the Court held that “for the extraction of minerals” meant “with the object or purpose of extracting minerals”. This component limits the arrangements that will fall within the ambit of section CI 2(1) by linking the arrangement to the purpose of providing a benefit to the employees. Accordingly, for section CI 2(1) to apply in this situation there must be an arrangement between the credit card company and the corporate employer to provide a benefit to the employees. In this Ruling’s Arrangement the corporate employer has not entered into any contract or other understanding with the credit card company so that employees receive entitlements under the FFS. If the employees obtain a benefit or an advantage from joining the FFS, it is from the contractual agreement between the credit card company and themselves rather than from any arrangement between the company and the corporate employer. It is concluded that any benefit arising from an individual employee’s membership of an FFS is not a “benefit” provided or granted by the employer, nor is it provided by way of an “arrangement” entered into by the employer and the credit card company. 7 However, if there is any form of arrangement between the credit card company and the corporate employer where the benefits pass to employees as a result of that arrangement, there is clearly a provision of a fringe benefit and, accordingly, section CI 2(1) will apply. 8 Examples Example 1 An employee works for a company. She obtains a personal credit card and joins its associated FFS. Under that scheme she can accumulate points as goods and services are charged on the credit card. After the employee accumulates 10,000 points, she can transfer those points, at her option, to any one of a number of airlines’ FFS affiliated to the credit card company’s FFS. Once she accumulates a specified number of points on the airline FFS, she can exchange them for free or discounted travel. In the course of her work she incurs a number of employment related charges on the credit card as well as private expenditure. The employee accumulates points on the credit card FFS for both types of expenditure. She very soon reaches the specified threshold of points, and transfers them to a particular airline FFS, exchanging them for a free trip to Fiji. The company does not have an FBT liability. The receipt of the entitlement under the credit card company’s FFS is because of the contractual arrangement between the credit card company and the employee. No arrangement exists between the employer and the credit card company to provide the employee with entitlements under its FFS. It does not matter that some of the points that give the entitlement result from employment related expenditure. Example 2 The following year the employee obtains promotion in the company and receives a corporate credit card on which she is specified as the cardholder. The credit card is from a different company to that which issued her personal card. This particular credit card company allows cardholders to participate in its FFS. This scheme also allows an accumulation of points as goods and services are charged on the card and a transfer of points, subject to certain conditions, to a participating airline FFS. The employer does not have an FBT liability on any entitlement received by the employee under the credit card company’s FFS. There is no arrangement between the employer and the credit card company to provide entitlements to the employee under the FFS. The employee receives those entitlements because of her contractual relationship with the credit card company. NOTE: The draft ruling and commentary issued for consultative purposes late last year (PU0042) contained Example 3 which described a situation where the Commissioner could decide that there was an arrangement between an employer and a credit card company in respect of an FFS. It has been decided to remove this example as it raises issues beyond the scope of the "arrangement" to this Ruling which is to rule that there is no liability for FBT where there is no arrangement between the respective parties.
1 CAR PARKS PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX EXEMPTION PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 99/6 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 1(h) and section CI 1(q). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the making available by an employer to an employee of a car park that is on land or in a building owned or leased by the employer, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property, and a legal estate or interest in that property. This includes space in a public car park where the space is subject to a lease between the employer and the proprietor of the car park. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • The car park provided by an employer to an employee is excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1(h) by section CI 1(q), and the employer is not liable to fringe benefit tax in these circumstances. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 November 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12th day of August 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/6 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/6 (“the Ruling”). Background A question exists as to whether the provision of a car park by an employer to an employee gives rise to a fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability. The Ruling confirms that an employer- provided car park is not subject to FBT if the car park is provided on land or in a building that the employer owns or leases, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property and a legal estate or interest in that property. (The term “exclusive right” in the Ruling is to be understood as referring not only to a single tenant/lessee situation, but also to the right of several lessees under the same lease agreement to exclude persons other than themselves.) Included is a space in a public car park where that space is subject to such a lease between the employer and the proprietor of the car park. This is because the car park is considered to be part of the employer’s premises. Further information on FBT may be found in Inland Revenue’s Fringe benefit tax guide, IR 409. The statement on page 33 of that guide on staff car parks should be read in the light of the Ruling and this commentary. Legislation Section CI 1(h) defines a fringe benefit to include: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - being, as the case may be, ..., or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; ... Section CI 1(q) excludes from the definition of “fringe benefit” under section CI 1(h): Any benefit (not being a benefit which consists of the use or enjoyment of free, discounted, or subsidised travel, accommodation, or clothing) that is provided by the employer of the employee on the premises of the employer, not being premises that are occupied by the employee of the employer for residential purposes (or that, at any time when the employee is required to perform duties for the employer on premises, not being residential premises of the employee, other than those of the employer, or by any other person on those other premises), where the benefit is enjoyed by the employee on those premises (or, as the case may be, on those other premises). Application of the Legislation Under section CI 1(h), a benefit of “any other kind whatever” received by an employee directly or indirectly in relation to or by virtue of the employee’s employment, is subject to the FBT regime. The granting of a car park by an employer to an employee is a benefit under section CI 1(h) and is prima facie liable for FBT. While Parliament could have excluded all car parks from the FBT regime, it has not done so. However, section CI 1(q) excludes (with 3 certain exceptions) from the definition of “fringe benefit” a benefit that is provided “by the employer of the employee on the premises of the employer” (the “on premises exemption”). Accordingly, it is the phrase “the premises of the employer” that must be considered, and the extent of the exclusion ascertained by reference to those words. As the following discussion reveals, not all car parks are exempt, and a line has to be drawn somewhere between those that are and those that are not. There is no definition of the phrase “premises of the employer” in the Act, and a question arises as to whether those words are restricted to the place in which the employer carries on business, i.e. “business premises”, or whether they are unrestricted in meaning and include all premises. The exemption provided in the Act is not for car parks generally, but for car parks provided on the employer’s premises. This exclusion was provided for fringe benefits because of the complications of administration and valuation that accompany “on premises” benefits. Factors that would have to be addressed would be whether the tax should be based on the nominal capacity of the parking area or the actual utilisation of the benefit provided, the value to be given sealed and unsealed parks, etc. So it was never intended that car parks provided off the premises by way of a licence from a car park proprietor would be exempt from FBT. The benefit in such a case would be simply the cost of the park, but the valuation of a car park provided on the employer’s premises would be more difficult. While it could be said that some leased car parks (those provided by an independent car park proprietor) would be easily valued, in many cases parks on land leased by an employer would present the same problems as parks on land the employer owns. Accordingly one would expect the on premises exemption to cover leased parks as well. “Premises” is defined in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, (1993 Edition) as, “a house or building with its grounds etc. ... .” The word “of” has many meanings, and the same dictionary defines “of” in the sense of possession as: 22 Belonging to (a person or thing) as something that he, she, or it has or possesses, or as a quality or attribute; having a specified relationship to (a person). The term “premises” has been discussed in a number of cases. In Lethbridge v Lethbridge (1861) 30 LJ Ch 388 it was said at page 393: There is no doubt, ... that the word admits of a limited as well as an enlarged sense, and that the context and surrounding circumstances must determine whether it was used in an enlarged or limited sense. Over a century later in the case of Maunsell v Olins \[1975\] AC 373; \[1975\] 1 All ER 16, Viscount Dilhorne expressed the same idea in this way at pages 383 and 19 respectively: “Premises” is an ordinary word of the English language which takes colour and content from the context in which it is used. ... It has, in my opinion, no recognised and established primary meaning. The word was discussed by Edwards J in In re Alloway \[1916\] NZLR 433 at page 443 in relation to the Chattels Transfer Act 1908 where he said: 4 The word “premises” is here used in contradistinction to the word “lands”, and it seems to me to be plain that it is used in its popular sense, of which many illustrations are to be found in Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary. In that sense the word means any place occupied or exclusively used by any person for any purpose. The words “the ‘premises’ of a man engaged in business” signify the place in which he carries on his business. Such premises may be wholly buildings, as in the case of many shopkeepers; or wholly land, as in the case of a timber-yard; or partly buildings and partly land, as in the case of a timber-yard used in conjunction with a large joinery business; ... . In Re Simersall; Blackwell v Bray (1992) 35 FCR 586 at p 591, it was said: The term “of” in \[the relevant statute\] is apt to embrace a connection or association falling short of absolute ownership. Considering the definition of the word “of” first, this indicates that the key in this usage of the word is possession or ownership, and therefore in respect of premises the word “of” indicates that to qualify as “the premises of the employer” there must be a right of ownership or possession. This may be satisfied if the premises are owned and also if they are rented or leased by the employer, since in the case of a lease the lessee obtains exclusive possession. A mere licence (that is, where the employer has permission from some third party to allow it or its employees to enter and occupy land for the purpose of car parking) would not meet this test of ownership or a possessory interest, as a licensee would have no such legal rights, but merely a right to use the premises. It may be difficult to decide in some cases whether there is a lease or a licence, and the nomenclature used by the parties is not decisive. The two factors that need to be considered are whether the legal right of exclusive possession has been given, and the intention of the parties to be inferred from the circumstances and their conduct; Butterworths Land Law in New Zealand by Hinde, McMorland and Sim, (Butterworths 1997) at pages 431 - 435. The creation and nature of a licence is explained in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Fourth Edition Reissue (Butterworths, London 1994) Vol. 27(1) at paragraphs 9 and 10 in the following way: A licence is normally created where a person is granted the right to use premises without becoming entitled to exclusive possession of them, or where exceptional circumstances exist which negative the presumption of the grant of a tenancy. If the agreement is merely for the use of the property in a certain way and on certain terms while the property remains in the owner's possession and control, the agreement operates as a licence, even though the agreement may employ words appropriate to a lease. ... A mere licence does not create any estate or interest in the property to which it relates; it only makes an act lawful which otherwise would be unlawful. So the word “of” in the phrase “the premises of the employer” in section CI 1(q) introduces the requirement that the employer must either own or lease the premises. That is, the employer must have an estate or interest in the property and not merely a right to use it. If he or she does not own the premises in question, there would have to be a lease agreement for that employer to claim the benefit of the exemption provided by section CI 1(q). The phrase “the premises of the employer” in paragraph (q) is not the same as the phrase “grounds over which the employer has some rights”. As far as the interpretation of the word “premises” is concerned, the Commissioner’s view is that in the context of parking facilities and the FBT legislation, “premises” should be interpreted broadly to include land, buildings, and parts of buildings. Therefore, a car park will form part of the premises of the employer where the land or building on or in which it 5 is situated is owned or leased by the employer, and there is an exclusive right to occupy the property, as well as a legal estate or interest in it. Furthermore, the fact that the employer is not carrying on business on the premises owned or leased does not prevent an employer-provided car park from being excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1(h). This means that an area of land owned or leased by the employer that is available for employee parking, although it is located away from the employer’s business premises, would qualify for the exemption. The land need not be adjacent to the business premises. If the car park is in a public parking facility and the employer arranges and pays the proprietor to make available certain parks for the employer’s employees, generally speaking the car parks will be benefits that are subject to FBT. This is because in these circumstances the employer will have a mere licence (that is to say, permission for it and its employees to enter the property for the purpose of parking while the property remains in the owner’s possession and control), rather than a more formal agreement or lease that would entitle the employer to an interest in or exclusive possession of the parking facility or any part of it. Accordingly, it could not be said that the spaces or parks provided would be “the premises of the employer”. This conclusion is consistent with Esso Australia Limited v FCT 98 ATC 4,953 a decision of the Federal Court of Australia. Whilst that case considered whether certain childcare facilities were part of the narrower (and defined) term “business premises ... of the employer” for Australian FBT purposes and the outcome is not relevant in this context, at page 4,958 the judge (Merkel J) said: It seems to me that, ... for the relevant business premises to be those of an employer, the employer must have a right to possession of the premises, at least to the extent necessary to enable the conduct thereon of the relevant recreational or child care facility. It is important to note that there was a lease in existence in Esso, and the licence situation was not discussed. Indeed at page 4,958 of the judgment, Merkel J acknowledged that (even with a lease) the more employers that shared the particular premises, the harder it would be to say that they were premises of a particular employer. Accordingly it is still considered that there is a distinction to be made between premises leased for the purposes of car parking, and premises upon which a person merely has a licence to enter for the purpose of parking a car. Where no specific park is made available, but that person simply parks at any spot available from day to day, the distinction would be even greater. When an employer has a lease agreement, the question will depend on the precise terms of the agreement. If a specific car park space were held under the lease, the exemption would apply. On the other hand, if there is no lease or specific spaces are not allocated under a lease agreement, it is not considered that such car parks are “premises of the employer”. Note: In some cases it may well be that the employer is simply acting on behalf of the employee in arranging and paying for the car park, e.g. the employee arranges his or her own parking but the employer pays the owner of the car park directly. In this situation if the employer simply pays the parking fees on the employee’s behalf, the sums paid are monetary remuneration of the employee. 6 There could conceivably be situations where, although the employer both arranges and pays for the car park, the employer is clearly acting as the employee’s intermediary or agent. The payments by the employer to the car park owner would then come within section EB 1 as being amounts that, although “not ... actually paid to or received by” the employee, are nevertheless “dealt with in the \[employee’s\] interest or on the \[employee’s\] behalf”. In those situations, the parking fees paid to the car park owner would be monetary remuneration of the employee, and taxable accordingly. Comments on technical submissions received Comments received from parties external to Inland Revenue raised objections that the Ruling would be unfair, it would impose further compliance costs on businesses, and would be contrary to Parliament’s intention. These matters have been given serious consideration. The plain meaning of the words “the premises of the employer” would have to be ignored in order to give them a wider interpretation that would extend to premises for which the employer has a licence. Whilst acknowledging that the same practical benefit is received by an employee whether the car park is leased or licensed, the better view of the law, given the words used, is that this expression could not fairly have a construction placed upon it that would include car parks subject to a licence as well as leased car parks. While unfairness and added compliance costs are factors to be taken into account, it is not considered that they outweigh the correctness of this conclusion. Whilst it may be able to be said that Parliament’s intention is unclear, Parliament could have provided a specific exemption for car parks. It has not done so and instead has chosen to make an exemption available for all benefits in general (except travel, accommodation, and clothing) provided on employers’ premises. That being the case, the Commissioner has to apply the test laid down – “the premises of the employer” test - and not some other test. For example the exemption could have been restricted to premises owned by the employer. The test laid down in section CI 1(q) is clearly wider than that, but not specifically wide enough to exempt all car parks. The ordinary meaning of the words used must be interpreted, and that has led to the conclusion that licences are not covered by the exemption. Alternatively, it is arguably possible to interpret the phrase as meaning business premises, but if that is what Parliament meant, it could have said so. Inland Revenue has made a concession in this respect, its publications stating that business premises are not what is considered to be meant by the word “premises”. The Esso decision has been put forward as supporting the view that licensed car parks would qualify as premises of the employer. However, the Esso case concerned leased premises and the Court said that for the relevant business premises to be those of an employer there would need to be a right to possession (at least to the extent necessary to conduct the relevant child care facility). A licence simply does not confer possession, and so the approach taken in this Ruling does not conflict with the Esso case, which is not considered to go as far as commenting on licensed premises. 7 Examples Example 1 During the year ended 31 March 2000, an employer provides some of her employees with car parks on land across the road from the property on which she carries on her business. The employer is the lessee of that land pursuant to a enforceable and written lease agreement. The Commissioner considers that “premises of the employer” includes land leased by the employer. Therefore, the car parks provided by the employer to the employees are excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” by section CI 1(q). No fringe benefit arises. The employer does not have to carry on her business on the leased land for the exclusion in section CI 1(q) to apply. Example 2 During the year ended 31 March 2000, an employer arranges parking at a commercial car park for three of her employees. No particular spaces are designated for them, but the car park owner has an area reserved for pre-sold parking that is limited to the number of such parkers so that there are always three parks available for these employees. The Commissioner considers that “the premises of the employer” does not include the car park or any part of it. It does not form part of the employer’s premises as the car parks are not owned by the employer, and the car park owner has not parted with possession, but still retains control of the park. Another distinguishing feature is the lack of specifically allocated parks. The requisite ownership or possessory interest is not, therefore, present so that the car park can be called the “premises of the employer”. Accordingly, the provision of places at the car park by the employer to the employees is subject to FBT under section CI 1(h). The provision of the car parks is not excluded from the definition of “fringe benefit” under section CI 1(q). Example 3 As in Example 2, the employer arranges parking at the commercial car park for the employees, but the employer is allotted a particular area in the car park (spaces 8 - 10) and the car park proprietor bills the employer direct. The car park is not owned by the employer and no part of it is subject to a rental or lease agreement between the employer and the proprietor of the car park (although the employer occasionally refers to the charges made for the use of the car park as “rent”). Although the employer could say that the ability to exclude others from the designated spaces is significant, this is nevertheless a licence arrangement (regardless of the use of the word “rent”) as the employer does not have an estate or possessory interest in the car park or any part of it, only a personal permission for herself and her employees to enter the land for a stipulated purpose. The occupation of space in fulfilment of that purpose is not intended to negate the owner’s exclusive possession of the car park or even of the designated spaces as would be the case if there were a lease agreement. The car parks are not “premises of the employer”: she merely has rights to use them. Because the owner of 8 the car park remains in possession and retains general control over the premises, the arrangement is simply a contractual licence, outside the FBT exemption in section CI 1(q). Consequently, the employer is liable for FBT on the taxable value of these fringe benefits. Example 4 A company having many employees who use the facilities provided by a nearby commercial car park, decides that it would like to lease the whole of the top floor of the car park. The available area is less than that of the other floors and would suit the requirements of its staff. The owner of the commercial car park agrees to grant a lease to the company, and installs a card access gate to that floor so that only the company’s employees may use the top floor. The written lease agreement provides that the car park owner will perform custodial duties and generally maintain the top floor to the standard of the other areas of the car park. The Commissioner considers that in these circumstances “the premises of the employer” extend to and include the top floor leased from the car park proprietor, and no fringe benefit liability arises by virtue of section CI 1(q).
1 DEBT FORGIVENESS IN CONSIDERATION OF NATURAL LOVE AND AFFECTION PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 (prior to the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section EH 4(6). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the forgiveness by a natural person (in this Ruling referred to as the creditor), including by way of testamentary disposition under a will, of an amount owing under a debt in the following circumstances: 1. The debtor is a relative (for example a father or child, brother or sister, husband or wife (or non-spousal domestic partner), grandchild, niece or nephew) or close friend of the creditor; or 2. The debtor is a trustee or trustees of a family trust, being a fixed trust, where all of the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are qualifying beneficiaries; or 3. The debtor is a trustee or trustees of a family trust, being a discretionary trust, where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are qualifying beneficiaries. Such forgiveness may relate to the whole or a part of the relevant debt, and may be conditional or absolute. This Ruling does not apply to: • A forgiveness of a debt due by a company (including a family company); or • A forgiveness by a trustee of a debt due by one or more of the beneficiaries of the trust; or • A debt forgiveness that forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement subject to section GD 11 or section BG 1. For the purposes of this Ruling, the term “qualifying beneficiary” means: • A relative (for example a father or child, brother or sister, husband or wife (or non-spousal domestic partner), grandchild, niece or nephew, and other 2 descendants or antecedents of the creditor, whether by blood, marriage, non- spousal domestic relationship, or adoption, and whether or not born during the creditor’s lifetime), or close friend of the creditor; or • A fixed trust where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are relatives or close friends of the creditor or are qualifying beneficiaries or a combination of these; or • A discretionary trust where all the beneficiaries, other than default beneficiaries, are relatives or close friends of the creditor or are qualifying beneficiaries or a combination of these; or • A superannuation scheme that is a trust established specifically by its deed to provide retirement benefits to qualifying beneficiaries only. For the purposes of this Ruling, the term “default beneficiary” means: • A person specified as a beneficiary for the sole purpose of their benefiting from the trust only in the event that all the qualifying beneficiaries pre-decease or no longer exist. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Amounts owing under debts forgiven in the circumstances outlined in the Arrangement are, in terms of section EH 4(6), deemed to be paid for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, as referred to in section OZ 1(1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1997 to 19 May 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23rd day of September 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/7 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/7 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling is also dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 96/4A (in TIB Volume Eight, No.10 (December 1996) at page 40 under the heading Debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection). This Ruling (BR Pub 99/7) does not replace BR Pub 96/4A, which applies from the 1997-98 year to 19 May 1999. This Ruling applies for the period 1 April 1997 to 19 May 1999. Under section 91DB(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, this permits taxpayers to rely upon either ruling during the period that both apply. The expiry date for both rulings is 19 May 1999 being the last day prior to the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 having application. That Act provides for a new section EH 5 on debt forgiveness in consideration of natural love and affection. Background The relevant provisions of the accruals rules are sections EH 1 to EH 10. Base price adjustment calculations for financial arrangements are contained in section EH 4. The base price adjustment is effectively a “wash up” calculation of all income or expenditure under a financial arrangement upon the maturity, transfer, or remission of that arrangement. Generally, under section EH 4, any principal, interest, or other amount payable on a financial arrangement that is “remitted” is gross income to the issuer. If the debt is remitted, the issuer is the debtor. This is illustrated by the examples below. Example 1 Creditor lends Debtor $50,000 repayable in two years with $10,000 interest. However, in the second year of the loan Debtor is in financial difficulties. Creditor agrees to accept $50,000 with no interest, in full and final settlement of Debtor’s obligations. The $10,000 interest is accordingly remitted in the second year. Debtor, however, claimed an income tax deduction for $5,000 of the interest in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume Creditor is not a cash basis holder. Debtor’s base price adjustment in the second year effectively results in the recapture of her income tax deduction of $5,000. She has derived gross income of $5,000. Her gross income is calculated as follows: 4 a - (b + c) = $50,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) = - $5,000 (income). (A negative result is income for an issuer.) For Creditor, the holder of the financial arrangement, a bad debt deduction for the $5,000 forgiven would be available if the requirements of section EH 5(1) were satisfied prior to the remission. Example 2 Assume that Creditor made the loan under Example 1 and that Debtor had claimed an income tax deduction of $5,000 in the first year (on an accruals basis). Assume, however, that after the first year, Debtor’s financial difficulties lead the parties to agree that only $40,000 of principal and $10,000 of interest would be repaid in the second year in full and final settlement. If the balance of the interest ($5,000) were deductible by Debtor in the second year, she would have gross income of $5,000 under the base price adjustment. This is because the deductible interest in that year would partly offset her taxable remission income of $10,000. Debtor’s base price adjustment would be: a - (b + c) = $40,000 + $10,000 - ($50,000 + $5,000) = - $5,000 (income). Creditor could only claim a deduction for the remission under section EH 5(2) if she satisfied the requirements of that subsection prior to the remission. Creditor would only be entitled to a bad debt deduction if she carried on a business of holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and was not associated with Debtor. Legislation Section EH 4(6) allows issuers relief from the taxation of remissions for certain intra- family and private debts. It replaced, without material amendment, the former section 64F(7B) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section EH 4(6) Section EH 4(6) states: Where an amount owing under a debt (including any amount accrued and unpaid at the time of the forgiveness) is forgiven by a natural person in consideration of natural love and affection, the amount forgiven shall, for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules, be deemed to have been paid when the amount is forgiven. Application of the Legislation Requirements of section EH 4(6) 5 In summary, for section EH 4(6) to apply: • There must be an amount owing. • It must be owing under a debt. • It may include any amount accrued and unpaid. • It must be forgiven. • It must be forgiven by a natural person. • It must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. The following discusses some of the requirements of the subsection. Debt Section EH 4(6) only applies when there is “an amount owing under a debt”. It is not available for forgiveness of all types of “financial arrangement” that may be subject to the accruals rules. “Financial arrangement” as defined in section OB 1 is a very broad term. For example, it includes sell-back and buy-back arrangements, debt defeasances, and assignments of income. None of these is, in itself, a debt. “Debt” is not defined in the Act. Accordingly, the expression is given its ordinary or common meaning. In legal terms a “debt” is understood to be a liquidated money demand or something recoverable in court by action for debt. A debt is a certain sum due from one person to another, either by record (e.g. court judgment) or in writing. Forgiven An amount under a debt must be “forgiven” for section EH 4(6) to apply. The expression “forgiven” does not necessarily mean the same thing as “remitted” (as defined for accruals rules purposes in section EH 4(9)(c)). “Remitted” includes a wider range of events that are not necessarily forgiveness. These events could include when the issuer has been released from making payments by operation of statute (e.g. the Insolvency Act 1967) or lapse of time (e.g. become statute barred). “Forgiven” is not defined in the Act. The expression must be given its ordinary or common meaning, i.e. the giving up of any claim to restitution or remedy for an obligation. That forgiveness must be a positive act by the creditor (holder) as opposed to a consequence of the operation of statute or the lapse of time. Such forgiveness is normally evidenced by a deed or other document. Partial forgiveness The Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) can apply to a partial debt forgiveness. The subsection applies in broadly the same way as to a full debt forgiveness. It deems the amount forgiven to be paid for the purposes of the base 6 price adjustment calculation. However, a difference is that a partial debt remission does not trigger a base price adjustment, unless it accompanies maturity or transfer of the financial arrangement. Conditional forgiveness If a forgiveness is conditional, it does not occur until the conditions are fulfilled. Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that the amount conditionally forgiven is not deemed paid under section EH 4(6) until the conditions are fulfilled. Natural person The person forgiving the debt (the creditor or holder) must be a “natural person”. The expression “natural person” is a legal term whose meaning is not altered by the Act. It is a human being as opposed to an artificial person (such as a company): Pharmaceutical Society v London & Provincial Supply Assn. (1880) 5 A.C. 857, 869- 870. This commentary sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of “natural person” for deceased persons and for trusts settled by natural persons. In consideration of natural love and affection This requirement of the subsection confines it to family and other private transactions. It does not apply to business or commercial arrangements. The phrase “in consideration of natural love and affection” is another legal concept. It is not further defined in the Act. It is used to describe an action by a person where the motive is induced not by a promise of something in return but by the natural love and affection the person has for another. An action undertaken in consideration of natural love and affection does not entice reciprocation, i.e. there is nothing in return expected from the debtor. Natural love and affection is generally considered to subsist between relatives, such as father and child, brother and sister, husband and wife (or non-spousal domestic partners), uncle and nephew, grandmother and grandchild, great-grandfather and great-grandchild and other descendants or antecedents of the creditor, whether by blood, marriage, non-spousal domestic relationship, or adoption – whether or not born during the creditor’s lifetime. Except as discussed below in relation to trusts, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) requires that the natural love and affection exist between the creditor and the debtor. The Commissioner considers that in some cases it would be possible for natural love and affection to be present outside the family. For example, it could be present between close friends (although not ordinary acquaintances or colleagues). In testing the state of mind of a creditor in establishing the presence of natural love and affection, the Commissioner may look at a number of factors, such as express statements made, past distributions, existing relationships, and future intentions. However, this is by no means a complete list of the factors the Commissioner can take 7 into account in determining whether the creditor has natural love and affection for the debtor. Inland Revenue does not propose to publish detailed rules or guidelines on the degree of relationship necessary to establish natural love and affection. This question can only be considered on a case by case basis. Debt is deemed paid If the requirements of section EH 4(6) are satisfied, the amount of the debt forgiven is deemed paid; including any amount accrued and unpaid on the debt. This consequence is deemed for all purposes within the qualified accruals rules. The main provisions when this deemed payment is relevant are sections EH 4 (base price adjustment) and EH 5 (bad debts). Broadly, the effect for the issuer or debtor is that no taxable remission arises on a base price adjustment. For the holder or creditor, no bad debt deduction is available under section EH 5 because the amount forgiven is deemed paid. Also, any interest or accruals income forgiven is taxable to the holder, for the same reason. Example 3 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 1, but that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4(6) are met. Debtor has claimed a $5,000 interest deduction in the first year. In the second year, rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 1, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000. This is the balance of the interest remitted that is deemed paid. Her calculation would be: a - (b + c) = ($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) = $5,000 (expenditure). (The amount deemed paid, $10,000, is added into item ‘a’.) Creditor is required over the two years to return the $10,000 of interest remitted as gross income under the accruals rules. No bad debt deduction is available for the remission as it is deemed paid. Example 4 Assume that the forgiveness is as in Example 2, but that Creditor and Debtor are closely related (sisters) and that the requirements of section EH 4(6) are met. Rather than $5,000 of gross income as in Example 2, Debtor’s base price adjustment would result in expenditure of $5,000, being the balance of the interest paid. The $10,000 of debt remitted is not taxable to Debtor, as Debtor is deemed to have paid it. Debtor’s calculation would be: 8 a - (b + c) = ($50,000 + $10,000) - ($50,000 + $5,000) = $5,000 (expenditure). Creditor is assessed on the $10,000 interest received. She is not entitled to a bad debt deduction for the remission as it is deemed paid. Testamentary dispositions and trusts Testamentary dispositions The question has arisen as to whether a deceased taxpayer can be a “natural person” for section EH 4(6) purposes. For example, can section EH 4(6) apply to a debt forgiveness by will when the other requirements of that provision are present? The Commissioner considers that the deceased can be a “natural person” and that section EH 4(6) can apply. This is because, under section 24 of the Wills Act 1837 (UK), in relation to the property of the deceased, a will speaks and takes effect from the time immediately prior to the deceased’s death. (The Wills Act 1837 (UK) has been incorporated into New Zealand law.) Accordingly, the Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) will apply to a testamentary debt when its requirements would have been satisfied immediately prior to the deceased’s death. Example 5 Son owes Father a debt of $10,000. Father dies, and his will provides for the debt to be forgiven. Section EH 4(6) applies and Son is deemed to have paid the debt to Father for accruals purposes. Family fixed trusts The issue has also arisen as to whether the forgiveness of debt to a trust may satisfy section EH 4(6). The situation envisaged is when a trust settlor or creditor is a natural person. He or she has natural love and affection for the trust beneficiaries. The trust is a fixed trust (i.e. the trust deed sets out the share or interest that each beneficiary is to take) for beneficiaries. The trust owes the settlor or creditor a debt. The creditor forgives the debt to the trust. The Commissioner considers that the subsection can apply, provided that all the requirements are satisfied. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary to “look through” the trust from the creditor to the beneficiaries in determining whether there is natural love and affection. The presence or absence of that state between the creditor and the trustee, in his or her private capacity, is irrelevant. Similarly, the presence or absence of that state between the trustee and the beneficiaries is irrelevant. 9 The state must exist, or have existed, between the natural person creditor and all of the trust’s beneficiaries (subject to the comments below about certain default beneficiaries). 10 Family discretionary trusts The position is less clear for discretionary trusts when the class of beneficiaries includes persons for whom the settlor or other creditor has natural love and affection. Some parties have argued that a creditor does not have to have natural love and affection for all the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust in order to satisfy the section. The section does not mention “all beneficiaries” but merely provides that there must be natural love and affection. However, in the Commissioner’s view, it is implicit in the words of the section that the debt must be forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection towards all the beneficiaries. This is because the forgiveness, in a discretionary trust, could benefit any of the objects of the trust. If the trustee has power to allocate benefits to beneficiaries for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection such as a company or a charity, this would seem to defeat the clear intention of the section. The Commissioner considers that the subsection will apply in a family discretionary trust situation, provided that at the time the debt is forgiven all of the objects of the trust (subject to the comments below about default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has or would have had natural love and affection, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries. The fact that the terms of the trust may include a power to add objects or beneficiaries for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection will not preclude the section from applying to a forgiveness of debt if that discretion has not been exercised. Family trusts (fixed and discretionary) with default beneficiaries A related question is whether the subsection applies if a trust deed specifies default beneficiaries for whom the settlor does not have natural love and affection. For example, it is common for family trusts to have charities and similar bodies as default beneficiaries in the event that the qualifying beneficiaries pre-decease. There needs to be a legal mechanism whereby the assets of the trust are definitely to be distributed at some point in time. The naming of default beneficiaries to receive trust property if the intended beneficiaries or objects are not alive when the distribution takes place is accepted by the Commissioner as not precluding the application of section EH 4(6), notwithstanding that such default beneficiaries may be persons for whom the creditor does not necessarily have natural love and affection. Therefore, non-qualifying beneficiaries, such as charities, can be default beneficiaries and the section will still apply in a situation of debt forgiveness. Similarities between family companies and family trust arrangements The Commissioner has considered submissions that focus upon the similarities between family companies and family trust arrangements. However, there is clear legal distinction between these chosen vehicles, in that a company has separate legal personality from its shareholders. This was affirmed in the House of Lords case Salomon v Salomon & Co Ltd \[1897\] AC 22. Accordingly, any relationship between the creditor and the shareholders is regarded as being irrelevant in a forgiveness of 11 debt situation. In contrast, a trust is a form of relationship in which one person (the trustee) holds property in his or her own ownership for the benefit of a second party (the beneficiary). The publication Nevill’s Law of Trusts, Wills and Administration in New Zealand refers to Keeton and Sheridan’s definition of a trust as: the relationship which arises whenever a person called the trustee is compelled in equity to hold property, whether real or personal, and whether by legal or equitable title, for the benefit of some persons (of whom he may be one and who are termed beneficiaries) or for some object permitted by law, in such a way that the real benefit of the property accrues, not to the trustees, but to the beneficiaries or other objects of the trust. \[See The Law of Trusts, 10th edition, at page 5.\] In Garrow and Kelly’s Law of Trusts and Trustees, 5th Edition, 1982, a trust is defined as: an equitable obligation under which a person having the control of property is bound to deal with that property either: (a) For the benefit of definite persons (of whom he may himself be one) and any one of whom may enforce the obligation; or (b) For some object or purpose permitted by law. These definitions emphasise that trust property is vested in trustees who control it and manage it for the benefit of the beneficiaries or objects. A trust is the relationship between the trustee and beneficiaries, whereas a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. A forgiveness to a company or other non-natural person is not in consideration of natural love and affection. A number of commentators share this view. For example, the Valabh Committee commented on this issue in its discussion paper issued in October 1991 on the Operational Aspects of the Accruals Regime. The Committee said, at page 37: The Committee is not persuaded that the natural love and affection exemption should be extended to loans made to companies. Where a loan is forgiven, the relationship between lender and shareholders seems too remote to justify such an extension. Further comment is provided in the publication The New Zealand Accrual Regime – a practical guide by Glazebrook and Oliver. The authors say, at page 169: However, a person could not have natural love and affection for companies or other non-natural persons. It is certainly difficult to envisage that the forgiveness of debt owed by a company, whoever the shareholders are, could be in consideration of natural love and affection. In the discussion document Taxation of Financial Arrangements issued in December 1997, the following comments were made in respect of the forgiveness of company debt obligations: • Section EH 4(6) should not be extended to include forgiveness of debts owing by companies whose shareholders were persons for whom the creditor had natural love and affection. 12 • A company has a separate legal identity from its shareholders. In contrast, a trust is a form of relationship in which one person (the trustee) holds property in his or her own ownership for the benefit of a second party (the beneficiary). The property is held according to terms that are dictated by the person who constituted the trust (the settlor). The function of trust law is to enforce the duties implicit in the trust relationship that exists between the trustee and the beneficiary and to provide remedies for a breach of those duties. • A forgiveness of a debt owing by a trust will benefit the beneficiaries of that trust. However, there may be situations where a loan to a company that is subsequently remitted does not beneficially flow through to shareholders – for example, if a company is insolvent, or in loss. • We note that the Valabh Committee, in its 1991 report, was also opposed to extending section EH 4(6) to cover forgiveness of debts owing by companies. Superannuation schemes as trust beneficiaries A superannuation scheme may be one of the beneficiaries of a trust. As long as the superannuation scheme is a trust established specifically by its deed to provide retirement benefits to persons for whom a creditor has natural love and affection, i.e., relatives or close friends, any debt forgiven by the creditor will be deemed to have been paid under section EH 4(6). Charities as beneficiaries Section EH 4(6) will not apply when a charity is a beneficiary (other than a default beneficiary). Natural love and affection cannot be held for a charity. To interpret section EH 4(6) otherwise would be to ignore the plain words of the section. Charities are not set up for specified or named people but with particular purposes in mind, e.g. relief of poverty, whereas a family trust will have specified beneficiaries as objects. Also, Parliament’s intention in enacting the legislation was to provide an exemption for family arrangements – not to deal in any way with the taxation treatment of charities. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Example 6 Mother has established a trust, with her children as beneficiaries as to one-third each. The default beneficiary, if the other beneficiaries pre-decease, is a charity for the promotion of musical education. Mother has sold her business assets to the trust for a debt owed back by the trust of $100,000. Mother forgives the $100,000 debt in consideration of natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. Section EH 4(6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. Although natural love and affection cannot exist in respect of a charity, its presence in the trust as a default beneficiary does not prevent the subsection applying. Example 7 Prior to his death, the deceased established a family discretionary trust under which the only potential beneficiaries are his children. He lent money to the trust to pay for an overseas trip by his children. His will provided for the loans to be forgiven. Section EH 4(6) applies and the trustee is deemed to have paid the debt for accruals purposes. 13 Example 8 A discretionary trust is established whose beneficiaries are the settlor’s children, other family members, and family superannuation schemes. As long as the superannuation schemes are trusts established specifically by their deeds to provide retirement benefits to family beneficiaries only, debts forgiven by the settlor to the trust will fall within the provisions of section EH 4(6) and the Ruling will apply. Example 9 A discretionary trust includes within its objects the children of the settlor, a family company, and a charity. Both the company and the charity receive regular payments from the trust, i.e. they are not default beneficiaries. The Ruling will not apply where debt is forgiven to such a trust. The presence of the company and the charity precludes section EH 4(6) from applying in a debt forgiveness situation. Natural love and affection cannot be extended to a company or a charity. The same position will apply if no distributions are made to the company or charity. Example 10 A trust may have as its beneficiaries family members and a discretionary family trust. Provided that the beneficiaries (apart from default beneficiaries) of the discretionary trust are family members or close friends, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries, the provisions of section EH 4(6) will apply and so too will the Ruling. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Other situations that may arise Situations will arise that fall outside the examples described here. If taxpayers or their agents are uncertain as to whether the Ruling applies in particular circumstances, they should check with their local Inland Revenue office. If the Ruling does not apply to their arrangement, taxpayers can then ask their local Inland Revenue office for a non-binding opinion on the Commissioner’s view of the law as it affects their arrangement. Alternatively, they can apply for a private binding ruling in respect of a particular arrangement. Other situations where section EH 4(6) does not apply The Commissioner considers that section EH 4(6) is not applicable if: • A trustee, acting in his or her capacity as trustee, forgives a debt owed by the trust beneficiaries, in their capacity as beneficiaries, irrespective of a trustee’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee’s natural love and affection arises in his or her personal capacity. It would be improper for the trustee to forgive a debt in consideration of his or her personal natural love and affection for the beneficiaries. The trustee could only forgive in accordance with his or her duties as trustee (as set out in the trust deed). In the statutory context of section EH 4(6), the Commissioner considers that a trustee acting in his or her capacity as 14 trustee is not a natural person. The settlor’s natural love and affection for the beneficiaries would also be irrelevant as the forgiveness would be by the trustee. • The debt forgiveness forms part of a tax avoidance arrangement in terms of a provision such as section GD 11 or BG 1. For example, an individual taxpayer owes a bank an amount under a debt which she cannot pay in full. The individual pays what she can, and the bank, in turn, transfers the balance of the debt to the taxpayer’s spouse for nominal consideration. The spouse forgives the balance supposedly within section EH 4(6). In these circumstances the Commissioner might invoke an anti-avoidance provision such as section BG 1. Submissions received from practitioners and others We received many submissions in response to our initial draft of the ruling and we have adopted some of the suggestions made to us. We set out below how we have dealt with the main issues. Power of resettlement We were asked whether a trust having the power of resettlement will prevent the section from applying. If a trust has the power to resettle, this alone will not prevent the exemption provisions of section EH 4(6) from applying. Provided that a trust currently satisfies the criteria to achieve an exemption, where a resettlement is effected the resulting beneficiary make-up will govern whether a debt forgiven to the trust comes within the section. If the beneficiaries satisfy the criteria, the exemption will apply – the test is whether a debt is forgiven in consideration of natural love and affection. This test is not affected by the ability of a trust to resettle. Power to nominate further beneficiaries Commentators suggested that the fact that a trust may have the power to add further beneficiaries to the trust for whom a creditor could not have natural love and affection should not prevent section EH 4(6) from applying to a forgiveness of debt. We agree with this view. Provided that at the time the debt is forgiven all the beneficiaries (apart from default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has natural love and affection, i.e. the ability to nominate further beneficiaries (other than qualifying or default beneficiaries) has not been exercised, section EH 4(6) will still apply. If, however, there is an intention (at the time of the debt forgiveness) to add such a non- qualifying beneficiary, the Commissioner reserves the right to consider the potential for invoking the anti-avoidance provisions of the Act if the circumstances support this. Degree of relationship Commentators stated that reference in the ruling to “near relatives” and “close friends” was too narrow an interpretation of the objects of a person’s natural love and affection. We agree with this view. The use of the term “near relatives” and the examples given, left unclear the degree of family relationship to which the section 15 applies. The current draft ruling now refers to “relatives”, and expands on the examples, to take into account how a typical family trust makes provision for family members including those not yet born. Classes of beneficiaries Concern has been expressed as to how to differentiate between primary and minor beneficiaries. The Commissioner now considers that, in a family trust situation, the clear words of section EH 4(6) put the focus on beneficiaries of a trust for whom a creditor can have natural love and affection. The section will apply in all instances if the creditor has forgiven a debt owing by a trust where all the beneficiaries (apart from default beneficiaries) are persons for whom the creditor has natural love and affection, i.e. qualifying beneficiaries. Therefore, no distinction is required to be made between primary and minor beneficiaries. Companies and charities It was suggested by commentators that the section required the Commissioner to look through a company in much the same way that one looks through a trust to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner disagrees with this view. In respect of companies, there is a clear legal distinction between a company and its shareholders in that a company has a separate legal personality from its shareholders. Accordingly, any relationship in a forgiveness of debt situation between a creditor and the shareholders is irrelevant. Some parties also suggested that charities should be permitted beneficiaries for the purposes of section EH 4(6) – primarily for perceived policy reasons. For the reasons noted earlier in this commentary, it is the Commissioner’s view that a person cannot have natural love and affection for a charity or other non- natural person. Neither the history nor the wording of section EH 4(6) indicates any legislative intention to deal with charities; concessionally or otherwise.
1 LOCAL AUTHORITY RATES APPORTIONMENTS ON PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS - GOODS AND SERVICES TAX TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 2(1) - definition of “Input tax”, and section 10(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale and purchase of real estate, between a vendor and a purchaser, where the parties to the transaction make an apportionment between them of local authority rates. The rates apportionment is part of the determination of the consideration for the supply of the property. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • A GST registered vendor must charge GST, if the supply of land is subject to GST, on the consideration including the portion of rates payable by the purchaser. • A GST registered purchaser, who is entitled to an input tax deduction in respect of the supply of the land, can also claim an input tax deduction on the portion of rates payable to the vendor. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 18 November 1999 to 31 March 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of November 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/8 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/8, (“the Ruling”). Background Section 5(7) of the GST Act requires local authorities to charge GST on rates. Local authorities generally charge occupiers of land rates in advance under the Rating Powers Act 1988. On sales and purchases of land, sellers can pass on to buyers rates that relate to the period of the buyer’s occupation of the land. Apportionment is normally provided for in sale and purchase contracts. Some confusion exists as to whether the GST inclusive or GST exclusive amount of rates should be apportioned, and whether sellers should seek to recover a GST inclusive amount of rates from buyers. Question 19 in PIB 148 (May 1986) analysed a rates apportionment as involving two transactions for GST purposes: The supply of local authority services for rates was one supply, personal to the seller. The seller was the only party entitled to claim input tax deductions for GST imposed. There was a supply of the land from seller to buyer. A GST registered seller, supplying in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity, must charge GST on the value of supply of the land (including the seller’s outgoings such as apportioned rates) and issue a tax invoice to the buyer. A registered buyer, acquiring the land for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, can claim an input tax deduction for GST charged on the outgoings. This Ruling follows, and expands on, the approach in question 19. Legislation The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Rating Powers Act 1988 make it clear that local body rates (including the GST element) are consideration for supplies personal to the seller, as the person on the relevant local authority roll at the time. GST Act Section 5(7)(a) states: For the purposes of this Act - Every local authority is deemed to supply goods and services to any person where any amount of rates is payable by that person to that local authority. (Emphasis added). Section 5(15) states: 3 Where a dwelling is included in a supply, the supply of that dwelling is deemed to be a separate supply from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. “Consideration” is widely defined in section 2(1) to include: ... in relation to the supply of goods ... to any person, ... any payment made ..., whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods ..., whether by that person or by any other person ... For example, the Court of Appeal in Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,032 held consideration to include money paid in respect of a supply, even if paid by a person other than the recipient of the supply. “Dwelling” is defined in section 2(1) as: “Dwelling” means any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belong thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling. Rating Powers Act Section 121 of that Act states: The occupier of any rateable property shall be primarily liable for all rates becoming due and payable while his or her name appears in the rate records as the occupier of the property The “occupier” under section 2 is, generally, the owner or long-term lessee of the relevant land. Section 122 states: The local authority shall levy each rate by delivering to the occupier a rates assessment ... Every rate shall be deemed to have been levied upon delivery of such an assessment. (4) Delivery of the rates assessment shall be effected before the date on which the rate is due and payable. Section 106 requires the owner (or occupier) and the buyer of the land to notify the relevant local authority of the change in land ownership. However, section 106(7) states: ... the giving of notice under this section shall not release the owner or occupier giving it from liability for any rates due at the time the notice is given. Application of the Legislation The Commissioner considers that apportionments of rates are a part of the consideration for the seller’s supply of land. A sale of land is a supply of goods for GST purposes. As a matter of contract, the seller and buyer can agree to any price for the land (including apportionments). The 4 Commissioner considers that the payment of rates apportionments from the recipient (buyer) to the land supplier (seller) is consideration for that single supply. Rates apportionments are paid in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply of land. Accordingly, the GST treatment of apportionments is the same as the other consideration for the land. The buyer should be able to claim an input tax deduction if he or she is entitled to an input tax deduction for the other consideration. Section 5(15) of the GST Act If the property being transferred is to be used by the purchaser in a taxable activity and the property also includes a dwelling (e.g. a farm or horticultural property), section 5(15) deems the dwelling (as defined: predominantly a place of residence) to be a separate supply from the supply of the real estate. This means that the rates apportionment, since it forms part of the consideration for the land, will be apportioned along with the other consideration for the land, between the dwelling and the land excluding the dwelling. However, where all the property being transferred will form part of, or is used in, the purchaser’s taxable activity, no such rates apportionment is required, e.g. a property developer who acquires land and buildings for the purposes of a development activity. Examples The GST position is illustrated in the land sale examples that follow. Assume in each situation that the local authority charges the seller rates in advance. The apportioned amount of rates is $11.25 (inclusive of $1.25 of GST). This is payable by the buyer to the seller under the agreement for sale and purchase of the land. Example 1 - sale by an unregistered seller to an unregistered buyer This is the situation for most residential property transactions. The seller is unregistered and is not entitled to an input deduction of $1.25 for the rates. In the absence of provision in the Property Law Act 1952 or elsewhere, the amount of the apportionment is a matter for negotiation between the seller and buyer (as to whether the seller recovers the GST component of $1.25. Although the seller could pass on the GST exclusive amount of $10, usually the seller would wish to recover the full $11.25). As the buyer is unregistered, the GST Act does not allow an input tax deduction for any GST element of the rates apportionment. Example 2 - sale by a registered seller to an unregistered buyer For example, a GST registered property developer sells a residential property to an ordinary house buyer. 5 The seller may be able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST component of rates if he or she can satisfy the requirements of section 20(3). Even if those requirements cannot be satisfied, the supply of the land is likely to be in the course or furtherance of the supplier’s taxable activity, and will be a taxable supply on which the seller must charge and return GST output tax. The apportionment will be part of the consideration for that supply. This part of the consideration will presumably be $11.25, including $1.25 of output tax, which the seller must return to Inland Revenue. The GST Act will not allow an unregistered buyer to claim an input tax deduction for the GST element of the apportionment. Example 3 - sale by an unregistered seller to a registered buyer (secondhand goods) For example, a GST registered property developer buys a residential property to renovate and resell. Again the amount of the apportionment is a matter for agreement between the parties. It is likely that the seller would wish to recover the GST on the rates from the buyer, and in these circumstances would charge $11.25. The seller is unable to issue a GST tax invoice to the buyer because the seller is unregistered. The buyer could only claim an input tax deduction of $1.25 under section 20(3) if he or she was entitled to a secondhand goods deduction on the overall property purchase. Example 4 - sale by a registered seller to a registered buyer (at the standard rate) This is the situation for commercial property transactions that are not sales of going concerns under section 11(1)(c). The seller is able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST on rates paid if it has a tax invoice and the local authority goods and services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The seller would return GST output tax on the value of the supply of land (including the apportionments), and would issue a tax invoice to the buyer inclusive of the apportionments. This allows the buyer to claim an input tax deduction for the GST element of the purchase price, provided the property is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Example 5 - sale by a registered seller to a registered buyer (zero-rated) This situation arises when the supply was of land that was a taxable activity, or part of a taxable activity, as a going concern within section 11(1)(c). The seller could claim an input tax deduction for the GST on rates paid if he or she could satisfy the normal tests. In this situation the apportionments on sale should be GST exclusive ($10) rather than inclusive ($11.25), that is consistent with zero-rating the supply of the going concern. 6 Examples of GST tax invoices Following are two examples of GST tax invoices and a settlement statement prepared by the New Zealand Law Society in consultation with Inland Revenue. They are consistent with the Commissioner’s policy in this Ruling. Example 1- registered seller: rates paid in advance Address of vendor and GST number To: Sale of x parcel of land x To: Unused rates apportionment (calculated y on a GST exclusive basis) GST 12.5% on x plus y TOTAL --- Example 2 - registered seller: rates paid in arrears Address of vendor and GST number To: Sale of x parcel of land x To: Amount of rates in arrears (calculated y on a GST exclusive basis) GST 12.5% on x minus y TOTAL --- Example 3 - unregistered seller: rates paid in advance Note: In this situation a GST tax invoice is not required. The seller’s settlement statement could be: Address of vendor To: Sale of x parcel of land x To: Unused rates apportionment (calculated y on a GST inclusive basis) TOTAL ---

Definitions The following definitions are used in this ruling: Distribution means a member’s share of the US LLC’s net profit that is allocated and credited to their capital account and that the Managing Members have resolved to be distributed to a member. Dividend means a dividend as defined in s CD 3. Foreign investment fund (FIF) means a foreign investment fund as defined in s EX 28. Managing Members means the members of the US LLC who are authorised to act on behalf of the US LLC in carrying on the US LLC’s business. Member means a person who has an ownership interest in a US LLC. New Zealand – United States Double Tax Agreement (NZ–US DTA) means the agreement under the Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983. Partnership income means a member’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income that is treated as their partnership income for US federal income tax purposes. United States limited liability company (US LLC) means a limited liability company formed under state law in the US and classified as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes that is not treated as tax resident in New Zealand. The arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: • A NZ investor is one of the members of a US LLC that has not made an election to be taxed as a corporation and is a FIF. • Where the NZ investor is a natural person, they are not a transitional resident, and the cost of their interest in the FIF is greater than $50,000 in a year. 8 • The NZ investor adopts the attributed FIF income method for calculating FIF income. • The exemptions from holding an attributing interest in a FIF set out in ss EX 31 to EX 43 do not apply. • The US LLC makes a distribution to the NZ investor. • The US LLC withholds and pays US federal income tax on the NZ investor’s partnership income. • No US federal income tax is payable on the distribution from the US LLC to the NZ investor. • The US LLC’s operating agreement provides that the Managing Members have the power to make distributions to members of the US LLC in their sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the Arrangement does not include arrangements where subpart BG of the Act applies to void that arrangement. How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The taxation laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The NZ investor will be subject to New Zealand tax on the attributed income from their interest in the FIF under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. • US federal income tax paid for the NZ investor on their US partnership income is creditable against the NZ investor’s FIF attributed income tax liability under s LK 1(1)(d). However, this is only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and the foreign tax credits do not relate to any foreign tax paid on any active income of the FIF. • The distribution from the US LLC to the NZ investor will be a dividend under section CD 1. • Where the NZ investor is a company, any dividends derived by the company from a foreign company are exempt income under s CW 9 unless ss CW 9(2) or (3) apply. • Where the NZ investor is a natural person, they will be taxed on any dividend derived from the US LLC under s CD 1. This individual NZ investor may deduct any US federal income tax paid on their partnership income from any dividend derived from the US LLC under s CD 18. • Under the formula in s CD 18(2), the NZ individual investor is required to take into account the total federal income tax paid on the US LLC interest since acquiring it as well as any refund of US tax received and the amounts of such tax previously deducted under the formula. • An individual NZ investor may choose to be a branch equivalent tax account person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming a foreign tax credit), then the individual NZ investor may claim a branch equivalent tax account tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed FIF income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the net dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. 9 The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning from the date of issue of the Ruling and ending three years from that date.

A United States limited liability company (US LLC) is a hybrid entity formed in the US that has company and partnership characteristics. A US LLC is a company formed by members to hold business assets and conduct a specific business and provides limited liability to its members. These Rulings are focused on US LLCs that are treated as a partnership, where its members are taxed as partners for US federal income tax purposes. 2. For New Zealand tax purposes, a US LLC is a company and is a separate legal entity from its members. As a US LLC owns the business assets and conducts the specific business, the US LLC is treated as deriving the income that it earns from the conduct of that business for New Zealand tax purposes. Although a US LLC has partnership characteristics, a US LLC does not meet the New Zealand legal requirements for being taxed as a partnership. 3. This commentary explains the circumstances when a foreign tax credit (FTC) or other relief is available to a New Zealand investor in a US LLC for US federal income tax paid by them on their “distributive share” 1 of the US LLC’s income. This depends on whether the US LLC is a foreign investment fund (FIF) or a controlled foreign corporation (CFC), and if the US LLC pays a dividend to the New Zealand investor. 4. A New Zealand investor is entitled to claim a New Zealand FTC for US federal income tax paid by them and/or “relief” in terms of s CD 18 or s EX 51 in the three circumstances set out in the Rulings. 5. The first circumstance is where the US LLC is a CFC or a FIF (and the investor adopts the attributable FIF income method) and the New Zealand investor has attributed CFC or FIF income. The New Zealand investor may claim a FTC for any US federal income tax they pay on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income against their New Zealand tax liability on attributed CFC or FIF income. 6. The second circumstance is where the New Zealand investor derives a dividend from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor may deduct any US federal income tax they paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income from that dividend under s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend amount. Where the New Zealand investor is not subject to New Zealand 1 A defined term in the US tax code in relation to partnership taxation (see 26 U.S. Code § 704). 3 tax on the dividend from the US LLC, then the relief provided by s CD 18 does not apply because the dividend is not taxable. This will be the case if the New Zealand investor is a company, because foreign dividends derived by a company are exempt income under s CW 9, and where the New Zealand investor adopts one of the following FIF income calculation methods: fair dividend rate, comparative value, cost method or deemed rate of return. 7. The third circumstance is where the New Zealand investor adopts the comparative value method for their FIF income and includes US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of US LLC income as a cost, a gain and as a reduction of the closing value in the formula in s EX 51(1). 8. A New Zealand investor may also be entitled to relief under the New Zealand–US double tax agreement (NZ–US DTA). 2 However, under the specific facts of the arrangements covered by these Rulings, the specific articles in the NZ–US DTA dealing with relief from double taxation do not apply. 9. This commentary is divided into four main areas where we discuss: (a) What is a US LLC (from \[11\]); (b) the characteristics of a US LLC that make it a company for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[21\]); (c) why a US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[26\]); and (d) why a US LLC is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as deriving the income that it earns from the conduct of the US LLC’s business (from \[29\]). 10. Explanatory examples are included from \[136\]. Abbreviations are listed in the references at the end of the commentary. An Appendix after the references sets out in flow charts how to work out which ruling applies, an overview of the tax treatment of income derived, and then tables of the tax treatment for FIFs and CFCs. What is a US LLC? 11. A US LLC is a hybrid legal entity that is a limited liability company but also has characteristics of a partnership. 3 US LLCs are established at the state level under local state law but are similar in structure across the US. 12. US LLCs have four common features: (a) The US LLC is a separate legal entity from its members. 2 Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983. 3 LLCs with 2 or more members are taxed as partnerships by default unless an election is made to be taxed as a corporation. Single member LLCs are taxed on a flow through basis to that member. When a US LLC is treated as a partnership the members are taxed as partners for federal income tax purposes. The allocation of profits or losses of a US LLC must be made in accordance with the US LLC’s limited liability agreement (also known as the US LLC’s operating agreement). See, for example, § 18-503 of the 2014 Delaware Code. The allocation of the US LLC’s profits to it members and the crediting to their capital account is similar to how profits are allocated and accounted for in a partnership. 4 (b) The business of the US LLC is conducted by the US LLC and not its members. (c) The assets used for carrying on the business of the US LLC are owned by the US LLC and not by its members. (d) The US LLC is liable for the debts incurred as a result of carrying on the US LLC’s business. The members have no liability for the liabilities of the US LLC. 13. The operations of a US LLC are generally governed by an operating agreement. Most operating agreements include an explanation of: (a) each member’s percentage interest in the US LLC represented by their capital account; (b) the members’ rights and responsibilities; (c) how the US LLC will be managed; (d) dissolution procedures; (e) how profits and losses for financial accounting and tax are to be allocated to each member; and (f) rules governing what distribution of a member’s share of the US LLC’s profits is to be made in a particular year. 14. A US LLC is managed by its members or a manager. A manager may be a group of members (Managing Members) or a third party. 15. Ownership in a US LLC is represented by a membership interest rather than by shares. Therefore, a US LLC’s owners are referred to as members rather than shareholders. 16. Generally, profits are allocated to members in proportion to their membership interests as reflected in their capital accounts. However, the operating agreement may specify profit interests for members that are not based on their capital accounts. This mirrors partnerships that may include differential profit-sharing arrangements for members to reflect risk and reward. 17. The distributive share of the US LLC’s income on which a member pays US tax is their share of the profits as determined by the operating agreement adjusted, as necessary, to meet the US tax requirements. As such, it may differ from a proportional share of the net accounting income or the specified profit share, as the case maybe. 18. A member’s capital account is essentially a measure of a member’s equity in a US LLC. It is generally added to by contributions the member has made and by the member’s share of profits. The capital account is debited by any share of loss and by any distributions taken by the member. 5 19. For US federal income tax purposes, a US LLC with multiple members is treated and taxed as a partnership unless an election is made to be taxed as a corporation. 4 Each member of a US LLC pays tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income, which is reported on the member’s individual US federal income tax return. 5 The US LLC files a federal partnership return, and the individual member must include their distributive share in their personal federal income tax return. 6 20. A US LLC is required to withhold tax from US sourced profits allocated to non- resident members. Different rates apply depending on the income category but commonly 30% is withheld. Since a member has already paid tax on their share of the US LLC’s taxable income, the member generally pays no further US tax when the US LLC distributes that income to them. However, further US tax would be payable if, for example, the member was distributed an amount in excess of their capital account. When a member files their US tax return they may receive a refund of US tax, for example, if the NZ-US DTA reduces the applicable rate on the type of income from that withheld by the US LLC. Characteristics of a US LLC that make it a company for New Zealand tax purposes 21. The word “company” is defined in s YA 1. Company (in part): (a) means a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether it is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere: (ab) does not include a partnership: 22. In S Watson and L Taylor (eds), Corporate Law in New Zealand (online ed, Thomson Reuters, 2019), the authors note the attributes of the modern New Zealand company in the following terms (at \[16.1.2\]): As a species of corporation, the modern company has the following traditional and modern corporate attributes: (1) It has perpetual succession. Until dissolved, a company continues to exist and survives the death of its directors and shareholders. (2) It owns its property. The assets of a company do not belong to the shareholders. The only interest which they have in the assets of the company is indirectly through the medium of their shares. They have no proprietary rights to the underlying assets. Similarly, creditors of the company are not creditors of the shareholders. The creditors must claim against the company, and it is only if the company is in liquidation and there is some evidence of use of the corporate form to evade obligations that claimants may possibly have recourse against the shareholders. (3) As a separate legal person, the company can transact and can sue or be sued in its own name. 4 Taxation of Limited Liability Companies (Publication 3402, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, 2016) provides that a US LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 5 The US Internal Revenue Code, § 701, states that partners are liable to tax and not the partnership. Each member must file an annual federal income tax return. 6 As the US LLC is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, the US LLC must file a federal partnership return reporting the taxable income of the partnership computed in terms of § 703 of the Internal Revenue Code (US). However, it is the partners who are liable to income tax and not the partnership: § 701 of the Internal Revenue Code (US). 6 (4) The liability of the shareholders of a limited company is usually limited. Shareholders are only liable for the amount unpaid on their shares. (5) As a consequence of limited liability, the capital of the company is locked in creating entity partitioning or strong form entity shielding. (6) As the price of incorporation, the company must comply with the formalities of the Act. This requires payment of the registration fee, and the regular filing of documents and accounts with the Registrar of Companies. These are the costs of transacting business in this particular way. 23. A US LLC meets the definition of a company for New Zealand company and tax law purposes for six main reasons: (a) A US LLC is a legal entity that comes into existence by the execution of a certificate of formation. 7 It remains in existence until it is dissolved. (a) The assets used for carrying on the business of the US LLC belong to the US LLC and not its members. 8 (b) The US LLC (and not the members) is liable for the debts incurred as a result of carrying on the US LLC’s business. The members have no liability for the liabilities of the US LLC. (c) The liability of a member of a US LLC is limited to their capital contributions as defined in the US LLC’s operating agreement or, where there is no operating agreement, under state law. 9 (d) A US LLC’s operating agreement generally specifies how a US LLC will be dissolved and how assets will be allocated to members. In a US LLC, initial capital and retained profits are largely locked in. (e) Fees and formalities need to be paid and satisfied to create a US LLC in the US. 24. Alternatively, a US LLC could be an “other entity that has a legal existence separate from that of its members, whether incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere”. 25. A US LLC is an entity that has a separate legal existence from its members and is incorporated or created in the US. Why a US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes 26. Section YA 1 provides that a company does not include a partnership. 27. A “partnership” is defined in s YA 1 to mean a partnership as described in s 4(1) of the Partnership Act 1908. Section 4 of the Partnership Act 1908 defines a partnership as the relationship that “subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view to profit”. 7 For example, § 18-201 of the LLC Act (Delaware) provides that a company formed under that Act is a separate legal entity until the cancellation of the company’s certificate of formation. 8 For example, § 18-701 of the LLC Act (Delaware) provides that members have no interest in specific property of the LLC. 9 For example, § 18-502 of the LLC Act (Delaware) states that a member is obligated to an LLC to make their promised cash, property or service contributions. 7 28. A US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes because it is the US LLC that carries on the business and not the members of the US LLC. Why a US LLC is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as deriving the income it earns from the conduct of the US LLC’s business 29. A company is a separate legal entity and, for New Zealand tax purposes, is a separate taxpayer from its shareholders. Where a taxpayer owns business assets and carries on a business, then the income from that business is derived by that taxpayer. Section CB 1 states that “an amount that a person derives from a business is income of the person”. 30. Although in the context of the Rulings, the US LLC is not a New Zealand taxpayer, the scheme of the Act, as far as business owners are concerned, applies to a US LLC. Accordingly, a US LLC that is a separate legal entity and owns the assets and conducts the business of the US LLC, will be treated as deriving any income it earns from the business activities conducted by it for New Zealand tax purposes (that is, the income will not be treated as derived by the members of the US LLC). 31. Consequently, a New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be subject to New Zealand tax on dividends derived from the US LLC and/or any FIF income or attributed CFC income, where the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. The New Zealand income tax consequences for a New Zealand investor in a US LLC are discussed next. How a New Zealand resident investor is taxed on income derived from a US LLC 32. A New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be subject to New Zealand tax on dividends derived from the US LLC and/or any FIF income or attributed CFC income, where the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. 33. In the following paragraphs, we discuss: (a) what a dividend is for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[34\]); (b) when a dividend is derived for New Zealand tax purposes (from \[39\]); (c) what is a dividend in the US LLC context (from \[40\]); (d) the application of the FIF regime to investments in a US LLC (from \[49\]); and (e) the application of the CFC regime to investments in a US LLC (from \[73\]). What a dividend is for New Zealand tax purposes 34. Section CD 1 states that a “dividend derived by a person is income of the person”. Section CD 3 provides that ss CD 4 to CD 20 define what a dividend is. 35. Section CD 4(1) provides: CD 4 Transfers of company value generally Transfers of company value from company (1) A transfer of company value from a company to a person is a dividend if— 8 (a) the cause of the transfer is a shareholding in the company, as described in section CD 6; and (b) none of the exclusions in sections CD 22 to CD 37 applies to the transfer. 36. Section CD 5(1) provides: CD 5 What is a transfer of company value? General test (1) A transfer of company value from a company to a person occurs when— (a) the company provides money or money’s worth to the person; and (b) if the person provides any money or money’s worth to the company under the same arrangement, the market value of what the company provides is more than the market value of what the person provides. 37. Section CD 6(1) expands on s CD 5(1): CD 6 When is a transfer caused by a shareholding relationship? General test (1) A transfer of company value from a company to a person (the recipient) is caused by a shareholding in the company if— (a) the recipient at any relevant time— (i) holds shares in the company; or (ii) is associated with a shareholder; and (iii) \[Repealed\] (b) the company makes the transfer because of that shareholding of the relevant shareholder. 38. In summary, a dividend is a transfer of company value (the provision of money or money’s worth) to a person from a company where that transfer in value is because of that person’s shareholding (for example, the payment of a dividend to a shareholder in a publicly held company). When a dividend is derived for New Zealand tax purposes 39. A dividend is not income of a person unless it is also derived by that person for New Zealand tax purposes. The arrangements to which these Rulings apply assume that the New Zealand investor is a cash-basis or an accruals-basis taxpayer. A dividend is derived for both types of taxpayers when the income is credited to the taxpayer’s account or in some other way dealt with in their interest or on their behalf, even if it is not treated as derived by them under common law: s BD 3(4). What a dividend is in the US LLC context 40. A US LLC’s operating agreement will specify how the annual net accounting profits or losses of the US LLC are allocated to its members and any profit sharing arrangements that depart from a member’s percentage ownership interest . 10 10 Where there is no term in the operating agreement or no operating agreement, then, generally, the US state law on which the US LLC was created will contain a default rule for the allocation of accounting profits or losses to its members. For example, § 18-503 of the 2014 Delaware Code 9 Generally, a proportional share of net profits or losses or the specified profit share are credited or debited to a member’s capital account, and any subsequent distribution is debited to the member’s capital account. 41. A US LLC’s operating agreement will also contain rules for when amounts in a member’s capital account will be distributed or held in reserve to meet expected or contingent liabilities. 42. The allocation and crediting to a member’s capital account of the member’s share of the US LLC’s profits is a “dividend” as defined in ss CD 4 and CD 5 for New Zealand tax purposes, as it is a transfer of value (the provision of money or money’s worth) by the US LLC to a member and the cause of transfer is the member’s “shareholding” in the US LLC. 43. A dividend will be derived by a member when the member has a right to access their share of profits credited to their capital account. This will commonly coincide with the Managing Members of the US LLC (or other person authorised to make that decision) resolving to distribute funds to a member and when the funds are placed outside the control of the Managing Members. 44. The time when funds are placed outside the control of the Managing Members depends on the rules relating to distributions in a particular US LLC’s operating agreement. For example, where distributions to a member from the member’s capital account are at the sole discretion of the Managing Members (or those authorised to make the decision), then the dividend will be derived by a member at the time the Managing Members resolve to make a distribution to a member and the member can access the funds. In these circumstances, the Managing Members have formally parted with control of the funds, and the member can access those funds as they wish. 45. On the other hand, where a member of a US LLC is able to withdraw their share of the US LLC’s profits from their capital account (subject to cash being available) because the US LLC’s operating agreement provides for mandatory distributions, then the dividend will be derived for New Zealand tax purposes at the time of crediting to the member’s capital account. Examples 1 and 2 explain the practical effects of this difference (the examples start at \[136\]). 46. The Commissioner’s approach is consistent with the High Court decision in CIR v Albany Food Warehouse (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532. The court in Albany was required to consider when amounts credited to a shareholder’s current account should be treated as paid to them for New Zealand tax purposes. The court concluded the amount was paid if it was placed outside the directors’ control as a result of the directors’ resolution declaring the dividend and crediting the dividend to the shareholder’s current account. The court distinguished the facts of Albany with those in Alliance Group Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,066 where the High Court had concluded that there had not been a payment at the time of crediting to the account of the taxpayer, because the taxpayer did not have the right to draw on the funds in the account. 47. The Rulings assume that distributions from a member’s capital account are at the sole discretion of the Managing Members, and that a member will be able to access funds in their capital account only once the Managing Members have resolved to provides that in the absence of a term in the operating agreement, profits or losses should be allocated on the basis of the agreed value of the contributions made by each member. 10 distribute the funds. In such circumstances, a dividend will be derived for New Zealand tax purposes by a member at the time of distribution to that member. 48. The circumstances, and how a dividend derived by a New Zealand investor in a US LLC will be taxed, depends also on whether the US LLC is a FIF or a CFC. The application of the FIF and CFC rules, s CD 18 and New Zealand’s FTC rules are discussed next. Application of the FIF regime to investments in a US LLC 49. An investment in a US LLC by a New Zealand investor will be an investment in a FIF (unless it is a CFC) and the FIF rules will apply. 50. Section EX 28 defines a FIF as including a “foreign company”. As discussed earlier, s YA 1 defines a “company” to include a body corporate or other entity that has a legal existence separate from its members, whether incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere. Section YA 1 in turn defines a “foreign company” as a company that is not resident in New Zealand. A US LLC is a company for New Zealand tax purposes, and it is assumed that for the purposes of these Rulings the US LLC is not tax resident in New Zealand. 51. A New Zealand investor in a US LLC that is a FIF will be subject to tax on FIF income if they hold an “attributing interest” in the FIF as described in s EX 29 and none of the FIF exemptions in ss EX 31 to EX 43 apply. One category of attributing interest that is relevant to an interest in a US LLC is a direct income interest as described in s EX 30(1): EX 30 Direct income interests in FIFs Categories of direct income interest (1) A person has a direct income interest in a foreign company at any time if they hold— (a) any of the shares in the foreign company: (b) any of the shareholder decision-making rights for the company: (c) a right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of the company for the accounting period in which the time falls: (d) a right to receive, or to apply, any of the value of the net assets of the company, if they are distributed. 52. Shares in a foreign company are a direct income interest: s EX 30(1)(a). A “share” is defined in s YA 1 to “include any interest in the capital of a company”. A member’s ownership in a US LLC is represented by their membership interest in the LLC (generally in proportion to their capital contributions to the LLC) rather than shares. A member’s capital account generally includes initial capital, any additional capital and the allocation of the net accounting profits or losses of the US LLC to its members less distributions made. A member’s interest of a US LLC in their capital account is considered an “interest in the capital of the company” and is a “share” for New Zealand tax purposes. 53. A right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of a foreign company for an accounting period in which the time falls is also a direct income interest: s EX 30(1)(c). A US LLC operating agreement may specify a profit interest of each member. In these circumstances, the percentage of a US LLC’s profits allocated to a member’s capital account is based on the profit interest specified in the operating agreement rather than based on the member’s capital interest that is reflected by 11 their capital account balance relative to the total capital of the US LLC. A member’s profit interest in a US LLC is considered a “right to receive, or to apply, any of the income of a foreign company for an accounting period in which the time falls” for New Zealand tax purposes. 54. In summary, a member’s interest or profit interest in a US LLC can be a direct income interest, so is an attributing interest in a FIF. In these circumstances, a New Zealand investor who is a member of a US LLC will be subject to tax on FIF income (subject to exemptions). It is assumed for the purposes of the Rulings that none of the FIF exemptions in ss EX 31 to EX 43 apply. Similarly, it is assumed that the member is not a transitional resident who is not taxed in New Zealand on certain foreign-sourced income. 55. The FIF rules apply to the following arrangements, as set out in the Rulings. Where the cost of the New Zealand investor’s interests in FIFs is $50,000 or less 56. A natural person and trustees for a limited variety of trusts holding an interest in a FIF will not have FIF income if the cost of the FIF interests they hold does not exceed $50,000 at any time in a year: s CQ 5(1)(d). 11 This assumes the person has not opted to include FIF income despite their FIF interests being less than the threshold. The New Zealand investor will be taxed on only the actual dividends derived from the US LLC (and from any other FIF interests they hold) under s CD 1 and is not required to calculate income under the FIF rules under s CQ 5(1)(d). 57. Section CD 18 applies to provide a deduction for any US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor against any dividend derived from the US LLC. Section CD 18(2) includes a formula that requires factoring in any prior deductions claimed for US federal tax since inception of the investment in the US LLC. This is explained in more detail from \[106\]. 58. No FTCs are available to be claimed against the New Zealand tax on any dividend derived from the US LLC because no US tax is paid at source on the distributions. 59. A New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the NZ–US DTA) for US federal income tax on “partnership” income against their New Zealand tax liability on dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not paid on the dividend distribution from the US LLC. However, the s CD 18 deduction gives a similar overall effect, albeit as a different way of recognising the US tax paid by the New Zealand investor. For a detailed example, see examples 1 and 2 (the examples start at \[136\]). 11 If the person is a trustee, the requirements of s CQ 5(1)(e) must be met broadly restricting eligibility to testamentary trusts of a person within five years of death, certain court-ordered trusts, and trusts settled by the Accident Compensation Corporation. 12 Where the US LLC is a FIF and the FIF income is calculated by applying the fair dividend rate, comparative value, cost method or deemed rate of return 60. Subject to the $50,000 FIF “exemption”, a New Zealand investor who has an attributing interest must pay New Zealand tax on their FIF income. The five methods for calculating FIF income are the: 12 (a) fair dividend rate (FDR); (b) comparative value (CV); (c) cost method (CM); (d) deemed rate of return (DRR); and (e) attributable FIF income method (AFIM). 61. Where a New Zealand investor in a US LLC adopts any of the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FIF income calculation methods, the resulting amount from applying that method is FIF income. Any FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods is a substitute for any actual income derived by a New Zealand investor in the FIF. To avoid double taxation, any actual income derived by a New Zealand investor from a FIF (for example, dividends) who adopts any one of the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B (that is, it is not assessable income). 62. Additionally, s CD 36 provides that where a person adopts any of the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation methods, any actual dividends derived from the FIF are “not a dividend”. Section CD 36(1) states: CD 36 Foreign investment fund income Amount not dividend (1) An amount paid by a company to a person is not a dividend if, — (a) at the time the person derives the amount, the person’s interest in the company is an attributing interest, or would have been if the company had not been liquidated; and (b) the person calculates their foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss in relation to the interest and the period in which the amount is paid under— (i) the comparative value method: (ii) the deemed rate of return method: (iii) the cost method: (iv) the fair dividend rate method; and (c) \[Repealed\] (d) the amount is excluded income under section CX 57B (Amounts derived during periods covered by calculation methods). 63. The effect of s CD 36 excluding an amount derived from a foreign company from being a dividend is that s CD 18 does not apply to a New Zealand investor in a FIF who adopts any of the FDR, CV, CM or DRR calculation methods. Section CD 18 provides relief for New Zealand investors in foreign hybrid entities by allowing a deduction for foreign tax paid against a foreign-sourced dividend derived from the 12 The Rulings do not consider the branch equivalent and accounting profits method that were available for use for income years beginning on or before 30 June 2011. 13 hybrid entity. Section CD 18 cannot apply if there is no dividend (which is the effect of s CD 36). 64. Also, a New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the NZ–US DTA) for US federal income tax on their distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not foreign tax paid on FIF income. 65. For a detailed example, see example 3 (the examples start at \[136\]). 66. Relief is however available for US federal income tax paid on a NZ investor’s distributive share if that investor has adopted CV to calculate their FIF income. Under s EX 51(1) there is a formula for calculating CV income. The formula is increased by “gains” and decreased by “costs”. Payment of US tax on behalf of the NZ investor will be a gain as defined in s EX 51(4)(b). “Costs” in the formula are defined in s EX 51(6)(b) as including foreign income tax paid by the person on their FIF income in that income year. The gain is however offset by the fact that US tax withheld is debited to the NZ investor’s capital account reducing their “closing value” in the formula which is defined in s EX 51(3). The net result is that the payment of US tax will reduce their FIF income. Where the US LLC is a FIF and the investor adopts the AFIM 67. In general terms, a New Zealand investor in a FIF may adopt the AFIM for calculating their FIF income, provided the New Zealand investor can: (a) give the Commissioner (if requested) sufficient information to enable the Commissioner to check the calculations required by s EX 50; and (b) the FIF is a foreign company; and (c) the person has a 10% or more income interest in the FIF; and (d) the foreign company is not a CFC, unless it is a CFC that does not have a readily available market value except one calculated by independent valuation and certain other conditions apply: s EX 46(3)(b). 68. A New Zealand investor will, generally, be subject to tax on any dividends derived from the FIF and any FIF income calculated by applying the AFIM. 69. The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the FIF’s income under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. 70. US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s income tax liability on attributed FIF income: s LK 1(1)(d). \[Note that this is only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and the FTCs do not relate to any foreign tax paid on any active income of the FIF.\] 71. There are three New Zealand tax consequences where dividends are derived from the US LLC: (a) Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. No FTCs are claimable. 14 (b) If the New Zealand investor is an individual, a dividend will be income under s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income from the dividend derived from the US LLC: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend. (c) An individual New Zealand investor may choose to be a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming FTC), then the individual investor can claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed FIF income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the net dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. 72. For a detailed example, see example 4 (the examples start at \[136\]). Application of the CFC regime to investments in a US LLC 73. A CFC is defined in the Act as a foreign company controlled by New Zealand residents. A US LLC is a company and will be a “foreign company” provided it is not resident in New Zealand. 74. The US LLC will be “controlled” by New Zealand residents if, for example, a group of five or fewer New Zealand residents has a total control interest of more than 50% in any one of the control interest categories. 75. In general terms, a New Zealand investor will have attributed CFC income in a US LLC (which is a CFC) if they have an income interest in the CFC of 10% or more, the CFC has “net attributable CFC income”, and the CFC is not a non-attributing active CFC. Where the US LLC is a CFC 76. In summary, the New Zealand tax consequences for a US LLC that is a CFC is as follows (which is the same as the tax consequences for a New Zealand investor in a FIF where the investor adopts the AFIM): (a) The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand tax on their share of attributed CFC income under ss CQ 1 and CQ 2. (b) Any US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s CFC attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this is only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the CFC attributed income and the FTCs do not relate to any foreign tax paid on any active income of the CFC. (c) A distribution from the US LLC is a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: (i) If the investor is an individual, any dividends are assessable to the investor under s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income from the dividend derived from the US LLC: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend. (ii) An individual investor can choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). 15 (iii) Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by the company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. 77. For a detailed example, see example 5 (the examples start at \[136\]). Where the US LLC is a FIF that is a non-attributing active FIF 78. Where a New Zealand investor applies the AFIM, they may also apply the active business exemption. In simple terms, a FIF will satisfy the active business exemption where it has attributable income (income from “passive” sources) that is less than 5% of the FIF’s gross income. Where the active exemption applies, the New Zealand investor in the FIF is treated as having an exemption for holding a non-attributing active FIF interest: s CQ 5(1)(c)(xv). In these circumstances, an individual New Zealand investor will be taxed in New Zealand only on any dividend derived from the US LLC. The New Zealand investor may deduct any US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income from the dividend derived from the US LLC: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend. 79. On the other hand, a corporate New Zealand investor is not subject to New Zealand tax, because dividends from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9(1). 80. For a detailed example, see example 6 (the examples start at \[136\]). Where the US LLC is a non-attributing active CFC 81. Where the US LLC is a non-attributing active CFC, then the tax consequences are the same as described at \[78\] to \[80\] for a non-attributing active FIF. 82. There is no attributed income from the CFC under s CQ 2(1)(h). 83. A New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax only on dividends derived from the US LLC as follows: (a) If the investor is an individual, any dividends are assessable to the individual investor under s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income from the dividend derived from the US LLC: s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend. (b) Where the investor is a company, any dividends derived by the company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. No FTCs are claimable. 84. For a detailed example, see example 6 (the examples start at \[136\]). What foreign taxes a New Zealand investor pays in respect of a US LLC are creditable against the investor’s FIF income, CFC income or dividend tax liability 85. Several FTC provisions may apply to a New Zealand investor in a US LLC in this context: 16 (a) Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) set out the general rule for claiming an FTC where foreign tax has been paid on a New Zealand investor’s foreign-sourced income, which is also subject to New Zealand tax. (b) Section LJ 2(6) and (7) sets out a special rule for claiming an FTC where the New Zealand investor adopts one of the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FIF income calculation methods. Foreign tax paid on actual foreign-sourced dividends may be claimed against the New Zealand tax liability on the FIF income derived by a New Zealand investor. (c) Section LK 1 sets out the FTC rules that apply to a New Zealand resident investor with attributed income from a CFC or a FIF where they have adopted the AFIM. Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) – general rule 86. Sections LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) provide the general rule that a person is entitled to a tax credit for foreign tax paid against their New Zealand income tax liability in relation to foreign-sourced income. They also set out how to calculate the New Zealand tax applicable on that foreign-sourced income. 87. Section LJ 1(1) and (2)(a) provide: LJ 1 What this subpart does When tax credits allowed (1) This subpart provides the rules for dividing assessable income from foreign- sourced amounts into segments and allows a tax credit for foreign income tax paid in relation to a segment of that income. Limited application of rules (2) The rules in this subpart apply only when— (a) a person resident in New Zealand derives assessable income that is sourced from outside New Zealand; \[Emphasis added\] 88. Section LJ 2(1) to (3) provide: LJ 2 Tax credits for foreign income tax Amount of credit (1) A person described in section LJ 1(2)(a) has a tax credit for a tax year for an amount of foreign income tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income, determined as if the segment were the net income of the person for the tax year. The amount of the New Zealand tax payable is calculated under section LJ 5. Limitation on amount of credit (2) The amount of the person’s credit in subsection (1) must not be more than the amount of New Zealand tax payable by the person in relation to the segment calculated under section LJ 5(2), modified as necessary under section LJ 5(4). Amount adjusted (3) The amount of the person’s credit in subsection (1) may be reduced or increased if either section LJ 6 or LJ 7 applies. \[Emphasis added\] 89. A “segment of foreign source income” is defined in s LJ 4 as “a person has a segment of foreign-sourced income equal to an amount of assessable income 17 derived from 1 foreign country that comes from 1 source or is of 1 nature”. For example, a dividend derived by a New Zealand investor from a US LLC would be a segment of foreign-sourced income because it is an amount of assessable income derived from one foreign country (the US) that comes from one source (the US LLC) or is of one nature (a dividend). 90. A New Zealand investor may claim a FTC against New Zealand tax payable on that foreign-sourced dividend, for an “amount of foreign tax paid” on that segment of foreign-sourced income. The FTC claimable by the New Zealand investor cannot exceed the New Zealand tax payable in relation to the foreign-sourced dividend: s LJ 2(2). 91. Section LJ 2(1) and (2) do not apply to the arrangements in the Rulings for two reasons. 92. The first reason is that no US tax is paid on the dividend distributions (segment of foreign-sourced income) that are taxed in New Zealand. 93. The second reason is that a New Zealand investor pays US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. However, this cannot be claimed as a FTC against the New Zealand investor’s dividend income derived from the US LLC, because that foreign tax is not paid “on” that segment of foreign-sourced income under s LJ 2(1). In other words, a dividend derived by a New Zealand investor from a US LLC and the New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income are different segments of foreign-sourced income. A New Zealand investor cannot claim a FTC for foreign tax paid on a segment of foreign-sourced income (US federal income tax on a New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income) against the New Zealand tax liability on a different segment of foreign source income (a dividend derived from the US LLC). 94. The application of the NZ–US DTA is considered at \[118\] to \[125\]. Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA operates in essentially the same way as ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) by permitting a FTC for foreign tax paid but only on the same income, for example, a foreign-sourced dividend taxed in New Zealand and in the US. Section LJ 2(6) and (7) – special rule 95. Section LJ 2(6) and (7) provides: When subsection (7) applies (6) Subsection (7) applies to a person who derives an amount from an attributing interest in a FIF when the amount is treated as not being income under section EX 59(2) (Codes: comparative value method, deemed rate of return method, fair dividend rate method, and cost method). Tax credit (7) The person has a tax credit under this subpart for foreign income tax paid on or withheld in relation to the amount. The calculation of the maximum amount of the tax credit is made under section LJ 5(2), modified so that the item segment in the formula is the amount of FIF income from the attributing interest that the person derives in the period referred to in section EX 59(2). 96. Any FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods is a substitute for actual income derived by a New Zealand investor in the FIF. To avoid double taxation, any actual income derived from a FIF by a New Zealand investor 18 who adopts any one of the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B (that is, it is not assessable income). 97. Notwithstanding this “exemption”, the special rule in s LJ 2(6) and (7) provides that any foreign tax paid on such actual income derived by a New Zealand investor may be credited against a New Zealand investor’s New Zealand tax liability on FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods. For example, if a New Zealand investor derives a foreign-sourced amount that has been subject to foreign tax, then the New Zealand investor can claim a FTC under s LJ 2(6) and (7) against their New Zealand tax lability on FIF income calculated under the FDR, CV, CM or DDR calculation methods (but not exceeding the New Zealand tax applicable on the FIF income: s LJ 2(2)). 98. However, ss LJ 2(6) and (7) do not apply to the distributions from the US LLC in the context of the arrangements in the Rulings, as no US tax is paid on the distributions from the US LLC that are dividends for New Zealand tax purposes. Sections LJ 2(6) and (7) also do not apply in relation to any US federal income tax paid by a New Zealand investor in a US LLC on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. That “partnership” income is not income derived by the New Zealand investor for New Zealand tax purposes. Subpart LK – CFC and FIF income 99. Where a person has attributed CFC income or applies the AFIM to their FIF interest, then that person is entitled to a FTC against their New Zealand CFC or FIF income tax liability as determined in s LK 1. 100. Section LK 1(1) provides: LK 1 Tax credits relating to attributed CFC income Amount of credit (1) A person who has an amount of attributed CFC income for an income year has a tax credit for the tax year corresponding to the income year equal to the following amounts paid or payable in relation to the attributed CFC income: (a) an amount of income tax paid by the CFC from which the income is derived: (b) an amount of tax withheld and paid on behalf of the CFC from which the income is derived: (c) the amount of foreign income tax paid by the CFC from which the income is derived: (d) the amount of foreign income tax paid by the person in relation to the CFC from which the income is derived: (e) the amount of foreign tax paid, under legislation of another country or territory that is equivalent of the international tax rules, by a foreign company in relation to income derived by the CFC. 101. Section LK 1(1) sets out the rules for claiming FTCs for foreign tax paid or payable by a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM), against a person’s New Zealand tax liability on attributed FIF or CFC income. Subpart LK is designed to accommodate timing mismatches that routinely can occur between different jurisdictions. Consequently, tax paid or payable in the US that relates to the CFC or FIF attributed income derived by a person in New Zealand can be claimed as a credit, even if not paid in the relevant income year in New Zealand. Section 93C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 assists if the amount of the credit cannot be determined before a return is filed. The Commissioner must amend an assessment upon request to reflect a 19 credit if the request is made within four years from the end of the relevant income year. It is not however possible to claim a FTC under s LK (1) if it relates to attributed income in a different income year. Any FTC claimed is limited to an amount that offsets the tax payable in New Zealand on the attributed FIF or CFC income derived as if it were standalone income in the relevant year. Any surplus is not refundable but may be carried forward to a subsequent income year under s LK 4 provided the loss carry forward requirements of s LK 5 are met. 102. In ordinary circumstances, the tax is paid by the CFC or FIF (that is, s LK 1(1)(c) applies). Section LK 1(1)(d) is an important exception, as it deals with the scenario where a CFC or a FIF does not itself pay the CFC’s or FIF’s foreign income tax, but another person does (for example, a New Zealand investor in the CFC or FIF that is a foreign hybrid entity). Section LK 1(1)(d) was introduced to enable a New Zealand investor in a CFC or a FIF (which is a hybrid company or partnership) to claim a FTC for any foreign income tax paid (for example, US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income) against their New Zealand tax lability on attributed CFC or FIF income. 103. The effect of s LK 1(1)(d) is that a New Zealand investor in a hybrid entity (for example, a US LLC) that is a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM) may claim a FTC for foreign tax that they pay in relation to that CFC or FIF. This is in the same way as a New Zealand investor in a foreign company that is not a hybrid entity and that is also a CFC or a FIF (applying the AFIM) may claim a tax credit for foreign tax that the CFC or FIF pays. The tax credit is available for attributed CFC and FIF (applying the AFIM) income only. How s CD 18 applies to investments in a US LLC 104. Section CD 18 is a special provision that addresses the possible over-taxation of foreign-sourced dividend income derived by a New Zealand investor from a foreign hybrid entity. This arises where a shareholder pays the foreign tax of the hybrid entity that, in ordinary circumstances, the hybrid entity would pay, and this reduces the amount available for distribution as a dividend by the entity. Section CD 18 is directed at hybrid entities such as a US LLC, which is a company for New Zealand tax purposes but taxed as a partnership for US tax purposes. Section CD 18(1) and (2) provides: CD 18 Dividend reduced if foreign tax paid on company’s income When this section applies (1) This section applies when a person— (a) derives a dividend from a company that is a foreign company; and (b) has a liability under the laws of a country or territory outside New Zealand for income tax on income of the company corresponding to the liability that the person would have under the laws of New Zealand for income tax on income of the company if the company were a partnership in which the person were a partner; and (c) pays the income tax; and (d) provides to the Commissioner upon request, in the time allowed by the Commissioner, sufficient information to satisfy the Commissioner as to the amount of income tax paid. 20 Amount of dividend reduced (2) The amount of the dividend is reduced by the greater of zero and the amount calculated using the formula— total tax paid − earlier reductions. Definition of items in formula (3) In the formula,— (a) total tax paid is the total amount of income tax on income of the company that the person has paid in the country or territory by the time that the person derives the dividend: (b) earlier reductions is the total amount of reductions under this section that, by the time that the person derives the dividend, have affected other dividends derived by the person from the company. 105. Section CD 18 works to eliminate the over-taxation of dividends derived by a New Zealand investor in a hybrid entity such as a US LLC, so that the New Zealand investor is treated for New Zealand tax purposes as deriving the same amount of dividend income as a New Zealand investor in an ordinary (that is, non-hybrid) foreign company. This outcome is achieved by allowing a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity to deduct from a dividend derived from the foreign hybrid entity, any foreign tax that the New Zealand investor pays (for example, as a “partner”) on the foreign hybrid’s income. Note that the provision only permits a deduction for tax actually paid by the time the dividend is derived. Unlike subpart LK it does not extend to “tax paid or payable” to cover any timing mismatches between New Zealand and the foreign jurisdiction. Also, any refunds of foreign tax received must reduce the amount available as a deduction under s CD 18. A New Zealand investor in a US LLC may receive a refund as a result of filing their required personal tax return in the US. The treatment of a tax refund is illustrated in example 1 from \[137\]. 106. There is a requirement under the formula in s CD 18(2) to reconcile the foreign tax deducted from all dividends derived since inception of the investment in the company. This ensures that only amounts of foreign tax paid not already claimed as a deduction are available to reduce the dividends from the company that are taxed in New Zealand each year. 107. The application of s CD 18 is best illustrated by an example that assumes the following: (a) An individual New Zealand investor’s interest in a US LLC cost less than $50,000 in a year (that is, the New Zealand investor is required to pay tax on only dividends derived from the FIF). (b) The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $1,000. The US LLC makes a $700 distribution in that year. (c) The US imposes 30% ($300) federal income tax on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income. The US LLC withholds the tax and pays it on behalf of the New Zealand investor. (d) The US LLC made a distribution to the New Zealand investor in the prior year when the interest in the LLC was first acquired and US federal income tax was paid on that and then used to reduce the dividend derived in the prior year for New Zealand tax purposes. 21 (e) All amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars. 108. For New Zealand tax purposes, the $700 distribution and US withholding tax payment of $300 will both be a dividend. If the full $1,000 is taxed in New Zealand there would be over-taxation of that dividend from the New Zealand investor’s perspective compared with a dividend paid by an ordinary non-hybrid foreign company, because no recognition is given to the $300 US federal income tax the New Zealand investor paid. 109. In the case of an ordinary non-hybrid foreign company, the US company would pay the US tax of $300 and the dividend paid to the New Zealand investor would be $700 (after US company tax is paid). Section CD 18 achieves its objective by allowing the New Zealand investor to deduct the foreign tax that they pay on their distributive share of “partnership” income from any dividend that they derive from a foreign hybrid (the US LLC in this case). 110. In this example, the New Zealand investor is taxed on $700 ($1,000 – $300), which is the same amount they would have been taxed on if the US LLC had been an ordinary US company and paid the $300 company tax on its own income, then distributed the remaining (after tax) amount of $700. The $300 reduction was made after taking into account the total US federal tax paid on the US LLC since inception under the formula in s CD 18(2) and the amount of that tax used to reduce the dividend derived in the prior year. 111. In the context of the Rulings, albeit using a different mechanism than allowing FTCs, s CD 18 provides relief from the cross-jurisdictional taxation of dividends derived by New Zealand individual investors from a foreign hybrid entity. Section CD 18 deductions are available to investors in a US LLC that is a FIF or a CFC, except where the New Zealand investor is: (a) taxed on FIF income calculated applying one of the FDR, CV, CM or DRR FIF income calculation methods, because the dividend is “exempt” in this case; or (b) a company, because dividends derived by a New Zealand company from a foreign company are exempt income. How subpart OE (BETA) applies to individual investors in a US LLC 112. Section OE 1(2) provides that a natural person resident in New Zealand may choose to be a BETA person and maintain a BETA. These rules apply to an investment in a CFC and a FIF (where the New Zealand investor adopts the AFIM: s OE 5). 113. The purpose of a BETA is to enable an individual investor who has a net New Zealand tax liability (after FTCs have been applied) on their attributed CFC or FIF income to credit that amount to their BETA and to use this credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability payable on dividends derived from the FIF or CFC. 114. A BETA allows an individual investor to claim a tax credit (for tax that they pay on attributed CFC or FIF income) against their tax liability on dividend income, in a similar way to an investor in a New Zealand resident company claims an imputation credit for underlying tax paid by the company. In both cases, the purpose of the credit is to avoid economic double taxation on the dividend derived by an individual investor. 22 115. A New Zealand resident company cannot maintain a BETA. However, as dividends derived from a foreign company by a New Zealand resident company are exempt income, economic double taxation does not arise. 116. The BETA tax credit is calculated by applying the formula set out in s OE 19. For example, a New Zealand investor may have attributed CFC or FIF income of $10,000 and foreign tax paid relating to that income of $3,000 (30%). Assume that the New Zealand investor’s New Zealand tax liability is $3,300 (33%). The New Zealand investor can satisfy the New Zealand income tax liability by applying FTCs of $3,000 and paying the net tax liability of $300. The net tax paid of $300 can be credited to a person’s BETA and applied against any subsequent New Zealand tax liability on any dividend derived from the CFC or FIF. 117. The New Zealand investor’s right to use BETA tax credits to satisfy an income tax liability and the criteria that need to be satisfied for their use are set out in s OE 20. How the NZ–US DTA applies to an investment in a US LLC 118. A DTA can extend the circumstances where a country agrees to double taxation relief beyond their respective domestic tax laws. Two articles in the NZ–US DTA deal with relief from double taxation (arts 1(6) and 22) and may be relevant to the Rulings. Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA provides relief where the same income is taxed to the same person in two tax jurisdictions 119. Article 22 of the NZ–US DTA provides (in part): In the case of New Zealand, double taxation shall be avoided as follows: In accordance with, and subject to any provisions of, the law of New Zealand which may from time to time be in force and which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax for tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), United States tax paid under the law of the United States and consistently with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand arising in the United States (excluding in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income; except that such credit shall not exceed the amount of the tax that would be paid to the United States if the resident were not a United States citizen or a United States company. However, where a company which is a resident of New Zealand beneficially owns at least 10 percent of the paid-up share capital of a United States company any dividend derived by the first-mentioned company from the United States company (being dividends which, in accordance with the taxation law of New Zealand in existence at the date of signature of the Convention would be exempt from New Zealand tax) shall be exempt from New Zealand tax. ... For the purpose of allowing relief from double taxation pursuant to this Article, income shall be deemed to arise as follows: (a) income derived by a resident of the United States which may be taxed in New Zealand in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand; (b) income derived by a resident of New Zealand which may be taxed in the United States in accordance with the Convention (other than income taxed by the United States solely because the beneficial owner is a citizen of 23 the United States or a United States company) shall be deemed to arise in the United States; (c) For purposes of paragraph 3, income beneficially owned by a resident of New Zealand who is a citizen of the United States or a United States company shall be deemed to arise in New Zealand to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this paragraph. \[Emphasis added\] 120. Article 22 applies to US tax paid in respect of the same income derived by a New Zealand resident and arising in the US. That is, art 22 provides relief where the same income is taxed to the same person in two tax jurisdictions. 121. In the US LLC context, an amount allocated and credited to a member’s capital account and distributed to a New Zealand investor is a dividend derived for New Zealand tax purposes and will “arise” in the US. However, in terms of the arrangements in the Rulings, no US tax is paid at source on this dividend distribution, so no FTC is claimable. The New Zealand investor has paid US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s US taxable income on a partnership basis, but that is not US tax paid on the distribution to the New Zealand investor (which is a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes). Article 1(6) of the NZ–US DTA applies to a foreign investment by a New Zealand or US resident through a transparent entity 122. Article 1(6) of the NZ–US DTA deals with transparent entities, stating: An item of income, profit or gain derived through an entity that is fiscally transparent under the laws of either Contracting State shall be considered to be derived by a resident of a State to the extent that the item is treated for purposes of the taxation law of such Contracting State as the income, profit or gain of a resident. 123. Article 1(6) applies to a foreign investment by a New Zealand or US resident through a transparent entity. Income derived through a transparent entity is taxed to a New Zealand or US resident only where that entity is treated as transparent for the purposes of New Zealand and US tax law respectively; for example, a New Zealand investor in a partnership established in the US that is also a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes. The US partnership is a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes and is transparent for New Zealand tax purposes: s HG 2. In these circumstances, the New Zealand partner is taxed directly on their share of the partnership income. 124. Article 1(6) does not apply to a New Zealand investor in a US LLC. 13 A New Zealand investor derives partnership income under US federal income tax law (which satisfies the first part of art 1(6)), but that partnership income is not treated for the purposes of the taxation law of New Zealand as the income, profit or gain of the New Zealand investor in the US LLC (so the second part of art 1(6) is not satisfied). This is because the US LLC is a company and not a transparent entity for New Zealand tax purposes. 125. Article 1(6) does not apply to the facts of the Rulings. 13 This is confirmed in the (US) Department of the Treasury Technical Explanation of the Protocol Between the United States of America and New Zealand...signed at Wellington on July 23, 1982, in an example at the last paragraph of pg 4. 24 Overseas authority 126. The United Kingdom (UK) Supreme Court in Anson v Commissioners for HMRC \[2015\] UKSC 44 considered a dispute where the facts were materially similar to those in the Rulings. The court reached a different conclusion from the Commissioner’s conclusion in the Rulings. This raises the question, to what extent, if any, does Anson apply in New Zealand? 127. Anson involved a UK investor in a Delaware LLC. The dispute revolved around whether Anson was entitled to a FTC for US tax he paid on his distributive share of the US LLC’s income against UK tax paid on distributions from the US LLC. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs argued that no FTC was available because the distribution that was taxed in the UK was not the same income as Anson’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income on which the US tax had been paid. On the other hand, Anson argued that the income taxed in the US and UK was the same income, so he was entitled to a FTC for US tax paid. 128. The UK Supreme Court confirmed on appeal the reasoning of the First Tier Tribunal in Mr Swift v Commissioners for HMRC \[2010\] UKFTT 88 (TC). The UK Supreme Court concluded that the taxpayer was entitled to the profits of the US LLC as they arose because of the effect of § 18-503 of the LLC Act (2014 Delaware Code) and art IV of the US LLC’s operating agreement, so the US LLC should be categorised as a transparent entity (and the members taxed directly on the profits of the US LLC). In its judgment, the tribunal concluded that the characteristics of the US LLC were such that it was more akin to a partnership than a company. The Delaware LLC Act (§ 18-503) required that the profits and losses of an LLC were to be allocated to members in accordance with the US LLC’s operating agreement. Article IV of the US LLC’s operating agreement provided the US LLC’s gross income and expenses were to be credited and debited to a member’s capital account respectively. 129. Where the Commissioner is required to classify a foreign entity, such as a US LLC, for domestic tax law purposes, the approach adopted is to identify the key legal characteristics of the foreign entity and then to classify that entity by reference to New Zealand domestic tax law definitions (e.g. company or partnership). This approach is discussed in L Collins, Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws (13th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2000) at \[2.009\]: If the forum has to characterise a rule or institution of foreign law, it should inquire how the corresponding or most closely analogous rule or institution of its own law is characterised, and apply that characterisation to the foreign institution or rule. 130. Applying this approach, the potentially relevant corresponding or analogous entities for New Zealand tax purposes are a company, look-through company and partnership. 131. It is the Commissioner’s view that a US LLC is a company for New Zealand tax purposes for the reasons discussed at \[21\] to \[25\]. Additionally, the New Zealand legislative scheme provides that if a company owns and conducts a business, then the company (not the shareholders or members of the company) will be treated as deriving the income that it earns from the conduct of that business: s CB 1. In this context, a US LLC is a company and a separate legal entity. The US LLC owns the business assets, and the US LLC (not its members) conducts the business of the US LLC. Accordingly, under the scheme of the Act, the US LLC (not its members) is treated as deriving the income that it earns. 25 132. The Commissioner does not consider that a US LLC is a look-through company or a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes. A look-through company is a special type of company for New Zealand tax purposes, where, provided certain criteria are met, the shareholders are taxed on a look-through basis akin to a partnership – like a US LLC. One of the criteria for being a look-through company is that the company is resident in New Zealand. An underlying assumption in the Rulings is that the US LLC is a foreign company (that is, it is not resident in New Zealand). Therefore, US LLCs that these Rulings apply to are not look-through companies for New Zealand tax purposes. 133. A US LLC is not a partnership for New Zealand partnership law or tax purposes because the essential criterion for being a partnership is absent; that is, no relationship exists between persons (members in this context) carrying on business for profit (because it is the US LLC that carries on the business). A New Zealand investor in a US LLC would be taxed directly on the profits of a US LLC only if it were a partnership for New Zealand tax purposes. 134. The Commissioner does not consider that Anson applies in New Zealand. In Anson, an important element of the UK court’s reasoning was that the US LLC was akin to a Scottish partnership so should be treated as a transparent entity and its UK members taxed on a look-through basis. The Commissioner considers that the UK approach to categorising a foreign hybrid entity as transparent or opaque, based on whether that entity has features more akin to a partnership or company does not apply in New Zealand. In New Zealand, entities and transactions are characterised according to their legal form and not what transaction or entities they most closely resemble: Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) at 159. The Commissioner considers that a US LLC is a company because the legal characteristics of the US LLC meet the New Zealand tax definition of company and not merely because it more closely resembles a company than a partnership. 135. Section CD 18 is also an important feature of the scheme of the Act dealing with foreign hybrid entities. Section CD 18 deals explicitly with company–partnership foreign hybrids (US LLCs in this context) and the over-taxation of foreign source dividend income derived from a foreign hybrid entity. Section CD 18 permits a New Zealand investor in a foreign hybrid entity to deduct the foreign tax that they have paid from the dividend they derive from the foreign company. Section CD 18 is premised on the foreign hybrid entity (US LLC in this context) being a company that derives its own income and pays a dividend to its shareholder (even though it is taxed as a partnership in the foreign tax jurisdiction). Examples 136. The following six examples have common features: (a) A New Zealand investor (natural person or company) invests in a US LLC and is not the sole shareholder. (b) The US LLC is a company for New Zealand tax purposes. (c) The US LLC owns the assets of the business, and the business is conducted by the US LLC and not by its members. (d) The US LLC is treated as a partnership in the US, has not made an election to be taxed as a corporation and the New Zealand investor is subject to US federal income tax on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income. 26 (e) The New Zealand investor’s US federal income tax liability is withheld by the US LLC and paid on behalf of its New Zealand investors. (f) The New Zealand investor is required to and does file a US tax return including their distributive share of the US LLC income and tax withheld on their behalf by the US LLC. (g) The payment of US federal income tax by the US LLC withheld on behalf of its New Zealand investors is treated in the US LLC’s accounts as a distribution to the investors (that is, as a debit to the member’s capital account). (h) The payment by the US LLC of the member’s US federal income tax on their behalf is a distribution and a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes. (i) The Managing Members of the US LLC have the power to make distributions in their sole discretion. (Note that this feature does not apply to example 1.) (j) No US tax is paid on distributions from the US LLC, which are dividends for New Zealand tax purposes. (k) The US federal income tax rate is assumed to be 30%. (l) Where the New Zealand investor is a natural person, it is assumed they have a marginal tax rate of 33%, are not a transitional resident, and have not opted into the FIF rules where the FIF interests they hold are $50,000 or less. (m) All amounts are expressed in New Zealand dollars. Example 1: Individual New Zealand investor’s investment in a US LLC is under the $50,000 FIF threshold and distributions to members are mandatory Circumstances 137. An individual New Zealand investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of the individual investor’s attributing interest in FIFs does not exceed $50,000 throughout the year. 138. The New Zealand investor can withdraw amounts from their capital account, representing their share of the US LLC’s annual net accounting profits on request, subject to cash being available. 139. The New Zealand investor’s share of the US LLC’s net accounting profit is $1,100, as determined by the US LLC’s operating agreement. This share is credited to the New Zealand investor’s capital account in year 1. The New Zealand investor can withdraw this amount from their capital account as they wish. 140. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for US federal income tax purposes is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). The distributive share is the NZ investor’s proportional share of net accounting profits adjusted as required to meet US tax requirements. 141. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account) in year 1. 27 142. The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor in year 2. The New Zealand Investor also receives a US tax refund of $50 in year 2 after filing their US tax return for year 1. 143. Years 1 and 2 correspond to two different New Zealand income tax years – New Zealand income tax years 1 and 2. New Zealand tax consequences 144. The New Zealand investor will be taxed on the $1,100 dividend (the amount credited to their capital account and able to be withdrawn by the New Zealand investor) derived from the US LLC under s CD 1. The investor is not required to calculate income under the FIF rules under s CQ 5(1)(d). The New Zealand investor will be subject to tax on this dividend in New Zealand in income tax year 1, being the year in which the amount was credited to the New Zealand investor’s capital account and available for the New Zealand investor to withdraw. 145. The total distribution of $1,000 (the $700 distribution and the $300 US federal income tax paid by the US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) is not subject to New Zealand tax. This is because the dividend has already been subject to New Zealand tax in New Zealand income tax year 1. The dividend cannot be taxed twice due to s BD 3(6). 146. Section CD 18 applies to provide a deduction for the US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor ($300) in year 1. In other words, the New Zealand investor’s income is $1,100 (the dividend) less $300 (the US tax paid by the New Zealand investor). The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand income tax (at 33%) on the net dividend of $800 ($264). Both the US tax of $300 taken as a reduction of dividend income and the $50 tax refund received in year 2 decrease the amount of US tax that can be claimed in future under s CD 18 from year 2 onwards. 147. The New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the New Zealand–US DTA) for US federal income tax on the distributive share of the US LLC’s income against their New Zealand tax liability on dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not US tax paid on a dividend derived from the US LLC. Example 2: Individual New Zealand investor’s investment in a US LLC is under the $50,000 FIF threshold and distributions are not mandatory Circumstances 148. An individual New Zealand investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of the individual investor’s attributing interest in FIFs does not exceed $50,000 throughout the year. 149. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for US federal income tax purposes is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). 28 150. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). 151. The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences 152. The New Zealand investor will be taxed on only the actual dividends (the $700 distribution and $300 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) derived from the US LLC under s CD 1. The investor is not required to calculate income under the FIF rules under s CQ 5(1)(d). 153. Section CD 18 applies to provide a deduction for the US federal income tax paid by the New Zealand investor ($300). In other words, the New Zealand investor’s income is $1,000 (the dividend) less $300 (the US tax paid by the New Zealand investor). The New Zealand investor pays New Zealand income tax (at 33%) on the net dividend of $700 ($231). 154. The New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the New Zealand–US DTA) for US federal income tax paid on the distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on the $1,000 distribution treated as dividend income derived from the US LLC. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s US LLC distributive share is not paid on the dividend distribution from the US LLC. Example 3: Individual New Zealand investor in a US LLC adopts one of four FIF income calculation methods Circumstances 155. A New Zealand individual investor invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The cost of their interest is $60,000. 156. The New Zealand investor adopts one of the four income calculation methods: FDR, CV, CM or DRR. 157. The New Zealand investor’s FIF income from the US LLC adopting FDR is $2,000. 158. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $2,800, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $840 (30%). 159. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). 160. The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,900 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences 161. The New Zealand investor will be taxed in New Zealand on their FIF income as calculated by applying one of the four FIF income calculation methods. In this example, the FIF (FDR) income is $2,000 and New Zealand tax (at 33%) is $660. 29 162. The total distribution of $2,740 (the $1,900 distribution and the $840 US federal income tax paid by the US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) paid to the New Zealand investor by the US LLC is excluded income under ss EX 59(2) and CX 57B. It is also explicitly excluded from being a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes under s CD 36. Section CD 36 deems a distribution not to be a dividend where a person adopts any of the four methods (FDR, CV, CM or DRR) of calculating FIF income. 163. Section CD 18, which provides relief from the over-taxation of dividend distributions from foreign hybrid entities, does not apply because the distribution is deemed not to be a dividend under s CD 36. 164. A New Zealand investor cannot claim a New Zealand FTC (under ss LJ 1(1) and LJ 2(1) or the New Zealand–US DTA) for US federal income tax on their distributive share against their New Zealand tax liability on FIF income. This is because the US federal income tax paid on the New Zealand investor’s distributive share is not foreign tax paid on FIF income. 165. A New Zealand investor who adopts CV for their FIF income will treat the payment of the $840 of US tax on its behalf as a cost, a gain and as a reduction of the closing value under the formula in s EX 51(1) when calculating their FIF income. Example 4: New Zealand investor adopts the AFIM for calculating FIF income Circumstances 166. A New Zealand investor (a company or individual) invests in a US LLC that is a FIF for New Zealand tax purposes. The New Zealand investor adopts the AFIM for calculating FIF income. 167. The New Zealand investor’s FIF attributed income is $2,000 in their first year of holding the US LLC. 168. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes is $2,100, and the US federal income tax liability on that income in the first year is $630 (30%). 169. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($630) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). 170. The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,400 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences 171. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand income tax on FIF income and on any dividends (if they are an individual) derived from the US LLC. 172. The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the FIF’s income ($2,000), and New Zealand tax is $660 (33% if an individual) or $560 (28% if a company) under ss CQ 4, CQ 5, EX 44(1)(b) and EX 50. 173. The US federal income tax paid ($630) by the New Zealand investor on their share of the US LLC’s income is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s FIF 30 attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this is only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the FIF attributed income and the FTCs do not relate to any foreign tax paid on any active income of the FIF. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability is $660 less $630 (the FTC for US tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s profit), which equals $30 net New Zealand tax payable. For a company investor, no further NZ tax is payable as the FTC exceeds the NZ tax amount ($560-$630). 174. The total distribution of $2,030 (the $1400 distribution and the $630 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) from the US LLC is a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes and taxable income of the individual New Zealand investor. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: (a) Where the New Zealand investor is a company any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. No FTCs are claimable. (b) If the New Zealand investor is an individual, then the $2,030 dividend is income under s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their share of the US LLC’s income ($630) from the dividend derived from the US LLC ($2,030): s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend (that is, net of foreign tax paid by them in the US, which is $1400). (c) An individual New Zealand investor may choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming an FTC), then the individual investor may claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed FIF income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the net dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. (d) The net New Zealand tax liability after FTCs is $30 (the FIF income tax liability of $660 ($2,000 FIF income x 33% tax rate) less FTC $630 = $30). The $30 may be used as a BETA tax credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability on dividends derived from the FIF. Example 5: Investment in a US LLC that is a CFC Circumstances 175. A New Zealand investor (company or individual) invests in a US LLC that is a CFC. 176. The New Zealand investor’s CFC income is $2,000 in the first year of their investment. 177. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income in that same year is also $1,900. The US federal income tax liability on that income is $570 (30%). 178. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($570) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). 179. The US LLC subsequently distributes $1,300 to the New Zealand investor. 31 New Zealand tax consequences 180. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand income tax on CFC income and any dividends derived from the US LLC. 181. The New Zealand investor is taxed on their share of the CFC’s income that is, $2,000 and New Zealand tax (at 33%) for the individual is $660 and (at 28%) for the company is $560 under ss CQ 1 and CQ 2. 182. The US federal income tax paid ($570) by the New Zealand investor on their share of the US LLC’s income in the same year they acquired the investment is creditable against the New Zealand investor’s CFC attributed income tax liability: s LK 1(1)(d). Note that this is only to the extent it does not exceed the New Zealand tax payable on the CFC attributed income and the FTCs do not relate to any foreign tax paid on any active income of the CFC. The individual New Zealand investor’s net New Zealand tax liability is $660 less $570 (the FTC for US tax paid on their share of the US LLC’s profit), which equals $90 net New Zealand tax payable. Where the New Zealand investor is a company there is no further New Zealand tax liability as the FTC of $570 exceeds the NZ tax liability of $560. 183. The total distribution of $1,870 (the $1,300 distribution and the $570 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) from the US LLC is a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes and taxable income of the individual New Zealand investor. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: (a) Where the New Zealand investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. No FTCs are claimable. (b) If the New Zealand investor is an individual, then the $1,870 dividend is income in terms of s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their distributive share of the US LLC’s income ($570) from the dividend derived from the US LLC ($1,870): s CD 18. The New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend (that is, net of foreign tax paid by them in the US, which is $1,300). (c) An individual New Zealand investor can choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). If the individual investor has a net New Zealand tax liability on their attributed FIF income (after claiming FTC), then the individual investor may claim a BETA tax credit (for the New Zealand tax they have paid on their attributed CFC income) against the New Zealand tax liability on the net dividend (net of foreign tax paid through the application of s CD 18) under s OE 20. (d) There is a net New Zealand tax liability after FTCs of $90 (the FIF income tax liability of $660 ($2,000 FIF income x 33% tax rate) – FTC $570 = $90). The $90 may be used as a BETA tax credit to satisfy any New Zealand tax liability on dividends derived from the CFC. 32 Example 6: Investment in a US LLC that is a non-attributing active FIF or a non- attributing active CFC Circumstances 184. A New Zealand investor (company or individual) invests in a US LLC that is a non- attributing active FIF or CFC. 185. The New Zealand investor’s distributive share of the US LLC’s income for federal income tax purposes in their first year of investment is $1,000, and the US federal income tax liability on that income is $300 (30%). 186. The New Zealand investor’s US federal tax liability ($300) is withheld and paid by the US LLC on behalf of the investor and is treated as a distribution by the US LLC (debited against the New Zealand investor’s capital account). 187. The US LLC subsequently distributes $700 to the New Zealand investor. New Zealand tax consequences 188. There is no attributed income for either CFC or FIF purposes under s CQ 2(1)(h) or s CQ 5(1)(c)(xv) respectively. 189. The individual New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on only the $1,000 dividend distribution. 190. The New Zealand tax consequences of the dividend distribution are as follows: (a) Where the investor is a company, any dividends derived by a company from a foreign company are exempt income: s CW 9. No FTCs are claimable. (b) If the investor is an individual, then the $1,000 dividend (the $700 distribution and the $300 US federal income tax paid by US LLC on behalf of the New Zealand investor) is assessable to the individual investor under s CD 1. The New Zealand investor may deduct the US federal income tax paid on their share of the US LLC’s income ($300) from the dividend derived from the US LLC ($1,000): s CD 18. The individual New Zealand investor is subject to New Zealand tax on the net dividend (that is, net of foreign tax paid by them in the US, which is $700). (c) An individual New Zealand investor can choose to be a BETA person under s OE 1(2). However, as there is no FIF or CFC attributed income for the income year, no BETA credit is available for that year. 33 References Legislative references 2014 Delaware Code, § 18-503 Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983, arts 1, 22 Income Tax Act 2007, ss BD 3, CB 1, CD 1, CD 3 to CD 20, CD 36, CQ 1, CQ 2, CQ 4, CQ 5, CW 9, CX 57B, EX 28 to EX 37, EX 37B, EX 38 to EX 42, EX 42B, EX 43, EX 44, EX 46, EX 50, EX 51, EX 59, HG 2, LJ 1, LJ 2, LJ 4, LK 1, LK 4, K 5 subpart OE, YA 1 (“company”, “foreign company”, “partnership”, “share”) Internal Revenue Code (US), §§ 701, 703 Limited Liability Company Act (Delaware), §§ 18- 201, 18-502, 18-701 Partnership Act 1908, s 4 Tax Administration Act 1994, s 93C Case references Alliance Group Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,066 (HC) Anson v Commissioners for HMRC \[2015\] UKSC 44 CIR v Albany Food Warehouse (2009) 24 NZTC 23,532 (HC) Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) Mr Swift v Commissioners for HMRC \[2010\] UKFTT 88 (TC) Other references Collins, L, Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws (13th ed, Sweet & Maxwell, London, 2000) IRS, Taxation of Limited Liability Companies (Publication 3402, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, 2016) (US) Department of the Treasury Technical Explanation of the Protocol Between the United States of America and New Zealand...signed at Wellington on July 23, 1982 Watson, S, and L Taylor (eds), Corporate Law in New Zealand (online ed, Thomson Reuters, 2019) Abbreviations AFIM attributable foreign investment fund income method art, arts article, articles BETA branch equivalent tax account CFC controlled foreign corporation CM cost method CV comparative value DRR deemed rate of return.

BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 20/06: Income Tax and Goods and Services tax – Director’s liability and the COVID-19 “safe harbour” in schedule 12 to the Companies Act 1993 This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of s HD 15(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and s 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the directors of a company, in good faith, agreeing to the company carrying on business, including trading and incurring obligations, in reliance on the COVID-19 “safe harbour” in schedule 12 to the Companies Act 1993 (CA) during the “safe harbour period”. The safe harbour period started on 3 April 2020 and ends on the close of 30 September 2020 (or later, if the period is extended by regulation). During the safe harbour period, a decision by the directors of a company to keep on trading, as well as decisions to take on new obligations, will not result in a breach of the duties in ss 135 and 136 of the CA. Sections 135 and 136 of the CA provide that a director of a company must not: • agree to the business of the company being carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors; • cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors; or • agree to the company incurring an obligation, unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so. A company’s directors can rely on the safe harbour only where: • the directors consider in good faith that the company is facing or is likely to face significant liquidity problems in the next six months because of the impact of COVID-19 on the company or its creditors; • the company was able to pay its debts as they fell due on 31 December 2019 (or the company was incorporated on or after 1 January 2020 but before 3 April 2020); and • the directors consider in good faith that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within 18 months (for example, because trading conditions are likely to improve or the company is likely to able to reach an accommodation with its creditors). For the avoidance of doubt, this Arrangement does not include any particular “arrangement” entered into in relation to a company that, on its own terms, would ordinarily be subject to s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA, even if it is entered into during the safe harbour period. 2 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Reliance on the safe harbour by a director, and the company continuing to trade or carry on business or incur new obligations on commercial, ordinary business terms, will not, in and of itself, result in the application of s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA. • For the avoidance of doubt, s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA would still apply to any particular “arrangement” entered into in relation to a company that, on its own terms, would ordinarily be subject to those provisions, even if it is entered into during the safe harbour period. The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 3 April 2020 and ending on 30 September 2020. This Ruling is signed by me on 10 July 2020.

Under the recently enacted COVID-19 safe harbour in schedule 12 to the Companies Act 1993 (CA), during the safe harbour period certain decisions by the directors of a company, will not result in a breach of the duties in ss 135 and 136 of the CA where: • the directors consider in good faith that the company is facing or is likely to face significant liquidity problems in the next six months because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company or its creditors; • the company was able to pay its debts as they fell due on 31 December 2019 (or the company was incorporated on or after 1 January 2020 but before 3 April 2020); and • the directors consider in good faith that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within 18 months (for 2 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] example, because trading conditions are likely to improve or the company is likely to able to reach an accommodation with its creditors). 2. It is possible (if not likely) that despite the existence of the safe harbour, some companies will still face insolvency and be unable to pay their tax liabilities. This raises the issue of whether a director of a company who has made decisions in reliance of the safe harbour, or a relevant shareholder of the company, could be liable for the tax liability. 3. Section HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) (asset stripping of companies) permits income tax owing by a company to be recovered from the company’s directors and shareholders where an arrangement has been entered into that has an effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability. Section 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA) provides that s HD 15 applies as if “income tax” and “tax” read “goods and services tax”. 4. Section HD 15(1) of the ITA sets out when the section applies, with the liability for a director or shareholder (as agent) being provided for in s HD 15(3) to (5) and (7). This Ruling and commentary are limited to whether the requirements of s HD 15(1) of the ITA, and therefore s 61 of the GSTA, are met in the context of the safe harbour and do not provide guidance on the application of those sections more generally. 5. For s HD 15 of the ITA to apply, four requirements must be satisfied: • An arrangement is entered into in relation to a company. • The arrangement has an effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability (either an existing liability or one that arises later). • It is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet or will not be able meet a tax liability. • It is reasonable to conclude that if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement had made reasonable inquiries, they could have anticipated that the tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met. 6. Determining the effect and intended purpose of an arrangement is highly fact specific. 7. Considering the four requirements, for s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA to apply, it is necessary for the arrangement to: • involve the depletion of the assets of a company; and • be designed to have the effect that the company cannot pay a tax obligation. 8. The Commissioner’s view is that s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA will not apply to a company that is unable to pay a tax obligation where: • the directors of a company facing significant liquidity problems because of the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting economic climate, decide in good faith to rely on the safe harbour and continue carrying on business; or • as a result of the directors’ decision to rely on the safe harbour, the company continues carrying on business and trading or incurs new obligations on ordinary commercial business terms (for example, bank loans or sales at credit). 9. However, s HD 15 of the ITA and s 61 of the GSTA will still, in the Commissioner’s view, apply to any arrangement that would ordinarily be subject to the provision, notwithstanding that the arrangement was entered into during the safe harbour period following a company directors’ decision to rely on the safe harbour. 3 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 10. Examples illustrating the general approach to the application of s HD 15 of the ITA and s 61 of the GSTA in the context of the COVID-19 safe harbour can be found later in this commentary. Background – safe harbour 11. The COVID-19 Response (Further Management Measures) Legislation Bill Government Act 2020 introduced, among other things, a “safe harbour” in relation to two directors’ duties in the CA. The Companies Office describes this safe harbour on its website: 1 The introduction of a ‘safe harbour’ from sections 135 and 136 of the Companies Act 1993 will provide relief to company directors facing insolvency as a result of COVID-19. The ‘safe harbour’ provisions – which have been backdated to April 3, when the proposals were first announced – aim to ease the pressure on directors who may otherwise feel the need to wind up their business, perhaps prematurely, owing to the current climate. 12. The relevant directors’ duties in ss 135 and 136 of the CA provide as follows: 135 Reckless trading A director of a company must not— (a) agree to the business of the company being carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors; or (b) cause or allow the business of the company to be carried on in a manner likely to create a substantial risk of serious loss to the company’s creditors. 136 Duty in relation to obligations A director of a company must not agree to the company incurring an obligation unless the director believes at that time on reasonable grounds that the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so. 13. Directors will be able to rely on the safe harbour only if they are facing significant liquidity problems because of the impact of COVID-19. All other obligations and duties under the CA must still be complied with, including the duty to always act in the best interests of the company. 14. The safe harbour provisions are in schedule 12 to the CA and set out in full in the Appendix. The purpose of the safe harbour is described in cl 1 of schedule 12: 1 Purpose of schedule (1) The purpose of this schedule is to give to directors of companies that are facing significant liquidity problems because of the effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 more certainty about their duties when— (a) agreeing to the business of the company being carried on or causing or allowing the business of the company to be carried on; and (b) agreeing to the company incurring obligations. (2) However, it is not a purpose of this schedule to facilitate the ability of a company that has no realistic prospect of continuing to trade or operate in the medium or long term to defer a decision to enter into liquidation to the detriment of its creditors. 1 Companies Office, “‘Safe harbour’ for company directors” (web page, 2020, https://companies- register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/help-centre/company-directors/safe-harbour-for-company- directors/). 4 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 15. Under cl 5 of schedule 12 the safe harbour period starts on 3 April 2020 and ends on the close of 30 September 2020 (or later, if the period is extended by regulation). In general (subject to some exclusions), cl 4 provides that the safe harbour provisions will apply to only a company that: • as at 31 December 2019, was able to pay its debts as they became due in the normal course of business; or • was incorporated on or after 1 January 2020 but before 3 April 2020. 16. Clause 6 of schedule 12 sets out the safe harbour relating to reckless trading (s 135 of the CA). The clause applies when a director of a company during the safe harbour period: • agrees to the business of the company being carried on in any manner; or • causes or allows the business of the company to be carried on in any manner. 17. Clause 6(2) provides that the actions of a director will not breach s 135 of the CA if, at the time of taking the action, the director, in good faith, is of the opinion that: (a) the company has, or in the next six months is likely to have, significant liquidity problems; (b) the liquidity problems are, or will be, a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the company, its debtors, or its creditors; and (c) it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its due debts on and after 30 September 2021 (or a later date prescribed by regulation). 18. Clause 7 of schedule 12 relates to the duty in relation to obligations in s 136 of the CA and will apply to a director of a company who: • during the safe harbour period, agrees to the company incurring an obligation; and • at that time, is, in good faith, of the opinion that the company has, or in the next six months is likely to have, significant liquidity problems. 19. Clause 7(2) provides that for the purposes of s 136 of the CA, the director has reasonable grounds to believe the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so if the director, in good faith, is of the opinion that: (a) the liquidity problems are, or will be, a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the company, its debtors, or its creditors; and (b) it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its due debts on and after 30 September 2021 (or a later date prescribed by regulation). 20. In summary, the safe harbour provisions provide that directors’ decisions to carry on business, and decisions to incur new obligations, from 3 April 2020 to the close of 30 September 2020 (unless extended by regulation), will not result in a breach of duties if: • the directors consider in good faith that the company is facing or is likely to face significant liquidity problems in the next six months because of the impact of COVID-19 on the company or its creditors; • the company was able to pay its debts as they fell due on 31 December 2019 (or the company was incorporated on or after 1 January 2020 but before 3 April 2020); and • the directors consider in good faith that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its debts as they fall due within 18 months (for 5 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] example, because trading conditions are likely to improve or the company is likely to able to reach an accommodation with its creditors). 21. The safe harbour provisions are not designed to support an entity that has no realistic prospect of continuing to trade by deferring a decision about liquidation to the detriment of its creditors. 22. It is possible (if not likely) that despite the existence of the safe harbour, some companies will still face insolvency and be unable to pay their tax liabilities. This raises the issue of whether a director of a company who has made decisions in reliance of the safe harbour, or a relevant shareholder of the company, could be liable for the tax liability under s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA. 23. It would be surprising for Parliament to have enacted the safe harbour to allow directors of companies adversely affected by COVID-19 to make certain decisions without breaching their duties under the CA, if relying on the safe harbour, without more, would be enough to result in liability under other legislation, such as s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA. Application of the legislation Section HD 15 24. Section HD 15 of the ITA (asset stripping of companies) permits income tax owing by a company to be recovered from the company’s directors and shareholders where an arrangement has been entered into that has an effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability. Section 61 of the GSTA is the corresponding provision in relation to GST. It provides that s HD 15 of the ITA applies as if “income tax” and “tax” read “goods and services tax”. In the following analysis, references to s HD 15 should be read as also applying to s 61. Both provisions are set out in the Appendix. 25. Section HD 15(1) of the ITA sets out when the section applies: (1) This section applies when— (a) an arrangement has been entered into in relation to a company; and (b) an effect of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet a tax liability (the tax obligation) whether existing at the time of the arrangement or arising after that time, for— (i) income tax: (ii) a civil penalty, as defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: (iii) an amount payable under Part 7 of that Act; and (c) it is reasonable to conclude that— (i) a purpose of the arrangement is to have the effect described in paragraph (b); and (ii) if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement made reasonable inquiries, they could have anticipated at the time that the income tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met. 26. For s HD 15 of the ITA to apply, four requirements must be satisfied: • An arrangement is entered into in relation to a company (including a trustee company). 6 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • The arrangement has an effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability (either an existing liability or one that arises later). • It is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet or will not be able meet a tax liability. • It is reasonable to conclude that if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement had made reasonable inquiries, they could have anticipated that the tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met. 27. If these four requirements are met, the remaining subsections of the provision, set out when the directors and certain shareholders of the company can be treated as agents of the company in relation to the unpaid tax. Each of these requirements is discussed in turn below. Arrangement has been entered into in relation to a company. 28. Section HD 15(1)(a) of the ITA requires an arrangement to have been entered into in relation to a company. Meaning of an “arrangement” 29. An “arrangement” is defined in s YA 1 of the ITA: arrangement means an agreement, contract, plan, or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect 30. The definition of arrangement provides for varying degrees of formality and enforceability. For example, an arrangement may be: • a legally binding contract; • an agreement or plan that may or may not be legally binding; • an understanding that may or may not be legally binding; or • a contract that is not enforceable at law due to public policy, contractual incapacity or illegality. 31. The courts have considered the predecessor definitions of arrangement to that in s YA 1 of the ITA, particularly in the context of the general anti-avoidance provision. They described an arrangement as embracing all kinds of concerted action by which persons may arrange their affairs for a particular purpose or to produce a particular effect (see, for example, the decision of Richardson P in the Court of Appeal in CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450) 32. An arrangement may involve more than one transaction or document. Whether two or more transactions or documents together constitute an arrangement is a matter of fact (Peterson v CIR \[2005\] UKPC 5 at \[33\]). 33. In determining whether transactions or documents (or both) are part of an arrangement, the courts generally ask whether: • the transactions or documents are: o sufficiently interrelated or interdependent (or both); o part of an overall plan to obtain a particular objective or outcome; or • there is prior planned linking or sequencing (or both) of the documents or transactions. 7 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 34. However, a mere sequence of events without overall planning is not sufficient to constitute an arrangement. In AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC), McGechan J stated: \[125\] The four steps do not amount to a “contract, agreement, plan, or understanding”. They are a mere sequence of events, each with knock-on causative consequences, but that situation does not suffice. The concepts of contract, agreement, plan or understanding predicate some prior planned linking or sequencing or both, and that element is absent. \[126\] ... This is a sequence of events. It is the way things eventuated. It cannot be strained to fit within concepts involving overall planning such as contracts, agreements, plans or understanding. The legislation is not aimed at simple sequences of events of this character without prior overall planning. These happen, and are allowed for on the basis of experience, within the tax base. The legislation is concerned with planned measures, not allowed for, which degrade the tax base. \[Emphasis added\] 35. Therefore, an arrangement requires an overall plan or some prior planned linking or sequencing (or both) of transactions or documents. 36. Other aspects of an arrangement include the following: • An arrangement is defined to include a “plan”, which could involve a single person (Russell v CIR (No 2) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463 (HC) (footnote 33 at \[101\]) and Russell v CIR \[2012\] NZCA 128 (at \[54\]). • An arrangement does not require a consensus or a meeting of minds of two or more people, so a taxpayer could be party to an “arrangement” even if they are not consciously involved in or aware of the details (Peterson at \[34\]). • An arrangement may consist of more than one agreement, contract, plan or understanding, so an agreement, contract, plan or understanding may be part of a wider arrangement as well as being part of a separate narrower arrangement. • An arrangement includes steps and transactions that are entered into or carried out outside New Zealand (BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,732 (HC) at \[123\]). 37. When analysing the potential application of s HD 15 of the ITA in relation to the safe harbour, it is useful to keep in mind three potential arrangements: • The directors of a company facing significant liquidity problems because of the impact of COVID-19, decide, in good faith, to rely on the safe harbour and continue operating. Of itself, this may not be an “arrangement” – it may simply be a decision made by the directors. However, it could be a “plan”, which is included in the definition of “arrangement” in s YA 1 of the ITA. • As a result of the directors’ decision, the company continues to trade or takes on new obligations (for example, bank loans or sales at credit). A company simply engaging in trade is likely to be a mere sequence of events, so may be insufficient to be an “arrangement”. However, any individual transaction or obligation entered into could be an “arrangement” in its own right. • During the safe harbour period, the directors resolve or arrange for the company to enter into an “arrangement” of a type that (of itself) would potentially be subject to s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA absent the directors’ decision to rely on the safe harbour. Meaning of “in relation to” 38. Section HD 15(1)(a) of the ITA requires that an arrangement is entered into “in relation to a company”. 8 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 39. On the face of it, the words “in relation to” appear to have a broad application. In Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, the Court of Appeal considered that the words “in respect of or in relation to” were of the widest import. Similarly, Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239 (FCA) concerned a similar phrase, “in connection with”. The court in Claremont considered that the phrase referred to a relationship between two things, but not necessarily a causal relationship. A similar view was also expressed in Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272 (CA), where the court stated that the meaning of phrases such as “in connection with”, “in relation to” and “in respect of” depend on the context in which the phrases are used. Hardie Boys J said (at 279): “In connection with” may signify no more than a relationship between one thing and another. The expression does not necessarily require that it be a causal relationship: Our Town FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1987) 16 FCR 465, 479 per Wilcox J. But, as Davies J warned in Hatfield v Health Insurance Commission (1987) 15 FCR 487, at p 491: “Expressions such as ‘relating to’, ‘in relation to‘, ‘in connection with’ and ‘in respect of’ are commonly found in legislation but invariably raise problems of statutory interpretation. They are terms which fluctuate in operation from statute to statute. ... The terms may have a very wide operation but they do not usually carry the widest possible ambit, for they are subject to the context in which they are used, to the words with which they are associated, and to the object or purpose of the statutory provision in which they appear.” 40. The phrase “in relation to” indicates that the arrangement must relate to the company itself. It would not be sufficient if the arrangement simply involves a company that is a party to an arrangement. This interpretation is supported by the language used in other parts of s HD 15 of the ITA; that is, regarding the effect of the arrangement on the company’s ability to satisfy its tax liabilities. Nature of the arrangement for s HD 15(1)(a) of the ITA 41. It is well established in case law that the arrangement for the purposes of s HD 15 of the ITA (or its earlier equivalents, s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004) must involve the stripping or depletion of assets from the company. While the wording of the earlier provisions differs, the purpose and intended scope is the same as for s HD 15. For completeness, it is noted that the case law is unclear whether this is a requirement that is drawn from the language of subs (1)(a) or (b), but for current purposes it is not necessary to consider that distinction in any detail. 42. The High Court in Spencer v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,818 considered the application of s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994. In relation to the purpose of the section, Paterson J stated: \[34\] The general purpose of s HK 11 \[now s HD 15\] of the Income Tax Act is to enable the Commissioner to recover tax or, in this case, GST from the directors and shareholders of a company that has entered into an arrangement or transaction to deplete the company’s assets so that it is unable to fully meet its tax liabilities. \[Emphasis added\] 43. Similarly, in Case X11 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,175, Judge Willy stated: \[9\] It is clear from subs. (1) that the intention of the legislature is to allow the Commission to recover tax from the directors and shareholders of a company which has entered into an arrangement an effect or purpose of which is to deplete or strip the company’s assets so that it is unable to meet it’s tax liabilities. \[Emphasis added\] 9 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 44. Further, in Henderson v CIR \[2016\] NZHC 1987, (2016) 27 NZTC 22,068 (HC), Gendall J referred to the stripping of assets (specifically in relation to s HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA), stating: Second requirement – was it an effect of the arrangement that each company cannot meet a tax liability? \[61\] Under s 61 of the GST Act an effect of the arrangement must be that the company in question cannot meet a tax liability (either an existing liability or one that arises later). \[62\] In this case the sale to the Council of the properties concerned converted the assets of the companies from land and buildings to cash. There can be no doubt that the net sale proceeds were then stripped from the companies under the arrangement and following the various transactions and steps that were taken, the companies were unable to satisfy their GST debts. I am left in no doubt that this was the end result of the arrangement. It is what the arrangement achieved irrespective of any motive otherwise which the appellant maintains he had. It was the effect of the arrangement and it must follow therefore that the TRA \[Taxation Review Authority\] was correct to find that the second requirement under s 61 is satisfied. ... \[65\] I am satisfied that if any purpose of the arrangement was to have the effect of stripping assets from the company, so that they were unable to satisfy their liabilities to creditors (of which their tax liability is one), then that is a sufficient purpose for this requirement to be met. It is not necessary that the purpose is the dominant or principal purpose. \[Emphasis added\] 45. The requirement that the “arrangement” involve the depletion or stripping of assets is also consistent with contextual and extrinsic material. The section heading of s HD 15 of the ITA is “asset stripping of companies”, which is an indication from Parliament regarding the focus of the provision. 46. The business tax policy document released with the 1991 Budget (Taxation Policy – Business Tax Policy 1991 (Ministers of Finance and Revenue, 30 July 1991)) referred to the need for the arrangement to involve the depletion or stripping of assets: Chapter 10: Tax Recovery Introduction This chapter provides more information on the Government’s decision to replace section 276 of the Income Tax Act with a better targeted tax recovery provision. That new provision \[what is now s HD 15\] will enable the Commissioner to recover tax from the directors and shareholders of a company that has entered into an arrangement or transaction to deplete the company’s assets so that it is unable to fully meet its tax liabilities. ... The new recovery provision will be triggered by arrangements or transactions that have been entered into to deplete the company of its assets so that it has insufficient funds to fully meet its tax liabilities. However, it will not be triggered by formal arrangements (under insolvency proceedings) or informal arrangements (under section 414A of the Income Tax Act) between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the company and its other creditors, which result in the Commissioner accepting less than the full amount of tax outstanding. \[Emphasis added\] 47. Similarly, Tax Compliance (Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998) states: 11.45 Section HK 11 is directed at arrangements which deplete a company’s assets so that it is unable to meet its tax liabilities. The company is often liquidated as part of the arrangement, or simply because after a transaction is completed, the company serves no useful purpose. ... \[Emphasis added\] 10 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 48. Finally, the Commissioner has taken a similar approach, in “Tax recovery provision: Application to civil penalties and interest” (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005): 44) stating: Section HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004 is directed at arrangements which deplete a company’s assets so that it is unable to meet its tax liabilities. \[Emphasis added\] 49. This material strongly suggests that a company’s directors simply making a decision, in good faith, for the company to continue to carry on business, or to enter into an obligation due to the existence of the safe harbour will not be sufficient for s HD 15 of the ITA to apply. Similarly, a company carrying on trading or entering into obligations at a time when the directors believe, in good faith, that the requirements of the safe harbour are met will not fall within the scope of s HD 15. For s HD 15 to apply, it is necessary for the arrangement in question to involve the assets of the company being stripped or depleted. Effect of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet a tax liability 50. The second requirement is that an effect of the arrangement must be that the company cannot meet a tax liability (s HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA). Meaning of “effect” 51. The term “effect” has been discussed in the context of anti-avoidance provisions. In Auckland Harbour Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,433 (CA), delivering the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal, Richardson P said (at 15,451) that “effect” meant the end accomplished or achieved: In context, we consider it \[the word “effect”\] has its standard meaning of “the end accomplished or achieved” (Newton v C of T (1958) AC 450 at p465). 52. Similarly, in his dissenting judgment in CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 (CA), Thomas J said (at 17,132) that the word “effect” directed focus to the result or consequence of an arrangement: The word “effect” directs the focus to the result or consequence of the arrangement as opposed to a bare description of tax avoidance. It focuses on the physical characteristics of the arrangement. (See The Valabh Committee, Key Reforms to the Scheme of Tax Legislation, Discussion Paper, October 1991, paras 3.5, and 3.6). The Courts have also held that the purpose of an arrangement is to be determined by its effect. It is sufficient to refer to the succinct statement of Woodhouse P in the Challenge Corporation case (at p 533): “I am satisfied as well that the issue... is something to be decided, not subjectively in terms of motive, but objectively by reference to the arrangement itself.” \[Emphasis added\] 53. The approach taken by Thomas J was later endorsed by the Privy Council in Peterson at 34. Thomas J also said that the word “effect” focused on the physical characteristics of the arrangement. 54. In Newton v FCT \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 (PC), Lord Denning said (at 764) that you must look at the arrangement itself to see its effect—what it does—irrespective of the motives of the persons who made the arrangement: ... In applying the section you must, by the very words of it, look at the arrangement itself and see which is its effect – which it does – irrespective of the motives of the person who made it. Mr Justice Williams put it well when he said: “The purpose of a contract, agreement, or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascertained from its terms. Those terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the 11 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] circumstances but, when they have been ascertained, their purpose must be what they effect.” \[Emphasis added\] 55. In summary, an effect of an arrangement is a result or consequence of the arrangement (in other words – what the arrangement does). Determining an effect of an arrangement is an objective test having regard to the outcome or outcomes of the arrangement itself. The motives of the parties are irrelevant. This determination is highly fact specific. 56. The word “effect” should be interpreted similarly in s HD 15 of the ITA. Determining an effect of an arrangement is an objective test having regard to the outcome or outcomes of the arrangement rather than the motives of the parties. 57. Section HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA refers to an effect of the arrangement. The use of the indefinite article “an” with the noun “effect” implies that the required effect may be one of multiple effects of the arrangement, irrespective of its prominence or its incidental nature. It need not be the sole, dominant, or principal effect. This means any arrangement that results in a company being unable to meet its tax obligations will have the requisite effect. Meaning of “tax liability” 58. Section HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA requires that an effect of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet a tax liability. 59. The term “tax liability” is not defined in the ITA, GSTA or Tax Administration Act 1994. However, a tax liability is a key concept explained in the core provisions of the ITA. Under s BC 6 of the ITA the income tax liability for a filing taxpayer is the amount calculated by “multiplying their taxable income for the tax year by the basic rate of tax” (this is modified for scheduler income under s BC 7 of the ITA). 60. Section HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA defines the concept of a “tax obligation” as being a tax liability of the company that cannot be met as a result of the arrangement. That tax obligation can exist at the time of the arrangement or arise after the arrangement has been entered into. The tax liability must be for income tax (or GST by virtue of s 61 of the GSTA), a civil penalty, or interest. Meaning of “cannot meet” 61. Based on the definitions of “can”, “cannot” and “not” in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011), the ordinary meaning of “cannot” is not able to do something. The relevant meaning of the word “meet”, according to that same dictionary, is to “fulfil or satisfy” a requirement or condition. Accordingly, under s HD 15 of the ITA an effect of the arrangement must be that the company is unable to fulfil or satisfy a tax liability. 62. This is consistent with the wording used in earlier equivalents of s HD 15, with s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and s HK 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004 using the words “unable to satisfy”. 63. Arguably, any arrangement that results in a company not being able to pay its tax will satisfy the requirement of s HD 15(1)(b) of the ITA. However, of itself this is not enough to conclude that the section will apply. 12 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether it is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet a tax liability 64. The third requirement is that it is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is to have the effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability (s HD 15(1)(c)(i) of the ITA). The focus is on the purpose of the arrangement not the motive of any person. 65. Whether something is reasonable involves an objective test (see Vinyl Processors (New Zealand) Ltd v Cant \[1991\] 2 NZLR 416 (HC) at 420 and 421). What is reasonable may vary depending on the factual situation. 66. The way in which a purpose test is to be applied and the factors relevant in ascertaining purpose depend on the statutory context (CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA)). 67. The meaning of the purpose of an arrangement has been considered in the context of the general anti-avoidance provision s BG 1 of the ITA and earlier equivalent provisions. 68. In an avoidance context, the courts have held that the “purpose or effect” of an arrangement is determined objectively and the motives or intentions of the parties are not relevant. In that context, the courts have held that the purpose of an arrangement is the effect that is sought to be achieved or its intended effect. 69. This is evident from the decision of the Supreme Court in Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359: \[35\] ... Secondly, the Commissioner must have been properly satisfied that the arrangement was entered into between the parties to it to defeat the intent and application of the Act or any provision of the Act. This does not mean that the Commissioner must have been satisfied that the parties subjectively had that defeating purposes, i.e that they were consciously trying to achieve the end of defeating the intent and application of the Act. ... \[36\] A natural and sensible reading of s 76 \[of the GSTA\], as it stood prior to 2000, is to read it as requiring the Commissioner to be satisfied that an arrangement has been entered into between persons “so as to” defeat the intent and application of the Act or any provision of the Act. That requires the Commissioner and the Court to ask what objectively was the purpose of the arrangement, which in turn requires examination of the effect of the arrangement. Section 76, even in its pre-2000 version, therefore requires an examination of the purpose or effect of the arrangement, and in this respect the current version of the section has merely stated expressly what was implicit in the former version. ... \[38\] ... the general anti avoidance provision was concerned not with the purpose of the parties, but with the purpose of the arrangement. That is a crucial distinction. Once you put the purpose of the parties to one side and seek by objective examination to find the purpose of the arrangement, you must necessarily do that by considering the effect which the arrangement has had — what it has achieved — and then, by working backwards as it were from the effect, you are able to determine what objectively the arrangement must be taken to have had as its purpose. That approach is inevitable once any subjective purpose or motive is ruled out of contention, as the authorities say it must be. \[Emphasis added\] 70. The High Court in Henderson confirmed that in s HD 15 of the ITA the purpose needs to be determined objectively: \[64\] Here the determination of a purpose of an arrangement requires an objective examination. In deciding what the purpose or purposes of an arrangement are it is necessary to consider what it achieved, that is the end 13 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] result. It must then be considered whether that was one of the things the arrangement was designed to achieve. \[65\] I am satisfied that if any purpose of the arrangement was to have the effect of stripping assets from the company, so that they were unable to satisfy their liabilities to creditors (of which their tax liability is one), then that is a sufficient purpose for this requirement to be met. It is not necessary that the purpose is the dominant or principal purpose. \[66\] Here, the companies were insolvent at the relevant time. They could not pay both the GST and their other unsecured creditor, ILR. That part of the arrangement that involved disbursing the net sale proceeds to ILR (and subsequently to PVL and then its creditors and the creditors of its subsidiaries) left the companies with no assets. This resulted in them being unable to pay their GST liabilities. Irrespective of the stated motive of the appellant, objectively that was the outcome of the arrangement, and that was the end result the arrangement was designed to achieve. It must be accepted therefore that it was a purpose of that part of the arrangement. It is reasonable to conclude therefore that an objective purpose of the arrangement was to have the effect that the companies could not meet their GST liabilities. \[67\] Effectively here, the companies were insolvent at the time and it cannot be right that they can enter into arrangements as a result of which they receive windfall amounts they would otherwise not be entitled to and then use such amounts for their own purposes without paying their tax liabilities. \[Emphasis added\] 71. However, there is a key difference in the wording of s HD 15 of the ITA and the general anti-avoidance provision. Section HD 15(1)(c)(i) refers only to the relevant arrangement’s purpose and requires that a purpose of the arrangement is to have the effect described in s HD 15(1)(b); that is, that the company cannot meet a tax liability. Section HD 15(1)(c)(i) does not require the purpose to be that effect (such an interpretation would render para (c) redundant and to the same effect as para (a)). The wording of s HD 15(1)(c)(i) suggests that the required purpose must be the arrangement’s intended purpose; not simply the ultimate outcome. This is supported by the decision of the High Court in Henderson, where Gendall J referred to the “end result the arrangement was designed to achieve”. 72. Whether the arrangement has the required purpose therefore involves considering whether the outcome or end result (effect) of the arrangement was what the arrangement was designed to achieve, objectively determined. This consideration will be highly fact specific. 73. Section HD 15(1)(c)(i) of the ITA uses an indefinite article in the phrase “a purpose of the arrangement” (emphasis added). This means it will be sufficient if any purpose of the arrangement was that the arrangement would have an effect involving the depletion of the assets of a company with the result that the company cannot meet an existing or future tax liability. It is not necessary for this purpose to have been the sole, dominant, or principal purpose. 74. This strongly suggests that ordinary business dealings – in terms of a company trading or entering into obligations in reliance of the safe harbour – will not generally be subject to s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA. To the extent that such dealings – together with the decision to utilise the safe harbour – are an “arrangement entered into in relation to a company”, it would not be reasonable to conclude that that arrangement alone had been designed with a purpose of the company being unable to pay a tax liability. This is supported by the fact it is a requirement of the safe harbour that a director be of the opinion, in good faith, that the company will be in a position to meet its debts on and after 30 September 2021. 75. We note, however, that the fact a company’s directors decide to rely on the safe harbour will not prevent s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA from applying to 14 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] any arrangement that would ordinarily be caught by the relevant provision. Any arrangement designed with a purpose of achieving the end result of avoiding a tax liability would still be subject to the application of s HD 15 or s 61. Whether it is reasonable to conclude that a director could have anticipated the tax liability 76. The fourth requirement is that it is reasonable to conclude that if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement made reasonable inquiries they could have anticipated at the time that the tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met (s HD 15(1)(c)(ii) of the ITA). 77. As noted above, whether something is reasonable involves an objective test and what is reasonable may vary depending on the factual situation. The inquiry for the purposes of s HD 15(1)(c)(ii) of the ITA is based on the circumstances that existed at the time of the arrangement. 78. It must be possible for the director to have anticipated that the tax liability would or would likely be required to be met. In Commissioner of Police v Ombudsman \[1985\] 1 NZLR 578 (HC) Jeffries J said (at 589) that the words “would be likely” as used in s 6 of the Official Information Act 1982 meant there was a distinct or significant possibility the result might occur: The words “would be likely” I consider mean that there is a distinct, or significant possibility the result might occur, but no higher than that. On the scale of probability it is above a slight chance and below an expectation. It suggests, in my view, without question mentally conceivable. 79. Adopting a similar approach to Jeffries J, for the purposes of s HD 15(1)(c)(ii), the director must have been able to anticipate that: • the relevant tax liability would be required to be met; or • there was a distinct or significant possibility that the relevant tax liability would be required to be met. 80. Of itself, this final requirement is not overly helpful in this context. Conclusion 81. As set out above, for s HD 15 of the ITA (and therefore s 61 of the GSTA) to apply, four requirements must be satisfied: • An arrangement is entered into in relation to a company. • The arrangement has an effect that the company cannot meet a tax liability (either an existing liability or one that arises later). • It is reasonable to conclude that a purpose of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet or will not be able meet a tax liability. • It is reasonable to conclude that if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement made reasonable inquiries, they could have anticipated that the tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met. 82. Determining the effect and intended purpose of an arrangement is highly fact specific. 83. Considering the four requirements, for s HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA to apply, it is necessary for the arrangement to: • involve the depletion of the assets of a company; and 15 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • be designed to have the effect that the company cannot pay a tax obligation. 84. Section HD 15 of the ITA or s 61 of the GSTA will not apply to a company that is unable to pay a tax obligation where: • the directors of a company facing significant liquidity problems because of the effects of COVID-19 and the resulting economic climate decide in good faith to rely on the safe harbour and continue carrying on business; or • as a result of the directors’ decision to rely on the safe harbour, the company continues carrying on business and trading, or incurs new obligations on ordinary commercial business terms (for example, bank loans or sales at credit). 85. However, s HD 15 of the ITA and s 61 of the GSTA will still apply to any arrangement that would ordinarily be subject to the provision, notwithstanding that the arrangement was entered into during the safe harbour period following a company’s directors’ decision to rely on the safe harbour. Examples 86. The following examples illustrate the general approach to the application of s HD 15 of the ITA and s 61 of the GSTA in the context of the COVID-19 safe harbour. Example One: section HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply Shoe Co is a retail company that is facing significant liquidity problems due to the impact of COVID-19. The directors of Shoe Co seek advice from their lawyers. The lawyers advise that Shoe Co can continue trading on the basis that: - the directors consider, in good faith, that Shoe Co is facing significant liquidity issues as a result of COVID-19; - Shoe Co was able to pay its debts as they fell due in the normal course of business on 31 December 2019; and - the directors consider, in good faith, that it is more likely than not that Shoe Co will be able to pay its debts as they fall due on and after 30 September 2021. In May 2020, the directors resolve to keep trading and document their reliance on the safe harbour exemption. The directors are confident that the company will return to profitability within the next 18 months. Shoe Co enters into a long-term loan with the bank so they have funds to pay staff and carry out important maintenance work. Shoe Co also negotiates an instalment arrangement with the Commissioner in relation to an income tax obligation that arose before New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown. Ultimately, these steps prove insufficient to save Shoe Co, and the directors resolve to place the company into liquidation. At that time, Shoe Co’s assets are inadequate for it to fully meet its outstanding debts. Nearly half of the income tax obligation remains outstanding and cannot be paid. Shoe Co has a tax liability that cannot be met, but there is no arrangement that has the purpose of depleting Shoe Co’s assets in a way that is designed to have the effect that the tax liability could not be met. Accordingly, s HD 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not apply. Example Two: Section 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 could apply Food Co has operated a successful restaurant near a popular tourist spot for several years. Food Co saw a significant downturn in business due to the impact of COVID-19. In May 2020, it was struggling to pay its debts as they became due. In June 2020, the directors of Food Co resolved to continue trading despite Food Co’s financial difficulties, taking comfort that they were within the newly enacted safe harbour in schedule 12 of the Companies Act 1993. At that time, the directors were of the view, in good faith, that Food Co: - was facing significant liquidity issues as a result of COVID-19; 16 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] - was able to pay its debts as they fell due in the normal course of business on 31 December 2019; and - would return to profitability once overseas tourists were able to return, so it is more likely than not that Food Co will be able to pay its debts as they fall due on and after 30 September 2021. Later in 2020, Food Co’s situation has somewhat improved. The directors, however, remained concerned about the long-term prospects for Food Co. At that time, the directors resolve to sell the assets of the company to John, the sole shareholder in Food Co. Rather than selling the assets for market value, they resolve to sell them to John for a nominal sum. Following the sale, Food Co has insufficient funds to pay the GST owing on the sale of the assets (which is treated as have been made for open market value under s 10(3)). The sale of the assets to John is an arrangement entered into in relation to Food Co that has the purpose of depleting Food Co’s assets. An effect of the arrangement is that Food Co is unable to pay its GST obligations, as it has insufficient funds to fully pay the GST due on the sale of the assets. Objectively, that effect is a purpose of the arrangement, and therefore s 61 of the GSTA could apply. 17 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] References Subject references COVID-19 safe harbour Directors’ liability Legislative references Companies Act 1993, ss 135, 136, 138B, schedule 12 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, s 61 Income Tax Act 1994, s HK 11 Income Tax Act 2004, s HK 11 Income Tax Act 2007, s HD 15 Official Information Act 1982, s 6 Tax Administration Act 1994, s 91D Case references AMP Life Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,940 (HC) Auckland Harbour Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,433 (CA) BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,732 (HC) Case X11 (2005) 22 NZTC 12,175 CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd (2001) 20 NZTC 17,103 (CA) CIR v BNZ Investments Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 450 CIR v Haenga (1985) 7 NZTC 5,198 (CA) Claremont Petroleum NL v Cummings (1992) 110 ALR 239 (FCA) Commissioner of Police v Ombudsman \[1985\] 1 NZLR 578 (HC) Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 (SC) Henderson v CIR \[2016\] NZHC 1987, (2016) 27 NZTC 22,068 (HC) Newton v FCT \[1958\] 2 All ER 759 (PC) Peterson v CIR \[2005\] UKPC 5 Russell v CIR (No 2) (2010) 24 NZTC 24,463 (HC) Russell v CIR \[2012\] NZCA 128 Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 (CA) Spencer v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,818 (HC) Strachan v Marriott \[1995\] 3 NZLR 272 (CA) Vinyl Processors (New Zealand) Ltd v Cant \[1991\] 2 NZLR 416 (HC) Other references Concise Oxford English Dictionary (12 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2011) Companies Office, “‘Safe harbour’ for company directors” (web page, 2020, https://companies- register.companiesoffice.govt.nz/help-centre/company-directors/safe-harbour-for-company-directors (accessed 29 June 2020)).

Section HD 15 states: HD 15 Asset stripping of companies When this section applies (1) This section applies when— (a) an arrangement has been entered into in relation to a company; and (b) an effect of the arrangement is that the company cannot meet a tax liability (the tax obligation) whether existing at the time of the arrangement or arising after that time, for— (i) income tax: (ii) a civil penalty, as defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994: (iii) an amount payable under Part 7 of that Act; and (c) it is reasonable to conclude that— (i) a purpose of the arrangement is to have the effect described in paragraph (b); and (ii) if a director of the company at the time of the arrangement made reasonable inquiries, they could have anticipated at the time that the income tax liability would, or would likely, be required to be met. When this section does not apply (2) This section does not apply to an arrangement if— (a) the Commissioner is a party to the arrangement: (b) the tax obligation is no more than an amount of income tax that arises as a direct result of the performance of the arrangement, and that obligation has been met: (c) at the time of the arrangement, the company was under statutory management under the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 or the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989. Director’s liability (3) All persons who are directors of the company at the time the arrangement is entered into are treated as agents of the company in relation to the tax obligation, and the liability is joint and several. But a director has no liability if— (a) they do not derive a benefit from the arrangement, and at the first reasonable opportunity after becoming aware of the arrangement, or the aspects of the arrangement that cause this section to apply to it, they record formally their dissent in relation to the arrangement with the company and with the Commissioner; or (b) they were not at the relevant time involved in the executive management of the company and had no knowledge of the arrangement, or the aspects of the arrangement that cause this section to apply to it. Shareholder’s liability (4) A person who is a controlling shareholder or an interested shareholder at the time of the arrangement is treated as an agent of the company in relation to the tax obligation other than penalties and interest but, despite section HD 3(2), the liability is limited to the greater of— (a) the market value of the person’s direct and indirect shareholding in the company at the time of the arrangement; and (b) the value of the benefit that the person derives from the arrangement. 19 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Shareholder’s liability for penalties and interest (5) A person who is a controlling shareholder or an interested shareholder at the time of the arrangement is treated as an agent of the company in relation to penalties and interest in proportion to their liability for the tax obligation under subsection (4). Company liquidations (6) In order to give effect to this section, if a company has been liquidated, the Commissioner may at any time after the liquidation make an assessment of a company for an income tax liability of the company as if it had not been liquidated. The time bar applies, but this subsection overrides other provisions in this Act and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Agents for purposes of notification or objection procedures (7) In making an assessment under subsection (6), the Commissioner must nominate 1 or more persons as having the tax obligation set out in the assessment. The nominated person or persons are treated as agents of the company in relation to any notification or objection procedure concerning the assessment. When liability does not arise (8) No liability arises under this section for a tax year in relation to which— (a) a company has provided returns within the time allowed by section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for providing returns for the tax year in which the company is liquidated; and (b) the Commissioner has not issued a notice of assessment of the company for the tax year before the end of 4 years following the end of the tax year in which the company is liquidated. Meaning of company in voting interest or market value interest tests (8B) When applying sections YC 2 to YC 6 (which relate to voting and market value interests) for the purposes of the definitions of controlling shareholder and interested shareholder in subsection (9), the reference to company in sections YC 2 to YC 6 includes a company that is acting in the capacity of trustee. Some definitions (9) In this section,— company includes a company that is acting in the capacity of trustee controlling shareholder, for a company, means— (a) a person whose voting interest or market value interest in the company at the time of the arrangement, together with any interests of an associated person, is 50% or more; and (b) if the person or associated person is a company, the voting interest or market value interest of the person or associated person is calculated as if they were not a company and as if sections YC 4 (Look-through rule for corporate shareholders) and YC 6 did not apply director means,— (a) a person who occupies the position of director, whether or not the position has that title: (b) for an entity that is treated as a company under this Act, a person who acts in the same or similar way as a director would if the entity were a company incorporated in New Zealand under the Companies Act 1993 interested shareholder means a person who, at the time the arrangement is entered into, has a voting interest or market value interest in the company, calculated in either case if the person is a company as if the person were not a company, and because of the size of the benefit that the person derives from the arrangement, it is reasonable to conclude that the person is a party to the arrangement penalties and interest means a civil penalty or amount payable under Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that is part of the tax obligation. 20 BR PUB 20/06 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 2.

Taxation laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(b), 6(4), 6(5), 8, 20, and 57(2)(b). The arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment of a person as a director (the Director) of a company (the Company). The engagement may be by direct contract between the Director and the Company. Alternatively, the Director may be engaged as a director of the Company under an agreement between the Company and: a third party (the Third Party); the Director’s employer (the Employer); or a partnership of which the Director is a partner (the Partnership). How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The Director contracts directly with the Company If the Director has not accepted the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity, then the: engagement is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b), and section 6(5) does not apply because the Director did not accept the office i n c arrying on the Director’s taxable activity; and Company cannot claim an input tax deduction for any directors’ fees paid to t he D irector because GST will not be charged on the supply of the Director’s services to the Company. If the Director has accepted the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity, then the following is the case: BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 41 The engagement is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, section 6(5) will apply and the services will be deemed to be s upplied in the course or furtherance of the Director’s taxable activity. If the Director is registered or liable to be registered for GST, the Director will be r equired to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of t he directorship services. If the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, the C ompany may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of the directorship services by the Director, provided t he o ther requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied. The Director’s services are contracted by the Third Party to the Company If the Third Party contracts with the Company to provide the Director’s services as a director of the Company and the Director has accepted the office, but not as part of carrying on a taxable activity, then the following is the case: The Director’s engagement as director of the Company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because t he D irector did not accept the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the Third Party’s provision of the Director’s services to the Company because the Third Party is not engaged as a director of the Company. If the Third Party is registered or liable to be registered for GST, the Third Party will be required to account for GST charged under section 8 o n t he supply of the Director’s services. If the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, t he C ompany may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of the Director’s services by the Third Party, provided the o ther requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied . I f the Third Party contracts with the Company to provide the Director’s services to the Company and the Director accepts the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity, then the following is the case: The Director’s engagement as a director of the Company is excluded from t he t erm “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, because the Director accepted the office in carrying on their taxable activity, section 6(5) applies and any directorship services provided by the Director are deemed to be supplied i n t he course or furtherance of the Director’s taxable activity. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 41 Two supplies are relevant for GST purposes: first, the Director providing their services to the Third Party and, secondly, the Third Party providing the Director’s services to the Company. For the first supply: othe Director is required to account for GST charged under section 8 on t he s upply of their services to the Third Party; and oif the Third Party is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, the Third Party may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for the GST charged on the supply of the Director’s services by the Director, provided the other requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied. For the second supply, the following is the case: oSection 6(3)(b) does not apply to the Third Party’s supply of the Director’s services to the Company because the Third Party is not engaged as a director of the Company. If the Third Party is registered or liable to be registered for GST, the Third Party is required to account for GST charged under section 8 on the supply of the Director’s services. oIf the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, the Company may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of the Director’s services by the Third Party, provided the other requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied. The Director’s services (as employee) are contracted by the Employer to the Company If the Director, as part of their employment, is engaged as a director of the Company under a contract between the Employer and the Company, the following is the case: The Director’s engagement as director of the Company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because t he D irector did not accept the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity. The office was accepted as part of the Director’s employment with the Employer. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the Employer’s supply of the Director’s services to the Company because the Employer is not engaged as a director of t he C ompany. If the Employer is registered or liable to be registered for GST, t he E mployer is required to account for GST charged under section 8 on the supply of the Director’s services to the Company. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 41 If the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, the C ompany may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of the Director’s services by the Employer, provided t he o ther requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied . The Director contracts their services directly to the Company and the Director is an employee who is obliged to account to their Employer for the director’s fees received The Director may be engaged by the Company to be a director of that company, where: the Director is an employee who is required to account to their Employer for the d irector’s fees received; there is no contract between the Company and the Employer; and the Director has not accepted the office in carrying on their own taxable activity. In this situation the following is the case: The Director’s engagement as director of the Company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because t he D irector did not accept the office in carrying on the Director’s taxable activity. Under section 6(4), any fees paid by the Company to the Director (and accounted for to the Employer) are treated as consideration for a supply of services by t he Employer to the Company. If the Employer is registered or liable to be registered for GST, then the Employer is required to account for GST charged under section 8 on this deemed supply. If the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, t he C ompany may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the deemed supply by the Employer, provided the other requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied. The Director’s services are contracted to the Company, and the Director is a partner in a partnership who is obliged to account to the Partnership for the director’s fees received If the Director is a partner in a partnership and accepts an office as a director of the Company as part of the Partnership’s business, then the Director is obliged to account to the Partnership for the director’s fees received: The Director’s engagement as director of the Company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply because, BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 41 although the Director may be carrying on the taxable activity of the Partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the Partnership under section 57(2)(b). Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the Partnership’s provision of the Director’s services to the Company because the Partnership is not engaged as a director of the Company. If the Partnership is registered or liable to be registered for GST the Partnership is required to account for GST charged under section 8 on t he supply of the Director’s services. If the Company is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST the Company may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of the Director’s services by the Partnership provided t he o ther requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied.

BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 2UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 41 The Organisation cannot claim an input tax deduction for any fees paid to the B oard Member because GST will not be charged on the supply of the Board Member’s services to the Organisation. If the Board Member has accepted the office in carrying on the Board Member’s taxable activity, then the following is the case: The engagement is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(c)(iii). However, section 6(5) will apply and the services will be d eemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the Board Member’s taxable activity. If the Board Member is registered or liable to be registered for GST, then the Board Member is required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of board member services. If the Organisation is carrying on a taxable activity and is registered for GST, t he O rganisation may claim a deduction for input tax under section 20(3) for any GST charged on the supply of board member services by the Board Member, provided the other requirements in the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are satisfied. The Board Member’s services are contracted by the Third Party to the Organisation If the Third Party contracts with the Organisation to provide the Board Member’s services to the Organisation and the Board Member has accepted the office, but not as part of carrying on a taxable activity, then the following is the case: The Board Member’s engagement as a board member of the Organisation is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) does not apply because the Board Member did not accept the office in carrying on the Board Member’s taxable activity. Section 6(3)(c)(iii) does not apply to the Third Party’s provision of the Board Member’s services to the Organisation because the Third Party is not engaged as a board member of the Organisation.

Taxation laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(c)(iia), 6(4), 6(5), 8, 20, and 57(2)(b). The arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an e ngagement, occupation, or employment as a chairman or member (the Board Member) of an organisation (the Organisation) pursuant to an appointment made by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council and evidenced by a warrant, an Order in Council or a notice published in the New Zealand Gazette. How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The Arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment of a person as a chairperson or member (the Board Member) of a local authority, board, council, committee, or other body (the Organisation). The engagement may be by direct contract between the Board Member and the Organisation. Alternatively, the Board Member may be engaged as a Board Member of the Organisation under an agreement between the Organisation and: a third party (the Third Party); the Board Member’s employer (the Employer); or a partnership of which the Board Member is a partner (the Partnership).

The Rulings and Commentary also consider whether a company engaging a director or an organisation engaging a board member is entitled to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to that director or board member. 2.The Rulings and Commentary set out the GST treatment for fees paid to a director or bo ard member in two broad categories. The first category is where the director o r bo ard member contracts either directly with a company or through a third party. T he s econd category is where a director or board member is either an employee of a third party or a partner in a partnership. The GST treatment of board members appointed by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council is different to the GST treatment for other board members (as explained from \[47\]). Until that part of this Commentary, the discussion of board members is generally about board members not appointed by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council. 3.A director or board member must charge GST on their supply of services when the di rector or board member: is registered or liable to be registered in respect of a taxable activity that they undertake; and accepts the office in carrying on that taxable activity. 4.A director or board member is not required to charge GST on their supply of services where they are engaged: as a director or board member in their capacity as an employee of a third-party employer; or in their capacity as a partner in a partnership. 5.Essentially, if a registered person accepts an office as a director or board member in carrying on their taxable activity, the fees that person receives for providing their services are subject to GST. 6.A flowchart that illustrates the GST treatment of directors’ or board members’ fees from a director’s or board member’s perspective is in Appendix 1. 7.Where the director or board member has been engaged in their capacity as an em ployee, they may be required to account for their fees to their employer. In this situation, the payment received by the employer is treated as consideration for a supply of services by the employer to the person who made the payment to t he d irector or board member (section 6(4)). If the employer is registered or liable to be BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 41 registered for GST, the employer is required to account for GST on this deemed supply to the company. 8.Where the director or board member has been engaged in their capacity as a partner in a partnership, the partnership is deemed to make the supply of services, rather tha n th e director. If the partnership is registered or liable to be registered for GST, t he pa rtnership is required to account for GST on the supply of the director’s services. 9.If a board member is appointed by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in C ouncil, the services that board member provides will always be excluded from t he d efinition of “taxable activity”. 10.From the perspective of a company or an organisation that engages a director o r bo ard member, the company or organisation may claim an input tax deduction for t he f ees it pays, if: the company or organisation is GST registered; an d GS T was charged on the directors’ or board members’ fees (or there was a deemed supply by an employer under section 6(4)) and the company o r o rganisation holds a tax invoice for those fees. 11.Other requirements of the Act may also need to be satisfied, depending on individual circumstance s. Background 12.The Rulings set out the Commissioner’s views on the GST treatment of directors’ fees and board members’ fees. This Commentary explains the reasoning adopted. 13.The previous ruling for directors’ fees, BR Pub 15/10, was issued on 29 June 2015 for an indefinite period with effect from 30 June 2014. 1 However, with the addition of the two rulings relating to board members’ fees and the expansion of this Commentary to cover both directors’ fees and board members’ fees, it has been decided to withdraw BR Pub 15/10 on 31 March 2023 and reissue the public ruling on GST and directors ’ f ees as BR Pub 23/01 with effect from 1 April 2023. 1 “Goods and services tax – directors’ fees”: Public Ruling BR Pub 15/10:, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 7 (August 2015): 3. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 41 14.BR Pub 15/10 replaced BR Pub 05/13 from 30 June 2014 for an indefinite period. 2 BR P ub05/13 itself replaced BR Pub 00/11 from 1 April 2005 for an indefinite period. 3 BR P ub 00/11 applied from 26 October 2000 to 31 March 2005. BR Pub 00/11 replaced BR Pub 00/09, which contained an application period that was seen to be r etrospective. 4 BR Pub 00/09 replaced policy items published in the Public Information Bulletin in 1987 and 1988. 5 Summary of the legislation 15.This part of the Commentary summarises the legislation relevant to whether: directors’ fees and board members’ fees are subject to GST; and a company or an organisation is entitled to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to a director or board member who is also an employee of a third-party employer. Scheme of the Act 16.Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in N ew Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtheranc e o f a taxable activity carried on by that person. GST is regarded as a transactions tax because it is imposed on supplies of goods and services. On this basis, it is the contractual relationship between the parties (founded on a genuine basis) that determines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 (CA)). 17.GST is imposed on supplies made by registered persons. A “registered person” is a person who is registered or liable to be registered for GST (s ection 2). A person may be liable to be registered for GST, if the value of their total supplies in New Zealand in a 12-month period exceeds the threshold amount in section 51. However, to be liabl e t o account for GST, a registered person must carry on a “taxable activity”. 2 “Directors’ fees and GST”: Public Ruling – BR Pub 05/13, T ax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005): 9. 3 “ Directors’ fees and GST”: Public Ruling – BR Pub 00/11, T ax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 11 (November 2000): 3. 4 “Directors’ fees and GST”: Public Ruling – BR Pub 00/09, T ax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000): 9. 5 “GST on directors’ fees”, Public Information Bulletin 164 (August 1987); “GST on directors’ fees”, Public Information Bulletin 175 (July 1988). BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 41 Requirements of a “taxable activity” 18.Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Section 6(1) defines a taxable activity as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods and services to another perso n f or a consideration. Therefore, a person conducts a taxable activity when all of t he f ollowing characteristics are present: There is some form of activity. The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. 19.The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. 20.Under section 6(2) anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Exclusions from the definition of “taxable activity” 21.Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Relevantly, for the purposes of the Rulings and this Commentary, excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” are any engagement, occupation, or employment: of a person as a director (section 6(3)(b)); under an appointment made by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council and evidenced by a warrant, an Order in Council or a notice published in the New Zealand Gazette (section 6(3)(c)(iia)); or. as a Chairman or member of any local authority or any statutory board, council, committee, or other body (section 6(3)(c)(iii)) (and note, for ease of reference, this Commentary uses the term “board member” to apply to all the situations that fall within section 6(3)(c)(iii)). 6 Section 6(5) and limitations on the section 6(3) exclusions 22.However, in certain circumstances a director or board member can be deemed to provide their services as part of a taxable activity under section 6(5). Section 6(5) 6 This Commentary also refers to “board members” in respect of Governor-General and Governor- General in Council appointments as that is the relevant subset of appointments of relevance for BR Pub ZZ/zz and this Commentary. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 41 applies where a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts an office as director or board member. Section 6(5) applies to a person appointed as a director who would otherwise be excluded under section 6(3)(b) and to a person appointed as a board member who would otherwise be excluded under section 6(3)(c)(iii). In these situations, any services provided by the director or board member are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the person’s taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST-registered sole trader accepts a directorship or board membership in carrying on their taxable activity, section 6(5) applies and the sole trader is liable to return GST on any director’s fees or board member’s fees received. Section 6(5) does not apply to appointments by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council that are excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(c)(iia). 23.If the person holds several offices (as director or board member), those offices, on their own and even when combined, are not a taxable activity. Each individual office is excluded from the meaning of “taxable activity” under sections 6(3)(b) and/o r 6 (3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) cannot apply in this situation unless the office holder accepts the office in carrying on some other taxable activity separate to the holding of directorships or board memberships. For example, if a person held multiple d irectorships (such that they could be described as a “professional director”), and also had a legal or accounting or consulting practice in relation to which the opportunity for those directorships arose, then section 6(5) could apply. (Just to be clear, section 6(5) can apply whether there is one office or multiple offices accepted.) Where t he s eparate taxable activity ceases to exist, and the person currently only holds a number of offices (directorships or board memberships), then section 6(5) would not apply. That is, it is not enough that the office was originally accepted in carrying on a taxabl e a ctivity, that taxable activity must continue. 24.Examples 1 and 2 below illustrate circumstances in which section 6(5) may or may not apply because the directorship (or board membership) was or was not accepted i n c arrying on a taxable activity. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 41 Example 1 - Is an office accepted in carrying on a taxable activity? Variation 1 - Directorship accepted in carrying on a taxable activity Eriksen has a shop (“ Danes-R-Us”) selling sporting gear, including supporters merchandise (replica shirts, scarves and so on) for Elsinore FC, the local football club. Danes-R-Us is a great supporter of Elsinore FC and supports many initiatives of the club to increase support at the games and for youth player participation at the club. These include giving away free tickets to matches as part of in-store promotions, providing free transport for youth players to get to out-of-town matches and so on. In recognition of the support of Eriksen and Danes-R-Us the club asks Eriksen to join the board of directors of Elsinore FC and he agrees to do so. Although section 6(3)(b) applies to exclude the directorship from the definition of “taxable activity”, section 6(5) brings the directorship back into the definition of “taxable activity” as it was accepted by Eriksen in carrying on a taxable activity (Danes-R-Us). The directorship was offered because of the activities Eriksen and Danes-R-Us undertook to benefit the club in the course of carrying on the taxable activity of selling sporting gear. Variation 2 - Directorship not accepted in carrying on a taxable activity Assume Danes-R-Us has the same taxable activity. However, Danes-R-Us does not support any initiatives of Elsinore FC. Instead, Eriksen, in his own time and at his own expense, supports the club by assisting with fundraising for junior teams, providing free transport to practices and games for youth players, and organising supporters’ club functions. In recognition of the support of Eriksen the club asks him to join the board of directors of Elsinore FC and he agrees to do so. Section 6(3)(b) applies to exclude the directorship from the definition of “taxable activity”. Section 6(5) does not apply to bring the directorship back into the definition of “taxable activity” as it was not accepted by Eriksen in carrying on a taxable activity (Danes-R-Us). Instead, the directorship was offered in recognition of his efforts outside of the taxable activity. In light of the particular activity of Danes-R-Us (sporting gear sales including Elsinore FC merchandise) a careful consideration of the facts would be critical. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 41 Example 2 - Is an office accepted in carrying on a taxable activity? Variation 1 - Directorship not accepted in carrying on a taxable activity Cornelius is a butcher in Elsinore and a good friend of Eriksen. She is also a great supporter of Elsinore FC. She spends many hours of her own time coaching the club’s women’s team, running a branch of the supporters’ club, and lobbying the local council to provide enhanced sporting facilities for young girls and women who wish to play football. Elsinore FC asks Cornelius to become a director of the club in recognition of her efforts, and she agrees to do so. Section 6(3)(b) applies to exclude the directorship from the definition of “taxable activity”. Section 6(5) does not apply to bring the directorship back into the definition of “taxable activity” as it was not accepted in carrying on her taxable activity as a butcher. Instead, the directorship was offered in recognition of her efforts outside of her taxable activity as a butcher.. Variation 2 - Directorship accepted in carrying on a taxable activity As above, Cornelius is a butcher in Elsinore but she is not a football fan or supporter of Elsinore FC. However, she recognises the club’s popularity in the local community and wants to tap into that to promote her business, Ham-4-All. As a result Ham-4-All finances the club’s junior teams, participates in free ticket giveaways at the store, and contributes to the cost of redeveloping the club’s ground. Elsinore FC asks Cornelius to become a director of the club in recognition of Ham-4-All’s support and she agrees to do so. Although section 6(3)(b) applies to exclude the directorship from the definition of “taxable activity”, section 6(5) brings the directorship back into the definition of “taxable activity” as it was accepted by Cornelius in carrying on the taxable activity of Ham-4-All. The directorship was offered because of the activities the business undertook to benefit the club. Deemed supplies by employers 25.A company may engage a person as a director or board member who is an employee o f a third-party employer. An employer may agree to an employee being engaged as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation on the condition tha t t he employee accounts to the employer for any directors’ fees or board members’ fees received. In this situation, the company or organisation would ordinarily be precluded from claiming any GST input tax deductions on director’s fees or board member’s fees BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 41 paid to the employee of a third-party employer. The reason for this is that, generally, the employee would not be carrying on a taxable activity. This is because the term “taxable activity” excludes any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service: section (s ection 6(3)(b)). 26.Section 6(4) was introduced to allow a company or organisation to claim input tax deductions for fees paid to a director or board member who is an employee of a third- party employer. Section 6(4) provides that when an employee of a third-party employer is engaged by a company or an organisation to be a director or board member and the employee is required to account for any fees received to their employer, the employer is deemed to make a supply of services to the company or organisation. Section 6(4) applies to genuine employment relationships where the employee has a fiduciary obligation to account to their employer for any fees from an office. Therefore, a GST registered employer is liable for GST output tax on the s upply of the services and the company or organisation can claim input tax on t he pa yment for those services if they are also GST registered. For more information on the introduction of this subsection, see “Directors’ fees” in the August 2014 Tax Information Bulletin. 7 Application of the legislation 27.These Rulings consider the GST treatment of the supply of services as a director o r bo ard member. Except where a board member is appointed by the Governor-General or Governor-General in Council, the tests for determining whether a director or board member is carrying on a taxable activity, and their subsequent tax treatment, are t he s ame. 28.The following analysis explains the GST treatment of supplies of services provided by a director or board member when a person (with or without a taxable activity) is engaged in their personal capacity as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation; a person (with or without a taxable activity) is contracted as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation by a third party; an employee of a third-party employer is engaged as a director of a company o r a board member of an organisation; an d 7 “ Directors’ fees”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26, No 7 (August 2014): 96. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 41 a partner in a partnership is engaged as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation. 29.In analysing any office holder appointment it will be critical to understand the legal effect of the arrangements entered into. Careful consideration will need to be given to the capacity in which an office is accepted and whether the office holder is legally obliged to account to another party for the fees received. It is important that in each situation there is clarity as to which of the categories listed in paragraph \[28\] apply. Director or board member 8 engaged in their personal capacity 30.A person may accept an office as a director or board member in their personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. Alternatively, a person may accept an office as a director or board member as part of carrying on their taxable activity. 31.If the person accepts an office in their personal capacity and not as part of carrying on a taxable activity, then the activity of supplying services as a director or board member falls within the exclusion in section 6(3)(b) or section 6(3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) does no t a pply because the person has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxabl e a ctivity. See Example 3. 32.However, if the director or board member has accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity, section 6(5) overrides the exclusions in section 6(3)(b) and sectio n 6 (3)(c)(iii) and deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the director or board member is registered or liable to be registered for GST, the director or board member will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the services they supply. See Example 4. 8 In the diagrams the term “officer” is used to refer to either a director or a board member. Officer Company or Organisation BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 41 Example 3: Director engaged in their personal capacity and does not have taxable activity Claudius, who is not registered for GST, is an employee of a marketing agency. Fortinbras Ltd engages Claudius as a director and pays him fees for his services. The appointment of Claudius as a director is not connected with his employment, nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Claudius is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply, because Claudius did not accept the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Claudius is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Fortinbras Ltd cannot claim input tax deductions on the fees paid to Claudius because no GST was charged on those fees. Example 4: Board member engaged in their personal capacity and has a taxable activity Ophelia is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. Ophelia accepts a position as a member of the Elsinore Employment Equality Council (“the EEEC”) as part of carrying on her taxable activity. She receives fees for her services. Because Ophelia has accepted the office as part of carrying on her taxable activity, section 6(5) deems her services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. Therefore, Ophelia should provide the EEEC with a tax invoice and account for GST output tax on the fees she is paid. The EEEC may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Ophelia, provided the requirements of the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are met. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 41 Director or board member contracted to company or organisation by third party 33.A third party may agree to provide the services of a director or board member to a company or an organisation. In this situation, two supplies are relevant for GST purposes. The first supply is the director or board member providing their services to the third party. The second supply is the third party providing the director’s or board member’s services to the company or organisation. 34.In relation to the first supply, the director or board member may accept the office in the c ourse or furtherance of a taxable activity. If the office is not accepted in t he c ourse or furtherance of a taxable activity, the director’s or board member’s engagement is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b) o r s ection 6(3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) would not apply because the director’s or board member’s services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, there can be no supply for GST purposes between the director or board member an d th e third party. See Example 5. 35.However, if the director or board member accepts the office in carrying on a taxable a ctivity, section 6(5) deems the director’s or board member’s services to be supplied i n t he course or furtherance of their taxable activity. In this situation, the director o r bo ard member will invoice the third party for providing the director’s or board member’s services. Therefore, the director or board member is required to account for GST output tax on the fees they receive for these services. See Example 6. 36.In relation to the second supply, the third party invoices the company or organisation for the third party’s services in providing the director’s or board member’s services. If the third party is registered or liable to be registered for GST, they are required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the supply of the director’s o r bo ard member’s services. Section 6(3)(b) will not apply because the third party is not engaged as a director of a company or as a board member of an organisation. Officer Company or Organisation Third Party 2 1 BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 of 41 Example 5: Director contracted to company by third party and does not have taxable activity A GST-registered financial management company, Polonius Ltd, agrees to supply Osric Ltd with the services of a director. Polonius Ltd supplies the services of Marcellus, one of its specialist employees, to Osric Ltd. Directors’ fees are paid by Osric Ltd to Polonius Ltd for the services provided by Marcellus. The engagement of Marcellus as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply as Marcellus has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Marcellus has accepted the office as part of his employment with Polonius Ltd. Therefore, Marcellus is not required to account for GST on the supply of his directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of Polonius Ltd because that company is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in consideration of Polonius Ltd providing the services of Marcellus to Osric Ltd. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of Polonius Ltd’s taxable activity and that company will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for this supply. If Osric Ltd is registered for GST, it may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Polonius Ltd, provided the requirements of the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are met. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 of 41 Example 6: Board member contracted to organisation by third party and has taxable activity Horatio is a GST-registered accountant in business on his own. A consulting firm, Voltimand Ltd, agrees to supply the EEEC (from Example 4) with the services of a board member to monitor the EEEC’s financial systems. Horatio agrees with Voltimand Ltd to provide his services as a board member of the EEEC. Two supplies are involved in this arrangement. First, Horatio provides his services to Voltimand Ltd. Secondly, Voltimand Ltd supplies the services of Horatio to the EEEC. Horatio’s engagement as a board member of the EEEC is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(c)(iii). However, as Horatio has accepted the office as part of carrying on his taxable activity as an accountant, section 6(5) deems his services as a board member to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. In relation to the first supply, Horatio is, therefore, required to account for GST output tax on the fees he receives from Voltimand Ltd for these services. In relation to the second supply, Voltimand Ltd’s supply of Horatio’s services to the EEEC does not fall within section 6(3)(c)(iii) because Voltimand Ltd is not engaged as a board member of an organisation. Provided Voltimand Ltd is registered or liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees received for the supply of Horatio’s services. If the EEEC is registered for GST, it may claim input tax deductions for the fees paid to Voltimand Ltd, provided the requirements of the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are met. Employee engaged as a director or board member 37.A company or an organisation may engage a person as director or board member who is also an employee of a third-party employer. In this situation, either the employ ee Employer Officer Company or Organisation BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 of 41 holds the office as part of their employment duties or the employee holds the office outside their employment. In this situation, no contract exists between the employer and the company or organisation. 38.If the employee holds the office outside their employment (the office does not arise f rom carrying on their employment), they are a director or board member in their personal capacity (see Examples 3 and 4 ). Because the director or board member is also an employee, it is unlikely they will have a taxable activity, but this will depend o n t he circumstances of each case. 39.Sometimes an employer will permit an employee to accept an office, provided the em ployee accounts to the employer for the fees received. If the employee has accepted the office in the course of their employment, the engagement of t he em ployee as a director or board member is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b) or section 6(3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) does not apply as the director or board member has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity— the director or board member is merely carrying out his or her employment duties. 40.Section 6(4) provides that when an employee is engaged as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation and the employee is required to account for any fees received to their employer, the payment is treated as consideration for a supply of services by the employer to the company or organisation. This is illustrated by t he f ollowing diagram: 41.The employer (provided it is registered or liable to be registered for GST) will, therefore, return GST output tax on the deemed supply of services and provide a tax invoice to the company or organisation. The company or organisation will t hen be a ble to claim input tax on the payment for these services. See Example 7. Employer Officer Company or Organisation BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 of 41 Example 7: Employee engaged as a director Guildenstern Ltd agrees to one of its employees, Laertes, taking up a directorship with Thebard Ltd on the proviso that Laertes accounts for the fees he receives to Guildenstern Ltd. No contract exists between Guildenstern Ltd and Thebard Ltd. Thebard Ltd is GST registered. The engagement of Laertes as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). Section 6(5) does not apply as Laertes has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, Laertes is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Guildenstern Ltd is treated as making a supply of services to Thebard Limited under section 6(4). If Guildenstern Ltd is registered or liable to be registered for GST it is required to account for GST on the supply of the services and provide a tax invoice to Thebard Limited. Because it is GST registered Thebard Ltd can claim an input tax deduction on the deemed supply from Guildenstern Limited. Partner in a partnership engaged as a director or board member 42.A partner in a partnership may be engaged as a director of a company or a board member of an organisation as part of the partnership’s business. 43.Section 2(1) defines “unincorporated body” to include a partnership. Section 57(2)(b) provides that where an unincorporated body carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity is deemed to be s upplied by the unincorporated body. If the unincorporated body is a partnership, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on its taxable activity is deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. Officer Company or Organisation Partnership BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 of 41 44.The engagement of the partner as a director or board member is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b) or section 6(3)(c)(iii). Section 6(5) does not apply because, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of t he pa rtnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership, not t he pa rtner, under section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of their services. 45.Section 6(3)(b) and section 6(3)(c)(iii) do not apply in the case of the partnership as the pa rtnership is not engaged as a director or board member. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to another person as part of its taxable activity. Therefore, the partnership will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director or board member. The partnershi p s hould also provide the company or organisation with a tax invoice. 46.While section 6(4) does not apply in this situation, the company or organisation will s till be able to claim input tax on the payment for the director’s or board member’s services. This is because the partnership is deemed to supply the partner’s services under section 57(2)(b) with a similar effect to section 6(4). See Example 8. Example 8: Partner in a partnership engaged as board member of an organisation A GST-registered legal partnership provides legal advice to the Rosencrantz Memorial Board (“the RMB”). A partner in the partnership, Gertrude, is elected on to the board of the RMB as a representative of the partnership. The RMB is GST registered. The engagement of Gertrude as a board member of an organisation falls within section 6(3)(c)(iii)), so is excluded from the term “taxable activity”. Section 6(5) does not apply as, although Gertrude may be providing the board member services, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership under section 57(2)(b). Therefore, Gertrude is not required to account for GST on the supply of the board member services. The provisions of section 6(3)(c)(iii) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a board member of an organisation. Therefore, the partnership will be required to account for GST output tax on the fees it receives from the organisation. The RMB may claim an input tax deduction on Gertrude’s board member services that the partnership invoices it for, provided the requirements of the Act, such as those in section 20(2), are met. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 of 41 Board members appointed by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council 47.Appointments made by the Governor-General are generally personal in nature. For example, board members may be appointed by the Governor-General to statutory entities. This means some of the situations described above will not arise where t he Go vernor-General appoints a board member. For example, the following situations will not arise in the context of a Governor-General appointment: a third party contracts with a board member to provide board member services to an organisation; and an employee of an employer is engaged as a board member of a third-party organisation in their capacity as an employee (although an employee may be appointed as a board member and be obliged to account to their employer for any board member’s fees they receive). 48.Section 6(5) does not apply to the appointment of a person as a board member by the Go vernor-General. This means that any activities relating to the services provided by a board member appointed by the Governor-General are always excluded from t he d efinition of “taxable activity” (section 6(3)(c)(iia)). See Example 9. 49.Where the Governor-General appoints a board member who is a partner in a partnership and the person supplies their services in the course of carrying on t he pa rtnership’s taxable activity, the services are deemed to be supplied by th e pa rtnership under section 57(2)(b). The partnership’s provision of the board member’s services does not fall within section 6(3)(c)(iia) because the partnership is not engaged as a board member. If the partnership is registered or liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account for GST output tax charged under section 8 on the supply of the board member’s services to the organisation. BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 of 41 Example 9 – Board member appointed by the Governor-General The empowering legislation for the Elsinore Preservation Association provides that appointments to the Association must be made by the Governor-General. The Governor-General appoints Francisco and Reynaldo to the Association. Both appointees accept the appointment and undertake services for the Association for which they are paid fees. The engagement of Francisco and Reynaldo as board members falls within section 6(3)(c)(iia), so is excluded from the term “taxable activity”. Section 6(5) does not apply as that provision does not apply to appointments covered by section 6(3)(c)(iia). Accordingly, neither Francisco nor Reynaldo should charge GST on their supply of services. The Association may not claim an input tax deduction on Francisco’s and Reynaldo’s board member services as there is no output tax charged on the fees for those services. When the company or organisation may claim an input tax deduction for fees it pays 50.As seen, a person may accept an office of director or board member in different capacities. Depending on the capacity in which the director or board member accept s t he office, the company or organisation may receive a tax invoice from the director o r bo ard member, the director’s or board member’s employer, the director’s or board member’s partnership, or a third party. It is not up to the company or organisation to determine the capacity in which the director or board member accepted the office. 51.Section 6(4) applies where a director of a company or board member of an organisation is also employed by a third-party employer and the director or board member must account for their fees to that employer. In this situation, section 6(4) provides that the payment to the employer is treated as consideration for a supply of services by the employer to the company or organisation paying the director or board member. If the director’s or board member’s employer is registered for GST, they w ill be a ble to provide a tax invoice to the company or organisation for the deemed supply of services. 52.Essentially, the company or organisation may claim an input tax deduction for the fees it pays if the: company or organisation is GST registered; an d BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 of 41 company or organisation holds a tax invoice for the directors’ fees or board members’ fees (or an invoice for a deemed supply by an employer under sectio n 6( 4)). Other requirements of the Act may also need to be satisfied, depending on individual circumstances.

About this document Public Rulings are issued by the Tax Counsel Office. Public Rulings set out the Commissioner’s view on how tax laws apply to a specific set of facts – called an arrangement. Taxpayers whose circumstances match the arrangement described in a Public Ruling may apply the ruling but are not obliged to do so. Public Rulings are binding on the Commissioner. This means that if you are entitled to apply a Public Ruling and you have calculated your tax liability in accordance with the ruling, the Commissioner must accept that assessment. A Public Ruling applies only to the taxation laws and arrangement set out in the ruling, and only for the period specified in the ruling. It is important to note that a general BR Pub 23/01–23/03 | 22 February 2023 UNCLASSIFIED Page 41 of 41 similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and the arrangement covered by a Public Ruling will not necessarily lead to the same tax result.

RELATED DOCUMENTS | TUHINGA WHAI PĀNGA IS XX/XX: Income tax – identifying the relevant item of property for depreciation purposes Tax Information Bulletin Vol X, No X (MMMYYYY):\[page\]. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 2 of 6 Introduction | Whakataki 1. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains rules that permit depreciation loss deductions for assets used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving assessable income. The permitted deductions are based on a proportion of the cost of the asset. The proportion or depreciation rate is fixed by the Commissioner for assets of that type and is based on the asset’s estimated useful life. 2. Accordingly, the identity of the item of property will determine its cost and the depreciation method and rate. The identity of the item of property may also determine other matters such as whether the item:  is an item of low value, meaning its cost can be deducted in full in the year of acquisition; or  can be depreciated using the pool method of depreciation; and  whether specific rules for certain types of property apply. 3. In addition to correctly identifying the relevant item of tangible property, other requirements must be met under the Act before a deduction for a depreciation loss will arise. These requirements are that the:  taxpayer owns the item of property;  property is depreciable property;  property is used, or is available for use, to derive assessable income; and  depreciation loss is calculated in the correct manner (ie, using the correct method and rate). These additional requirements are not discussed in IS XX/XX: Income tax – identifying the relevant item of property for depreciation purposes. For more information on how to claim depreciation, see Inland Revenue: Te hekenga wāriu - Depreciation (w ebpage, Inland Revenue, last updated 26 July 2021). 4. The Commissioner has also published specific guidance that considers this topic where identifying the relevant item of property is needed to determine certain income tax matters. Where it applies, the specific guidance should be consulted instead of IS XX/XX. The specific guidance is listed at the end of this factsheet. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 3 of 6 Key points 5. Identifying the relevant item of property is always a question of fact and involves matters of degree and impression. In many cases, this identification will be relatively straightforward. However, in some cases it may be unclear whether an item is a standalone item of property or part of another item of property. The listing of an asset in a table of depreciation rates is not determinative of the treatment of an asset a taxpayer owns because the test will be the use of the asset in a particular taxpayer’s circumstances. This means the same item of property may be treated differently by different taxpayers. 6. The focus is on identifying a physical thing that satisfies a particular notion. That is, something that is an entirety by itself and not a subsidiary part of anything else. 7. The focus is not on the item’s operational or economic significance, on finding a profit- earning entity or on abstract concepts separate from the item’s physical components. 8. There are factors that indicate whether the item under consideration is or is not an item of property for a particular taxpayer. Indicators that the item under consideration is an item of property in its own right include the following:  The item is physically distinct from a wider asset of which the item might be a part. Consider whether the item can be separately identified by physical factors (eg, location or size). Determine the item’s function (ie, the practical use to which it is put) and consider whether this function is integral to the physical functioning of a wider asset of which the item may be a part. Also relevant is the relative size of the item, whether it can be relocated and the degree of physical attachment between items (ie, whether they can be easily separated or whether this would result in significant damage to either item or both items).  The item is (to some degree) functionally complete. Functional completeness is about whether the item can function on its own. However, this does not necessarily mean the item needs to be self-contained or used separately.  The item varies the function of another item. Two items will tend to remain separate items where one item varies the function of another item, enabling it to perform a more specialised function. 9. Indicators the item under consideration is not an item of property for a particular taxpayer include the following:  The item has a physical connection with other items. Where a degree of physical connection exists between the item under consideration and other items this IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 4 of 6 may indicate the item is not a separate item of property. This may indicate the item is not physically distinct from a wider item.  The item is part of an integrated system. Being physically separate from other items does not necessarily mean the item is a separate item of property where the item is part of an integrated system designed to function as a whole. In that case, the item may lack functional distinctiveness.  The item is a necessary part to complete something else. An item under consideration will tend not to be a separate item of property if it is a necessary part to complete some other item. This relates to the concept of “completeness” and whether the other item would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item under consideration. 10. These indicators are often the inverse expression of another and can be reduced to the form shown in Figure | Hoahoa 1. Figure | Hoahoa 1: Determining whether something is an item of property 11. If the answer is that something is part of another item of depreciable property, then the expenditure is added to the cost or adjusted tax value of that item. If the answer is that something is a separate item of property, then it can be depreciated in its own right.

This statement considers how to identify an item of property to enable taxpayers to correctly determine the availability of, and amount of, any depreciation loss deductions they may be entitled to claim. 2. The courts have approached this exercise on the basis that the answer is always a question of fact and involves matters of degree and impression. The listing of an item in a table of depreciation rates set by the Commissioner is not by itself determinative of the depreciation treatment of an item because the test will be based on the use of the item in a particular taxpayer’s circumstances. This means the same item of property may be treated differently in respect of different taxpayers. 3. The focus is on identifying a physical thing that satisfies a particular notion. That is, something that is an entirety by itself and not a subsidiary part of anything else. 4. The focus is not on the item’s operational or economic significance or on finding a profit-earning entity or on abstract concepts separate from the item’s physical components. 5.

This interpretation statement provides general guidance for identifying the relevant item of tangible property when applying the depreciation rules of the Act. 1 9. The statement does not address how to distinguish expenditure that is capital in nature from that which is revenue in nature. It is assumed that a taxpayer has incurred capital expenditure and is concerned with identifying what the expenditure was for when applying the depreciation rules. 10. In addition to correctly identifying the relevant item of tangible property, other requirements must be met under the Act before a deduction for a depreciation loss will arise. Broadly, these additional requirements are that the:  taxpayer owns the item of property; 2  property is depreciable property; 3  property is used, or is available for use, to derive assessable income; 4 and  depreciation loss is calculated in the correct manner (ie, using the correct method and rate). 5 These additional requirements are not discussed in this statement. 6 11. The statement does not consider any rules that may apply to some items of property that may then affect whether they are treated as part of another item or are able to be depreciated separately. For example, whether an item is part of a commercial fit-out of a building or is part of a network for the distribution or conveying of electricity, gas, water or telecommunications. 7 1 This statement does not apply to intangible property. 2 Sections EE 1(2)(a) and EE 2 to EE 5. 3 Sections EE 1(2)(b) and EE 6 to EE 8. 4 Section EE 1(2)(c). 5 Sections EE 1(2)(d) and EE 9 to EE 11. 6 For more information on the application of the depreciation rules, see Inland Revenue: Te hekenga wāriu - Depreciation (webpage, Inland Revenue, last updated 26 July 2021). 7 See “commercial fit-out”, “utilities distribution asset”, “utilities distribution network” and “utilities distribution network operator” as defined in s YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 6 of 39 Relationship to other published guidance 12. This statement considers the issue of identifying an item of property in general terms. The Commissioner has published specific guidance that should be consulted instead of this statement where identifying the relevant item of property is needed to determine:  the deductibility of: o certain expenditure related to dairy farming (IS0025); 8 o expenditure on residential rental properties to meet the healthy homes standards (QB 20/01); 9  whether the relevant item is a separate item of property or part of a residential rental building (IS 10/01); 10 and  what is a “building” for depreciation purposes (IS 22/04). 11 13. There is also guidance on what to do if the relevant item of property has been incorrectly identified and an incorrect depreciation rate has been applied as a result. 12 14. As discussed from \[28\], an item of property is a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” or an “entirety”. In some cases, the specific guidance listed above has identified the particular notion or entirety that is relevant in the context of that guidance. For example, IS0025 refers to the “extraction of milk” as the particular notion in relation to milking plant. IS 10/01 and QB 20/01 appl y where the relevant entirety may be a residential rental property. IS 22/04 applies where the relevant entirety may be a building. 15. Also, in the context of residential rental properties, the specific guidance in IS 10/01 includes a practical test that, although not drawn from (or found in) any specific case, is 8 IS0025: Dairy farming – deductibility of certain expenditure Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000): 10. 9 QB 20/01: Can owners of existing residential rental properties claim deductions for costs incurred to meet Healthy Homes standards? Tax Information Bulletin Vol 32, No 7 (August 2020): 126. Healthy homes standards provide specific and minimum standards for heating, insulation, ventilation, moisture ingress and drainage, and draught stopping in rental properties: Healthy homes (webpage, Tenancy Services, 2024). 10 IS 10/01: Residential rental properties – depreciation of items of depreciable property Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010): 16. 11 IS 22/04: Claiming depreciation on buildings Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34, No 8 (September 2022): 9. 12 QB 15/03: Income tax – changing to a different depreciation rate for an item of depreciable property Tax Information Bulletin Vol 27, No 4 (May 2015): 30. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 7 of 39 consistent with the case law and is a useful tool to apply in that context. QB 20/01 also applies the test in the context of residential rental properties. 16. In summary, this statement supplements, but does not replace, the earlier specific guidance. Therefore, the specific guidance should be consulted where it is relevant to the particular notion or entirety involved. 17. Also, the principles that apply to identifying the relevant item of property in the specific guidance and in the general context dealt with in this statement are the same, including where the issue concerns the deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure. 13 Analysis | Tātari “Item of property” 18. The Act contains rules that permit depreciation loss deductions for assets used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving assessable income. 14 The permitted deductions are based on a proportion of the cost of the asset. The proportion or depreciation rate is fixed by the Commissioner for assets of that type and is based on the asset’s estimated useful life. If there is no appropriate depreciation rate, taxpayers can apply for a provisional rate. 15 19. The term used in the depreciation rules for an asset is an “item of property”. 16 Accordingly, when applying the depreciation rules, it is necessary to determine the relevant item of property to determine the appropriate depreciation rate to apply. 20. The identity of the item of property will determine its cost and whether that cost is below certain thresholds. These thresholds determine such things as whether the item:  is an item of low value, meaning its cost can be deducted in full in the year of acquisition; or  can be depreciated using the pool method of depreciation. 21. Other income tax matters may also depend on the correct identification of the item of property, including the following: 13 IS 12/03: Income tax – deductibility of repairs and maintenance expenditure - general principles Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 7 (August 2012): 68 at \[99\]. 14 Subpart EE. 15 See Depreciation – a guide for business – IR260 (guide, Inland Revenue, April 2023) at p33 – 34. 16 Section EE 1(2). The term “item of property” is not defined in the Act. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 8 of 39  Whether the expenditure is for a separate item of property or is an improvement of an existing item of depreciable property. While under s EE 37 improvements can be depreciated at a taxpayer’s option as if it were a separate item of depreciable property, the applicable depreciation rate is based on the item of depreciable property that is improved. 17  Whether the cost of the item is such that it qualifies as an item of low value under s EE 38. Subject to certain qualifications, s EE 38 provides a 100% depreciation rate to items of depreciable property costing no more than a certain amount (currently $1,000). Identifying the relevant item of property 22. The identity of the relevant item of property may be obvious in many cases but not in others. For example, it may not be obvious where:  two or more items are acquired or produced together, and the question arises as to whether they are separate items or have combined into a larger item of property;  an item acquired or produced relates to existing items of depreciable property, and the question arises as to whether the item is part of the existing item or items; or  an existing item has been, arguably, incorrectly identified. 23. In the third case listed, this may be where something has been incorrectly treated as forming part of a larger item of property when it is a separate item of property or where the opposite has occurred. 24. The fact an item has a depreciation rate determined by the Commissioner does not mean such an item is always treated as a separate item of property. 18 Nor is how a person has treated an item for accounting purposes or in a tax fixed asset register necessarily determinative, given the potential for earlier misidentification of the relevant item, as mentioned above. The item of property must be identified first according to the guidance set out in this statement and the other published guidance mentioned in \[12\]. Then, the depreciation rate is determined by finding in the Commissioner’s depreciation determinations the item description that most accurately describes the asset, as identified. 19 17 See IS 10/01 at \[8\]. 18 See QB 20/01 at \[30\] and IS 10/01 at \[62\]. 19 See QB 15/03 from \[13\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 39 25. The object of the exercise considered in this statement is to identify the relevant item of property. It is the same exercise as is conducted in the context of repairs or maintenance where the object is to identify the subject matter of the work completed to determine whether the expenditure incurred carrying out that work is deductible or capitalised to the cost base of the relevant asset. 20 26. The courts have approached this exercise on the basis that the answer is always a question of fact and involves matters of degree and impression. For example, in Auckland Trotting Club, 21 the Court of Appeal agreed with the views expressed in Phillips v Whieldon Sanitary Potteries 22 that “there is no one line of approach to the problem that is exclusively correct” and in Margrett 23 that the decision is “essentially a question of fact and of degree”. 24 In Hawkes Bay Power, the High Court stated that the question of what is the entirety was “a matter of degree and of the right conclusion to be drawn from the facts”. 25 And, in Case N8, the Taxation Review Authority stated “\[i\]t is a question of fact, degree and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity”. 26 27. Despite this, factors derived from the case law can indicate whether the item under consideration is or is not an item of property. 28. First, the courts have said the focus of the exercise is on identifying:  a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”; 27  something that is an “en tirety by itself” and “not ... a subsidiary part of anything else”; 28 and  “the totality or entirety of the physical asset”. 29 20 This is because the tests are derived from the same case law. This comes about because, historically, the rules for depreciating business assets and for claiming deductions for the cost of repairing and maintaining those same assets, were linked in the income tax legislation (s 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and IS 10/01 at \[45\]). 21 Auckland Trotting Club v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 (CA). 22 Phillips v Whieldon Sanitary Potteries Ltd (1952) TC 213 per Donovan J at 219. 23 Margrett v The Lowestoft Water & Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 per Finlay J at 488. 24 Auckland Trotting Club at 975 and 976. 25 Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 (HC) at 13,701. 26 Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052 (TRA) at 3,070. 27 Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 (FCHCA) at 384 adopted in Auckland Trotting Club (CA) at 975.

Court decisions also show that the focus is not on:  the operational significance or economic value of the item (including the need for the thing to be used in conjunction with other things or systems to realise that value); 30  a profit-earning structure or entity; 31 or  abstract concepts separate from the physical components of the item. 32 30. As discussed from \[32\], the decisions show indicators that suggest whether the item under consideration is or is not the relevant item of property. Due to the courts sometimes expressing the same or similar concept in differing terms, some of the indicators are a subset or an inverse of another. The weight to be given to each indicator and whether any one indicator is determinative depends on the circumstances. 31. Some indicators help determine if the item under consideration is the relevant item of property. These indicators include where the item is:  physically and functionally distinct from a wider asset that the item might be part of;  functionally complete (to some degree); or  varying the function of something else. 32. Some indicators suggest the item under consideration is not the relevant item of property. These indicators include where the item:  has a degree of physical connection with other items;  is part of an integrated system; or  is a necessary part of completing something else. Indicators the item is an item of property Physical and functional distinctness 33. The focus is to identify a “physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” or “an entirety”. It follows that a physical thing or entirety should, in some way or ways, be distinct from other things. The court decisions show that physical and functional 30 Auckland Gas (CA) at 15,026. 31 Auckland Gas (CA) at 15,019. 32 Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,702 (PC) at 15,707 per IS 12/03 at \[58\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 39 distinctness is a primary concern in such considerations. Distinctness is discussed in IS 1 2/03: 11. When considering whether something is a distinct asset it may be helpful to determine whether the thing can be separately identified by physical factors, for example, its location or size (Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 392 (Full Ct HCA), Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685 (HC), O’Grady (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Bullcroft Main Collieries Ltd (1932) 17 TC 93 (KB), Samuel Jones & Co (Devondale) Ltd v CIR (1951) 32 TC 513 (IH (1 Div)), Margrett (HM Inspector of Taxes) v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 (KB)). Something that is physically divisible and distinct from other things might suggest that it is a single asset (Case F67 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,897, O’Grady, Samuel Jones, Margrett). Also, a physical connection between component parts will often be relevant to finding a single asset (Auckland Gas (CA)). Subsidiary parts of an integrated system should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). 12. Similarly, determining something’s function may also be helpful when identifying the relevant asset being worked on (Auckland Gas (CA), Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power, Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052). A smaller thing that is integral to a larger asset’s ability to physically function is not likely to be the relevant asset (Hawkes Bay Power), while something that is physically capable of separate operation by itself is more likely to be the relevant asset in a repairs and maintenance context (Poverty Bay Electric, Hawkes Bay Power). \[Emphasis added\] 34. Other physical aspects mentioned in IS0025 include considering the relative size of the item and whether it can be relocated. IS 10/01 considers items that can be relocated within a residential rental building are more likely to be considered separate items of property. 33 IS 10/01 considers it is relevant to consider the degree of physical attachment between items such as whether an item is built-in or attached or connected to a building in such a way the item’s removal would be difficult or result in significant damage to the item, the building or both. 34 35. QB 20/01 considered determining whether a smaller thing is integral to a larger asset including any legal requirements with a bearing on the larger thing’s functionality. The need for a property to include certain things to meet regulations concerning healthy homes so the property fulfilled the notion of a “residential rental property” was considered. 35 33 See IS 10/01 at \[68\], \[202\] and \[215\]. 34 See step 3 of the three-step test set out in IS 10/01. 35 See QB 20/01 at \[11\] – \[13\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 12 of 39 36. For depreciation purposes, buildings are treated differently from other items of property (eg, claiming a loss on disposal is limited). IS 22/04 considers the appearance and function of a structure are relevant to determining whether the structure is a building for depreciation purposes. 36 37. In Case F67, in the context of identifying the item of property for repairs and maintenance purposes, Barber DJ considered that a rental property divided into two shops was a single item of property despite this division because the property functioned as one set of premises in terms of title, ownership, insurance and administration of the tenancies. 37 38. Since the publication of the earlier items of specific guidance, the Court of Appeal in Queenstown Airport Corporation Ltd considered whether runway end safety areas at the Queenstown airport were depreciable property. 38 This decision supports the view that an item of property for depreciation purposes is something with a separate function and is physically distinct. To be depreciable, the runway end safety areas had to fall within one of the categories of depreciable land improvement listed in schedule 13 of the Act. The taxpayer argued, among other things, that the runway end safety areas formed part of the wider runway system and fell within the term “airport runway” listed in schedule 13. The court decided that it did not, because the runway end safety areas were functionally and physically distinct from the airport runway. The court said: \[68\] We do not accept the appellant’s argument that the RESAs \[runway end safety areas\] are airport runways because they form part of the wider runway system. Mr Goddard submitted the airport could not lawfully be operated for international flights without the RESAs. He argued accordingly that they were an integral part of the overall runway system. For the Commissioner, Mrs Courtney accepted that RESAs could be regarded as part of the wider runway system but we accept her submission that the RESAs are functionally and physically distinct from the airport runway for the reasons we have already set out. \[Emphasis added\] 39. The reasons the court had earlier set out for runway end safety areas being functionally and physically distinct were that:  the runway had a bituminous surface on which aircraft took off and landed, whereas the runway end safety areas were grassed and not used by aircraft except in an emergency; 39 and 36 See IS 22/04 at \[33\]. 37 Case F67 (1983) 6 NZTC 59,897 (TRA). 38 Queenstown Airport Corporation Ltd v CIR \[2017\] NZCA 20. 39 At \[50\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 13 of 39  obvious distinctions existed between the runway and runway end safety areas in their usage and maintenance requirements, including that the runway: o had annual usage of about 8,000 take-offs and landings, whereas the runway end safety areas had not been used; and o was subject to significant loads and had a design life of 5 to 10 years, whereas the runway end safety areas required minimal maintenance and had a design life of 120 years. 40 40. In an Australian context concerned with a “unit of eligible property”, function was found to be a useful guide. For instance, in Tully (FCA), Lockhart J said: 41 Helpful though the dictionaries are they do not provide much practical guidance in determining the meaning of the expression “unit of eligible property” for present purposes. It is true that ultimately the question what constitutes “a unit of eligible property” depends on the facts of the particular case, but some guidance to the Commissioner and taxpayers is called for. In my view, the nearest one can get to enunciating a test of fairly general application is that it is the function or purpose of the particular item to which one looks to see if it answers the description on the facts of the case of “a unit of eligible property”. ... The difficulty of identifying a “unit of property” for the purposes of the Assessment Act is that sometimes an item may be correctly described as a “unit” when it is one of a number of parts which upon assembly perform a subsidiary function. Sometimes each part may be correctly described as a unit before assembly and at other times after assembly. On other occasions there may not be a unit until a number of parts have been integrated into a complete system. Then the whole may answer the description of a unit. The possibilities and combinations are numerous. But purpose or function must generally be a useful guide to the identification of an item as answering the description of a unit of property in particular cases. \[Emphasis added\] 41. In Monier Colourtile (NSWSC), one issue was whether a two-way radio “system” comprising a base station, mobile receiver transmitters and an executive handset was a “unit of eligible property”. 42 The taxpayer argued that the components of the two–way radio system were one unit of property because the components were useless without each other. Lee J said that, while that was true in a commercial sense so far as the user was concerned, the test has regard to the unit and its purpose or function. He concluded that the base station and the mobile stations each had a distinct function and were separate units of property: 43 40 At \[57\]–\[59\]. 41 FCT v Tully Co-operative Sugar Milling Association Ltd 83 ATC 4,495 (FCA) at 4,504. 42 Monier Colourtile Pty Ltd v FCT 83 ATC 4,399 (NSWSC). 43 At 4,406–4,407. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 39 The contention advanced on behalf of the company is that all the components of the system constitute one unit of property — or at the very least those in the initial acquisition in February, viz. the base station and the fourteen mobiles. It is stressed that the base station is useless without one or more mobile stations and vice versa. Whilst it must be acknowledged that this is true in a commercial sense so far as the user is concerned, that forms no basis for a conclusion that the entirety is to be regarded as one unit for the purposes of sec. 82AB. The test laid down in Tully Co-operative Sugar Milling Association Ltd. v. F.C. of T. ... results in the conclusion that the base station, each mobile station and the handset were separate units of property, within the meaning of the section. ... ... The test has regard to the unit and its purpose or function, without regard to the fact that that function may only become commercially useful or valuable to the holder of the property if some other equipment is also put to use according to its particular function. \[Emphasis added\] 42. On appeal, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia found no reason to disturb Lee J’s finding. 44 43. And, in Veterinary Medical, Pincus J said the function identified must be the “external function”, which he described as the practical use to which the unit is able to be put in the taxpayer’s business: 45 The test of function is of no use unless one decides what sort of function is relevant. ..., it appears to me that if the function test is to have any sensible use, the function identified must be, so to speak, the external function — the practical use to which the unit is able to be put in the taxpayer's business. \[Emphasis added\] Functionally complete (to some degree) 44. Functional completeness is about an item’s function and its ability to carry out that function. Functional completeness does not mean the item performs a different function to another item. It is about whether the item can function on its own or is integral to the functioning of a wider asset. 45. IS 10/01, after considering the issue of “completeness” and the decision in Poverty Bay Electric Power, c oncludes: 124. In addition, the court \[in Poverty Bay Electric Power (CA)\] found that a smaller part of the network was not the relevant asset because it was only part of an integrated system incapable of separate operation. This strongly suggests it is relevant that 44 Monier Colourtile Pty Ltd v FCT 84 ATC 4,846 (FCFCA) at 4,850. 45 FCT v Veterinary Medical and Surgical Supplies Ltd 88 ATC 4,642 (FCA) at 4,648. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 39 an asset be able to function by itself (ie, it includes all the parts that are necessary for it to function) and, similarly, that subsidiary parts of an “integrated system” should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right. 46. And, after then considering Auckland Gas (CA), IS 10/01 concludes: 129. It can be seen from this 46 that Blanchard J focuses on the fact that one item (the low pressure system) is dependent on another for its function — that is, it is unable to function separately. This is a “completeness” test — that is, the relevant item includes all the physical things necessary for it to carry out its function and would be incomplete if one of the items necessary for it to function was not included. 47. Functional completeness is also mentioned in IS 12/03 at \[65\] where it refers to “a functional unit in its own right” and in IS0025 under the heading “Summary of the key principles taken from these cases”. 48. However, functional completeness, as described in the earlier guidance set out above, does not necessarily mean the relevant item is self-contained or separately used (eg, it may require power from an external source or be a machine in a manufacturing process). This follows from Australian decisions on a “unit of eligible property”. Fitzgerald J in Tully (FCA) referred to an item that requires power from an external source or a machine that is incorporated into a manufacturing process but capable of separate function. Fitzgerald J said: 47 I see no reason to doubt that there is, for present purposes, a unit of property if it is capable of independent existence, not necessarily self-contained, e.g. it may require power from an external source, not necessarily separately used, e.g. it may be incorporated into an operating system such as a machine or complex of machinery in a manufacturing process, but capable either of separate function, or of function in conjunction with different parts, or in a different context, from its current user. \[Emphasis added\] 49. In Monier Colourtile (NSWSC), Lee J said the test had regard to the unit and its purpose or function without regard to the fact it may become commercially useful or valuable only if some other equipment were also put to use according to its particular function. By way of example, Lee J referred to a television set and transmitter: 48 The test has regard to the unit and its purpose or function, without regard to the fact that that function may only become commercially useful or valuable to the holder of the property if some other equipment is also put to use according to its particular function. Such a state of affairs has always been commonplace, and modern technology increases the instances of interaction of 46 Auckland Gas (CA) per Blanchard J at 15,019 cited in IS 10/01 at \[128\]. 47 At 4,506. 48 At 4,407. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 39 the functions of diverse pieces of property. A television set is still a television set although the television station goes off the air. A transmitter remains a transmitter though there be no receiver. Each can be separately replaced as required and separately paid for. Each can be separately located, remote from each other. \[Emphasis added\] Varying the function of something else 50. An item of property that varies the function of another item of property (eg, it enables the other item to be used for a specialised purpose) will tend to remain a separate item of property. Generally, the two things will not combine to form a larger whole. 51. In Tully (QSC), Thomas J referred to a separate unit of eligible property could arise where the item varied the performance of something else: 49 In my opinion a component may be a unit of property for the purposes of sec. 82AB in the context of a manufacturing system, if it can be shown to perform a discrete function, or if it can be shown to vary the performance of that system. 52. And in Monier Colourtile (NSWSC), Lee J stated: 50 A ”unit” is, as a matter of ordinary English, an entity, an entire thing in itself, and whether property is such can for the purposes of the Act be ascertained by reference to its capacity to perform a definable, identifiable function. The function test, furthermore, readily accommodates the case where any number of single items, each having a specific purpose, are brought together so as to create an item having its own function. A motor car for instance comprises multifarious parts, each having a specific function, but all in combination produce a readily identifiable unit with its own individual function, viz. a means of carriage of persons, a vehicle. Such a case is of course always to be distinguished from the mere attachment together of items of property which themselves have a separate independent function. No new unit of property is then created. ... The test set out in Tully, however, also covers the case where some piece of property on being ”attached” to a unit of property which has its own independent function varies the performance of that unit. In that event, the attachment and the original unit do not constitute a further unit of property but each remain as separate units of property. An illustration of this is to be found in Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd. v. F.C. of T. .... McTiernan J. at ATC p. 4103; C.L.R. p. 13 said: ”Counsel for the Commissioner submitted that a sliver can with piston and spring is a ‘unit of property’ to which the words ‘manufacturing plant’ in subsec. (1) apply. He said that a piston and spring without the can were in the nature of spare parts for the ’unit of property’, and that it was the policy of the section to encourage manufacturers to buy new plant, rather than to 49 Tully Co-operative Sugar Milling Association Limited v FCT 82 ATC 4,454 (QSC) at 4,459. 50 At 4,405. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 39 patch up the old. In my opinion it is not necessary to embark upon this consideration of policy. Sliver cans are used in the spinning factory for other purposes besides use with spring and piston to hold a sliver. For example they are commonly used to hold fibre bobbins on removal from the machine. I therefore regard the can as one unit of property, and the spring and piston as another, as an additional attachment to enable the can to be used for a more specialised purpose. It is true that the spring and piston cannot be used without the can, but the same could be said of any attachment for a tractor such as a mower or post hole digger operated from a power take off.” \[Emphasis added\] 53. Lee J also referred to the Australian Board of Review Case M98 where a tractor was held to be a separate unit of property from two items of equipment used with it (a carry-all and soil ripper). 51 The tractor was held to have its own independent function – as a tractor. The items of equipment had purposes even though they needed the tractor to pull them. Lee J explained that the items of equipment enabled the tractor to be used for a specialised purpose: 52 A similar problem arose in Case M98, 80 ATC 689 dealt with by the Board of Review. There the taxpayer, a grazier, claimed an investment allowance with respect to a tractor and two items of equipment used with it, a carry-all which cost $252 and a soil ripper, which cost $164. The investment allowance was allowed in respect of the tractor but not in respect of the two items of equipment, each being less than $500. The Board treated all three items as separate units. The tractor had its own independent function, as a tractor, and the carry-all and the ripper, in order to carry out their purposes, needed the tractor to pull them. The carry-all and the ripper, it could be said, applying the approach made by McTiernan J. in Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd. v. F.C. of T. ... enabled the tractor to be used for specialised purposes. Indicators the item is not an item of property Degree of physical connection or separateness 54. The indicators discussed in this statement can sometimes be seen as the inverse expression of other indicators. For instance, where a degree of physical connection exists with other items, there is, arguably, a lack of physical distinctness or separateness. On the other hand, a degree of physical connection between things does not necessarily make them a single item for depreciation purposes (such as, where the item varies the function of another item, as discussed from \[50\]). Also, a lack 51 Case M98 80 ATC 689. 52 At 4,405. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 39 of physical connection does not necessarily make different items separate items of property (such as, where they are part of an integrated system, as discussed from \[59\]). 55. However, two Australian decisions, Veterinary Medical and Monier Colourtile (NSWSC), both concerning a “unit of eligible property”, provide an interesting contrast between situations where the absence or presence of physical connection may have been determinative. Veterinary Medical concerned whether a telephone system consisting of a central processing unit and seven physically connected handsets was considered a single unit. Pincus J said that Lee J’s decision in Monier Colourtile ( NSWSC) (where each component of the two-way radio “system” was considered a separate unit) would suggest the telephone system under consideration in the case should also comprise multiple units of property. 56. However, despite this, Pincus J went on to find that the elements of the telephone system constituted one unit of property. Pincus J accepted the earlier finding in the tribunal that “no part of the system could operate without the integrity of the physical connection between the main equipment and the stations being preserved”. 53 57. The fact the elements of the telephone system were physically connected appears to have been a factor in Pincus J’s decision. Pincus J said: 54 The result of the radio system aspect of the Monier Colourtile case is at first sight consistent with the view that such a collection of items as is here in question constitutes as many units as there are items. However, in Tully Co-operative Sugar Milling Association Limited v. F.C. of T. 82 ATC 4454 a conclusion was come to which some may find hard to reconcile with that in the later case. There the “mixed juice pumping station” dealt with by Thomas J. at p. 4457 et seq. consisted of a number of items, ... ... The degree and permanence of physical connection differ in the cases I have mentioned: presumably it would be easier to disconnect the handsets in issue in this case than to take out the motors in the Tully case; in Monier Colourtile, the various elements were not physically connected at all. That factor appears, in the passages I have quoted above, to have weighed heavily with Lee J., but not necessarily with the Full Court. ... ... I doubt if one can satisfactorily explain the difference between the outcome of the Tully case, in so far as it related to the mixed juice pumping station, and the outcome of the Monier Colourtile case in so far as it related to the radio communication system, other than by reference to the lack of physical connection in the latter case. ... 53 Case U132 87 ATC 771 at 773. 54 At 4,648. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 39 ... it appears to me that where a system consisting of diverse elements is bought as a system intended to function as a whole and each element interacts with at least one other, one should find unity in the function of the whole system, at least where the elements are physically connected. \[Emphasis added\] 58. The degree of physical connection between items is also discussed in IS 10/01 55 and in IS 12/03. 56 Is part of an integrated system 59. A thing that combines with other things to create a larger whole with a unified function will generally be regarded as not having a separate function. The thing will not be functionally distinct. 60. As mentioned in IS 12/03 ( see \[33\]), “subsidiary parts of an integrated system should be considered part of that system rather than assets in their own right”. IS 10/01 also refers to this indicator. 57 The view is supported by the decisions in Poverty Bay Electric Power Board, Hawkes Bay Power and Auckland Gas (CA). 61. In Veterinary Medical, Pincus J concluded that, in addition to being physically connected, the elements of the telephone system constituted one unit of property because they were part of a system intended to function as a whole: 58 It is preferable to apply the function test here by denying that an individual handset has a separate function for present purposes, and affirming that each element should be treated as part of a system intended to function as a whole. A handset can do nothing by itself. Entirely separate questions arise where (as in the first branch of the Monier Colourtile case) one is dealing with elements which are not permanent parts of the system, or dealing with later additions to an initial installation. Leaving those special cases aside, it appears to me that where a system consisting of diverse elements is bought as a system intended to function as a whole and each element interacts with at least one other, one should find unity in the function of the whole system, at least where the elements are physically connected. \[Emphasis added\] 62. In Tully (FCA) Lockhart J said there may not be a unit until a number of parts have been integrated into a complete system (see \[40\]). 55 At \[131\] and \[134\] and step 3 of the three-step test set out in that statement. 56 At \[59\]and \[85\] – \[86\] (in relation to Case N8 where items were separate items when the only physical connection between them was electrical wiring) and in the summary at \[97\]. 57 See also at \[122\] – \[124\] \[140\] – \[141\] and \[152\]. 58 At 4,648. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 20 of 39 63. In Monier Colourtile (NSWSC), Lee J said that the “function test” readily accommodated a case where several single items, each having a specific purpose, were brought together to create an item having its own function. By way of example, Lee J referred to the parts of a motor car, each having a specific function, but all in combination producing a readily identifiable unit with its own individual function (see \[52\]). 64. The fact elements of a system are interchangeable or can be used elsewhere does not stop the whole system being treated as an item of property. In Veterinary Medical, Pincus J said as long as the elements interacted with each other, it did not matter that they were interchangeable: 59 There was debate before me about the interchangeability of elements and the possibility of using some elements elsewhere than in the system in question. Handsets could be taken away, or additional handsets could be incorporated into the system. ... It does not appear to me, however, that it is consistent with the result arrived at in the Tully case to hold that the existence of these possibilities precludes the whole system's being treated as one unit. As long as the elements interact with one another, I do not think it matters whether their interaction is immutable; ... 65. Whether an integrated system exists and the extent to which various items are included in it is a question of fact and degree to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Any single item of property may be made up of interdependent parts, but there is “a danger of distortion if too large or too small a subject matter is identified” as the relevant item of property. 60 66. Where several items are acquired at the same time this may be indicative of the existence of an integrated system (whether or not they are acquired as part of the same transaction or from the same supplier). However, timing alone is not determinative as items acquired at different times may still be part of an integrated system. Conversely, items may be acquired at the same time but not constitute an integrated system. Is a necessary part of completing some other item 67. Incompleteness or its converse, completeness, covers a variety of differently expressed factors that cross-over with other indicators discussed above. In IS 10/01 they are discussed as follows: 140. Completeness involves a consideration of whether the item is: 59 At 4,648. 60 Poverty Bay Electric Power Board at 15,006. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 39 • an integral part of the asset (Auckland Trotting, Hawkes Bay Power); • a subsidiary part of something else or can be independently installed without recourse to other items (Lindsay, Hawkes Bay Power); • necessary for the asset to function (Lindsay, Hawkes Bay Power, Auckland Gas (CA)); • capable of separate operation or whether it is part of an integrated system (Poverty Bay, Auckland Gas (CA)); • clearly distinguishable (Poverty Bay). 141. It is considered that all of these factors are directed to a similar enquiry. For example, whether an item is an integral part of an asset, is the same question as whether the item is necessary for the asset to function. Whether the item is a subsidiary part of something else is asking the question another way — that is, if it is a whole standalone asset that can function by itself, it is less likely to be a subsidiary part of something else. However, where an item is an integral part of the asset in question, then it will be a subsidiary part of that asset. Similarly, whether the item is capable of separate operation or whether it is part of an integrated system is making the same enquiry. 142. Consequently, it is considered that all of the above factors can be combined into one enquiry along the lines of: is the item in question part of a larger asset that would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item in question? In this regard, if the item is complete and capable of separate operation on its own this will point towards the smaller item not being a necessary part of a larger item. \[Emphasis added\] 68. In Tully, completeness was referred in the following terms: 61 It is not necessary that \[a unit of eligible property is\] functionally operative though in many circumstances this may be called for. For example, if five parts are installed in an assembly line and all that is needed to render the line operative is a sixth part, but until that part is installed no part may function or operate, the functional incompleteness does not necessarily deprive each of the five units of its character as “a unit of eligible property” for the purposes of the Assessment Act. It depends on the facts of the case. Yet, at other times a ”unit” may not come into being until all the components have been assembled. For example, a farm fence is made up of a number of posts and rails or wires. It is difficult to conceive of any "unit'' coming into being until the fence is erected. \[Emphasis added\] 61 At 4,504. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 22 of 39 69. In Monier Colourtile, the Full Federal Court of Australia cited the passage from Tully shown above, and concluded: 62 The trial Judge found as a fact that each of the mobile stations was functionally complete in itself and each had a separate independent existence. He noted that it was stressed by the taxpayer that the base station was useless without one or more mobile stations and vice versa. Whilst he acknowledged that this was true in a commercial sense as far as the user was concerned, he regarded this circumstance as no basis for a conclusion that the entirety was to be regarded as one unit for the purposes of sec. 82AB. In his view each was capable of independent operation although such operation was not the operation for which the taxpayer acquired the property. In our opinion there is no reason to disturb this finding of the trial Judge. \[Emphasis added\] 70. Functional completeness is also referred to in IS 22/04 in relation to the characteristics of a “building”. 63 Summary of the indicators 71. An indicator that the item under consideration is an item of property includes where the item is physically and functionally distinct from a wider asset of which the item might be a part. This requires considering whether the item can be separately identified by physical factors (eg, location or size). It also requires determining the item’s function (ie, the practical use to which it is put) and considering whether this is integral to the physical functioning of a wider asset of which the item may be part. 72. Other indicators that the item under consideration is an item of property include whether the item is (to some degree) functionally complete or where the item varies the function of something else. Functional completeness is about whether the item can function on its own, although this does not necessarily mean the item needs to be self-contained or used separately. 73. Where the item under consideration varies the function of another item it will tend to remain a separate item and the two things are not considered to be combined to form a larger item of property. For example, two items will tend to remain separate items where one item varies the function of another item, enabling it to perform a more specialised function such as a mechanised rear blade attachment for a tractor. 62 At 4,849. 63 At \[32\]. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 39 74. Indicators suggesting the item under consideration is not an item of property are where the item has a physical connection with other items, is part of an integrated system or is a necessary part to complete something else. 75. Where a degree of physical connection exists between the item under consideration and other items, this may indicate the item is not a separate item of property. This may indicate the item is not physically distinct from a wider item. 76. However, a lack of physical connection does not necessarily mean the item is a separate item of property where the item is part of an integrated system designed to function as a whole. In that case, the item may lack functional distinctiveness. 77. An item under consideration will tend not to be a separate item of property if it is a necessary part to complete some other item. This relates to the concept of completeness and whether the other item would be considered incomplete or unable to function without the item under consideration. 78. Determining the item of property in each case requires considering all the circumstances and weighing up the various indicators. It is always a question of fact and degree. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 39 Examples | Tauira The following seven examples illustrate how the indicators discussed above help to identify the relevant item of property for depreciation purposes. Example | Tauira 1: Utility vehicle and trailer Tow and Mow Services Ltd recently acquired a second-hand utility vehicle and a trailer for its garden maintenance business. Tow and Mow acquired the vehicle and trailer from the same vendor at the same time. It wants to know whether the trailer is a separate item of property or part of the vehicle for depreciation purposes. The vehicle and trailer are separate items of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The trailer has a separate function from the vehicle. The function of the vehicle is primarily to transport people, whereas the trailer transports things.  The trailer functions to transport things as a supplement to the vehicle where those things could not be suitably transported by the vehicle (eg, large items of equipment, large volumes of raw materials or garden waste). Accordingly, the trailer varies the function of the vehicle, which suggests they are separate items of property despite having, at times, a degree of physical connection.  The vehicle is functionally complete – it can function without the trailer (ie, the trailer is not required to complete the vehicle). While the trailer cannot transport things unless towed by a vehicle, the trailer is functionally complete in that it includes all that is necessary to fulfil the particular notion of a “trailer”. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 39  Both the vehicle and the trailer are physically distinct and can be located separately.  The vehicle and trailer are not parts of an integrated system (either together or together with other items) such as to suggest they are not separate items of property. While a limited degree of physical connection exists between the vehicle and the trailer, this arises only when the trailer is in use, and they are easily separated without damage to either. This physical connection on its own is not sufficient to prevent the vehicle and the trailer each being considered an entirety and a separate item of property. Example | Tauira 2: Vehicle GPS unit Jim Fargo owns a courier delivery business. He recently bought a larger vehicle to accommodate increased demand for his services. The vehicle did not come with a factory-fitted global positioning system (GPS), so Jim bought a portable GPS unit. The GPS unit has the option of being plugged into the vehicle’s power supply and can be easily mounted on the dashboard. Jim wants to know whether the GPS unit is a separate item of property or whether it is part of the vehicle. The delivery vehicle and GPS unit are separate items of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The GPS unit has a separate function from the delivery vehicle. The function of the delivery vehicle is to transport people and things whereas the GPS unit provides information to assist with navigation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 26 of 39  The GPS varies the function of the vehicle. It enables the vehicle to be used more efficiently for a specialised purpose of delivering goods.  The functional aspects of the items suggest they are separate items of property despite having a degree of physical connection.  The delivery vehicle is functionally complete – it can function without the GPS unit (ie, the GPS unit is not required to complete the delivery vehicle).  Although the GPS unit is unable to function without being wired into the vehicle’s power supply, this alone does not deprive it of its status as a separate item of property for depreciation purposes. It is functionally complete in that it includes all that is necessary to fulfil the particular notion of a “GPS unit”.  The delivery vehicle and GPS unit are not parts of an integrated system (either together or together with other items) such as to suggest they are not separate items of property. The delivery vehicle and GPS unit do have a reasonable degree of physical connection, which could suggest they should be treated as a single item. However, the manner of their physical connection is such that they can be physically separated at any time without damage to either item. This factor alone is not determinative, and all other factors must be considered as a whole. On balance, the vehicle and the GPS unit can each be considered an entirety, and each is a separate item of property. The conclusion in this example might be different if Jim purchased a GPS unit that needed to be installed into the vehicle for it to function. That is, the GPS unit needed to be hardwired into the vehicle’s power supply and permanently affixed into the vehicle’s dashboard. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 27 of 39 Example | Tauira 3: Desktop computer package DeskJobs Ltd buys a desktop computer package consisting of a computer (which integrates a monitor, processor and data-storage unit into a single unit) plus a wireless keyboard and mouse. DeskJobs wants to know whether the computer, keyboard and mouse are separate items of property for depreciation purposes or components of a single item. The computer, keyboard, and mouse are one item of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The function of the desktop computer package is the processing, storing and display of digital content created or accessed or both using the computer, keyboard and mouse together. The desktop computer package is unable to perform its function without the computer, keyboard, and mouse. While this functional completeness might be less evident if the computer had a touchscreen, in many practical applications (including in this example) the touchscreen has not entirely replaced the need for the additional functionality of a keyboard or a mouse or both. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 39  While each part (the computer, keyboard and mouse) performs a function of its own, these functions are not independent functions but are integral or subsidiary functions in terms of the practical use to which the desktop computer is put (ie, the package’s function).  The computer, keyboard or mouse has no practical purpose or use without the other components.  While the computer, keyboard and mouse are physically distinct, they are components intended to function together as a single integrated system.  The fact the computer, keyboard and mouse may each be interchangeable in that they could be used with other compatible items does not prevent them being part of a single item for depreciation purposes. On these facts, the computer, keyboard and mouse cannot be considered entireties by themselves and separate items of property. Together, they comprise a single item of property. The cost of any subsequent additions to the computer package (eg, an ergomomic mouse or another screen) are treated as an addition to the cost of the package, rather than as the cost of a separate item of property. However, if DeskJobs Ltd purchased a wireless-capable multifunctional printer at the same time as the desktop computer package, the printer could be a separate item of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The desktop computer package can function without the printer.  The printer has a separate function of printing, copying and scanning documents. It supplements or varies the function of the desktop computer package.  The functional aspects of the items suggest the printer is a separate item of property.  Although the printer is unable to perform its printing function without the desktop computer package, this does not deprive it of its status as a separate item of property for depreciation purposes. It is functionally complete in that it includes all that is necessary to fulfil the particular notion of a “printer”.  The printer is also physically distinct from the desktop computer package. While, because of wireless capabilities, the printer is not unique in this, the same could be said of the components of the desktop computer package. However, the printer is not an essential part of the desktop computer package system in the same way as, say, the wireless mouse. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 39 If the printer has a cost of not more than the threshold set in s EE 38 (currently $1,000) it may be able to be depreciated at the rate of 100%, provided the other requirements of that section are met. Example | Tauira 4: Network computer system Furniture Ltd is a nationwide chain of furniture retail stores. It acquires and sets up a new computer system with a central data processing and storage server and a network of remote “thin client” terminals located in its stores throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. The central server receives, processes and displays sales and other data sent to it over the network from the remote terminals. The terminals are simple low performance computers that are designed for remote connection with a server with limited capacity for operating independently of the server. Furniture Ltd wants to know whether each remote terminal is a separate item of property for depreciation purposes or part of a single item of property being the network computer system. The central server and the remote terminals are a single item of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The function of the central server is to receive, process and display data received from the remote terminals. The central server cannot function without the remote terminals. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 39  The terminals serve no practical purpose or use without the central server. That is, the terminals are not functionally distinct from each other or the central server.  While the terminals and central server perform a function of their own, these functions are not independent functions but are integral or subsidiary functions in terms of the practical purpose to which the computer network is put. The central server and remote terminals are integrated into a system that is intended to function together.  The fact each terminal and the central server may be interchangeable in that they could be used with other compatible items does not prevent them being part of a single item for depreciation purposes. The terminals and the central server cannot be considered entireties by themselves and separate items of property. Together, they comprise a single item of property. The conclusion in this example might be different if the terminals were more capable of independent operation from the central server (ie, “thick client” terminals). Example | Tauira 5: Marine fender system Port Operator Ltd installed a fender system on a wharf generally used by container ships at the coastal port it operates. The fender system provides a buffer between the wharf and ships to prevent damage to the wharf and ships. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 39 Port Operator installed the fender system because the port needs to cope with larger container ships. The wharf comprises steel piles, concrete beams and a concrete deck. The fender system comprises 29 assemblies spaced along the wharf, generally 5 metres apart. The number and spacing of the assemblies have been determined to ensure the fender system withstands and absorbs the energy generated by large ships. All 29 assemblies are required for the fender system to function. Each assembly comprises:  a large conical rubber fender;  a low-frictional panel that contacts the ship’s hull; and  steel framing and galvanised chains to support the rubber fender and low- frictional panel. Each assembly is fixed to the wharf with stainless steel bolts. The fender system is designed for large container or cargo ships. It may not be suitable for differently configured vessels, which are usually required to provide their own fenders. Port Operator wants to know whether the fender system is a separate item of property from the wharf for depreciation purposes. Both wharves and marine fender systems can be depreciable property, but the latter attracts a higher depreciation rate. The fender system is a separate item of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The fender system and wharf are physically distinct from each other in terms of relative size and ease of relocation (ie, the fender system is capable of being relocated to another wharf).  The fender system has a separate function from that of the wharf. The function of the fender system is to provide a buffer between large container ships and the wharf. The function of the wharf is to provide a stable and level mooring for all vessels to facilitate the loading and unloading of cargo.  The wharf is functionally complete – it can still function as a wharf without the fender system. While the fender system cannot function without the wharf it is functionally complete in that it includes all that is necessary to fulfil the particular notion of a “fender system”. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 39  The separate functions and completeness of the wharf and the fender system suggest they are separate items of property.  The fender system varies the performance of the wharf. It enables it to be used for a specialised purpose, namely the loading and unloading of container ships. This also suggests they are separate items of property. A high degree of physical attachment exists between the fenders and wharf. However, having regard to all other relevant facts and circumstances, this does not, of itself, make them one item of property for depreciation purposes. The fender system and wharf can each be considered an entirety, and each is a separate item of property. Note that each of the 29 assemblies comprising the fender system is designed to work as part of an integrated system and does not have a discrete function when considered in isolation. Therefore, each assembly is not considered to be a separate item of property. Example | Tauira 6: Drone used in aerial photography business Photo Ltd recently acquired a remote-control drone for use in its aerial photography business. The drone has a built-in camera that cannot be purchased separately from the drone. Photo Ltd wants to know whether the camera is a separate item of property for depreciation purposes or part of the drone. It also wants to know whether the drone’s IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 39 remote-control handset is a separate item of property for depreciation purposes or part of the drone. On these facts, the built-in camera, drone, and remote-control handset are one item of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  Neither the built-in camera nor the handset has a practical purpose or use without the drone.  The camera is unable to function separately from the drone and handset.  Physically separating the camera from the drone is not possible without damage to both.  The drone cannot function without the handset.  The drone with the built–in camera and the handset is an integrated system with the drone, camera and handset all intended to function together. The lack of physical distinctness in this situation is particularly suggestive of the drone and the camera being (or being part of, with the handset) a single item of property. If the drone had no built-in camera and had an action camera attached to it instead, the drone and the action camera would be separate items of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The drone has a separate function from that of the camera and each is able to fulfil that function without the other. The drone functions as a remotely controlled aircraft. The action camera functions as a photographic device.  The action camera would vary the performance of the drone. It would enable it to be used for a specialised purpose of taking aerial photographs or videos.  The drone and the camera are each functionally complete and each separately fulfils the notion of a “drone” and “camera”. While a limited degree of physical connection exists between the drone and the camera this arises only when the drone is in use for aerial photography purposes. They are easily separated without damage to either. This physical connection on its own is not sufficient to prevent the drone and camera each being considered an entirety and each a separate item of property. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 39 Example | Tauira 7: Solid-fill puncture-proof tyres Contractor Ltd replaced the tyres on its front–end loader with solid-fill puncture-proof tyres. These are tyres that have been injected with a liquid that cures to form a soft rubber core. This eliminates flat tyres and blowouts, and the tyre pressure remains constant for the life of the tyres. Contractor wants to know whether the solid-fill tyres are separate items of property from the front-end loader for depreciation purposes. The solid fill tyres and the front-end loader are not separate items of property for depreciation purposes for the following reasons:  The function of the front-end loader is that of a specialised wheeled vehicle for picking up and moving large quantities of materials, such as earth or sand. The tyres do not perform a different function, and do not vary the function of the loader.  The front-end loader is unable to function without the tyres, whether treated with solid fill or not. The tyres do not have any practical purpose or use on their own.  The tyres perform a function that is an integral or subsidiary part of the loader’s function.  The lack of a functional distinction between the loader and the tyres suggests they are not separate items of property. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 35 of 39 The tyres are firmly attached to the wheels and the wheels and loader are physically connected and are part of an integrated system of connected components intended to function together. The lack of a physical distinction between the loader and the tyres also suggests they are not separate items of property. The front-end loader and the solid-fill tyres cannot be considered as entireties and separate items of property. Together, they comprise a single item of property. The tyres’ superior performance over the conventional tyres replaced indicate the tyres are a capital improvement to the front-end loader.

1 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED BINDING RULINGS PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 18/07: INCOME TAX AND GOODS AND SERVICES TAX – WRITING OFF DEBTS AS BAD This is an update and reissue of BR Pub 05/01. For more information about earlier publications of this Public Ruling see the Commentary to this Ruling. This is a public ruling made under s 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation laws All legislative references to the ITA are to the Income Tax Act 2007 and all references to the GST Act are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s DB 31(1)(a) of the ITA and s 26(1) of the GST Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the writing-off of a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt, for income tax and/or GST purposes, in the following circumstances:  An existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and  the debt has been adjudged as “bad” by a reasonably prudent commercial person who has concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by anyone else (either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise); and  the bad debt has been “written off” (in the income year or GST taxable period for which a deduction is claimed), in accordance with the accounting and record- keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer, in one of the following ways: o in the case of a taxpayer who maintains a computer-based accounting software system, an authorised person has made the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; or o in the case of a company taxpayer (other than one set out above), an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, has made the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the company’s account books recording the debt as written off; or o in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) who maintains double-entry accounts, an authorised person has made the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the business’s account books recording the debt as written off; or 2 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED o in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small, unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, the taxpayer has made a note in their bookkeeping records setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, stating that the debt has been written off, and recording the date of the writing off. For the avoidance of doubt, the Arrangement does not include arrangements where subpart BG of the ITA and/or s 76 of the GST Act applies to void the arrangement. How the taxation laws apply to the Arrangement The taxation laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The requirements of s DB 31(1)(a)(i) of the ITA will be satisfied and a deduction will be permitted for the amount of the bad debt that has been written off, provided that all the other requirements of s DB 31 are met.  The requirements of s 26(1)(c) of the GST Act will be satisfied and a deduction will be permitted for the amount of the bad debt that has been written off, provided that all the other requirements of s 26 are met. The period or tax year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for an indefinite period beginning on 1 September 2018. This Ruling is signed by me on 29 August 2018.

The commentary is intended to help readers understand and apply the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 18/07 (the Ruling). Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise stated. Relevant legislative provisions are reproduced in the Appendix to this commentary. Contents Summary ............................................................................................................................... 3 Application of the legislation ...................................................................................................... 3 References ............................................................................................................................ 16 Expired rulings ........................................................................................................... 16 Subject references ...................................................................................................... 16 Legislative references .................................................................................................. 16 Case references .......................................................................................................... 16 Appendix – Legislation ............................................................................................................ 17 Summary 1. The ITA and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons a deduction for bad debts if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirements that the debt must be both bad and written off. There are other circumstances when a bad debt deduction can be claimed and other requirements that must be satisfied before a bad debt deduction will be allowed. This Ruling only considers the questions of when a debt becomes “bad” and when the bad debt will have been “written off”. It does not consider any of the other legislative requirements relating to deductibility of bad debts such as the application of the capital limitation. 2. These issues were previously the subject of Public Ruling BR Pub 05/01. BR Pub 05/01 is replaced by this Ruling from 1 September 2018. BR Pub 05/01 concluded that a debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assuming that other legislative requirements in the ITA and GST Act were also satisfied). This Ruling updates the earlier ruling but does not change the Commissioner’s position. Application of the legislation 3. Section DB 31(1)(a) of the ITA provides: DB 31 Bad debts No deduction (with exception) (1) A person is denied a deduction in an income year for a bad debt, except to the extent to which— (a) the debt is a debt— (i) written off as bad in the income year: (ii) for which the debtor is released from making all remaining payments under the Insolvency Act 2006 4 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED excluding Part 5, subparts 1 and 2 of that Act, or under the Companies Act 1993, or under the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand, and the person is required to calculate a base price adjustment by section EW 29 (When calculation of base price adjustment required) for the debt for the income year: (iii) for which the debtor is a company that is released from making all remaining payments by a deed or agreement of composition, and the person is required to calculate a base price adjustment by section EW 29 for the debt for the income year; and ... 4. Section 26(1) of the GST Act provides: 26 Bad debts (1) Where a registered person— (a) has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b) has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c) has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,— that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: provided that where goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement, the registered person shall only make a deduction under section 20(3) of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time that the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement: 5. Each of s DB 31 of the ITA and s 26 of the GST Act requires that:  there must be a “bad debt”; and  the bad debt must have been “written off” (unless one of the circumstances described in s DB 31(1)(a)(ii) or (iii) of the ITA applies). 6. This commentary will discuss firstly the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad”, and secondly what actions are sufficient to “write off” a bad debt. As stated above, we are not considering any of the other legislative requirements relating to deductibility of bad debts. The tests for whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing off” of a bad debt, apply whether the debt is subject to the financial arrangements rules or not. First requirement – debt must be “bad” 7. Whether a debt is bad depends on an objective, factual consideration of all the relevant circumstances of each case. When determining whether a debt is bad, the relevant time of inquiry is the time when the decision is made to write off the debt (Case 45/93 93 ATC 486, 27 ATR 1022). 8. A debt must be bad before it can be written off for the purposes of s DB 31 of the ITA and s 26 of the GST Act. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood 5 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by anyone else (either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise). The term “commercial person” refers to people who are concerned with or engaged in commerce or business and would include people who have professional knowledge of commerce such as directors of a company, a loans manager of a bank, accountants, a business consultant, and lawyers with business experience. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer. The standard to which the test must be proved is on the balance of probabilities: see Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (Budget Rent-A-Car) (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, at page 12,269; Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541, at page 3,548; Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, at page 12,111; Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, at page 8,194; Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014 at page 11,029. 9. To determine whether a debt is bad, there must be sufficient information to enable a reasonably prudent commercial person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. This requires a bona fide assessment based on sound commercial considerations that the debt is bad. Payment of the debt must be more than merely doubtful. For example, a debt will not be accepted as bad merely because a certain set period of time for payment (eg, 90 days or 180 days) has elapsed with no payment or contact having been made by the debtor. A debt is not bad if there is still a real and continuing dispute about payment of the debt (Case 45/93). However, a debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (Case N69). Factors to consider whether a debt is bad 10. Determining whether a debt is bad is a question of fact and will depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. However, the following factors may be relevant when considering whether a debt is bad (although no one factor is decisive):  The length of time a debt is outstanding – the longer a debt is outstanding the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider the debt to be bad. This will of necessity vary depending on the amount of debt outstanding and the taxpayer’s credit arrangements (eg, 90, 120 or 150 days overdue). However, a debt will not be considered bad merely because a set period of time for payment has elapsed with no payment or contact having been made by the debtor. Similarly, a debt may have only been outstanding for a short period and still be regarded as bad where other evidence exists that the debt will not be collected.  The efforts that a creditor has taken to collect a debt – the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider the debt to be bad.  Other information obtained by a creditor – a creditor may have obtained particular information about a debtor, for example through business or personal networks, of the kind that would lead a reasonably prudent commercial person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors.  The debtor has died leaving no, or insufficient, assets out of which the debt may be satisfied. 6 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED  The debtor cannot be traced – the creditor has been unable to ascertain the existence of, or whereabouts of, any assets against which action could be taken.  Where the debt has become statute barred and the debtor is relying on this defence (or it is reasonable to assume that the debtor will do so) for non- payment.  If the debtor is a company in liquidation or receivership reports from the liquidator or receiver indicate there are insufficient funds to pay the whole debt, or the part claimed as a bad debt. Taxpayer’s information about the debt 11. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In those circumstances a taxpayer’s considered opinion will suffice so long as the view they have reached is the view that a reasonably prudent commercial person would reach. 12. However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in treating a debt as bad. Writing off a debt as bad may entitle a taxpayer to:  a deduction in calculating income for income tax purposes, worth up to 33% of the debt, depending on the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate; and/or  a GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. 13. Therefore, in the course of tax audits or other enquiries, the Commissioner may inquire into the taxpayer’s decision to treat a debt as bad. In a dispute, it is up to the taxpayer to prove that, on the balance of probabilities, the debt was bad. Therefore, it is recommended that taxpayers document and retain relevant evidence to show that the decision to treat the debt as bad was a reasonable commercial decision. Documentation may include noting down the relevant information that gave rise to the decision that the debt was bad, and copies of any correspondence kept relating to the debt. 14. The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. If the sum involved is small, a reasonably prudent commercial person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. However, the test is always whether the taxpayer has sufficient information to conclude, as any reasonably prudent commercial person would, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid, even if further or any recovery actions were to be taken. Recovery steps taken 15. In most cases, before claiming a deduction for a bad debt, a creditor will have taken legal steps to recover the debt. It is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion that a debt is bad. However, recovery action does not need to be taken before deciding that a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonably prudent commercial person would consider that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. 16. To establish that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid, a reasonably prudent commercial person would, in most situations, take steps to 7 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED recover the debt instead of simply writing it off. This may include a range of actions including legal proceedings. The appropriate steps undertaken will vary according to the size of the debt and the resources available to the creditor to pursue the debt. A creditor might not take any steps to recover the debt where the information suggests there is no hope of payment. 17. The steps taken to recover the debt would generally include one or more of the following:  issuing reminder notices;  attempting to make contact by telephone, mail, or email;  allowing a reasonable period of time to elapse since the original due date for payment of the debt – this will vary depending on the amount of the debt outstanding and the taxpayer’s credit arrangements;  serving a formal demand notice;  commencing legal proceedings for debt recovery;  judgment being entered against the debtor;  executing proceedings to enforce judgment;  ceasing calculation and charging of interest and closing the account (a tracing file may be kept open, also, in the case of a partial write-off, the account may remain open);  valuation of any security held against the debt;  sale of any seized or repossessed assets. 18. While the above factors are indicative of the circumstances in which a debt may be considered bad, ultimately the question is one of fact and will depend on all the circumstances surrounding the transactions. 19. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of some part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take no or only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed will depend on the circumstances. 20. Conversely recovery action may be taken even when the creditor believes there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be recovered and has formed a reasonable view that the debt is bad. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy of pursuing all debtors to discourage other customers from defaulting. Accounting provision for doubtful debts 21. Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to make some accounting provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. 8 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED 22. However, for tax purposes, bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). For accounting purposes, the provision for doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become bad debts in the future. The ITA and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts that are partially bad 23. In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there may be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this instance, it is only that part of the debt that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering that the creditor is entitled to write off as bad and (if all other relevant requirements are satisfied) to claim as a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Bad debts recovered 24. Under s CG 3 of the ITA, when a person receives an amount on account of a bad debt for which a deduction for income tax has previously been allowed, they must include the amount as income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received. 25. Under s 26(2) of the GST Act, when a person recovers an amount on account of a bad debt (whether it is for the whole or part of the debt) in respect of which a deduction from output tax has previously been allowed, that portion of the amount of the deduction previously allowed, as the amount that the bad debt recovered bears to the bad debt written off, shall be deemed to be the GST charged in relation to a taxable supply made during the taxable period in which the bad debt is wholly or partially recovered. Examples of when a debt is bad 26. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that mail addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Forwarding Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit controller for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the company. The credit controller has estimated the likelihood of default for C to be 5%, and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage of it) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Example 3 9 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED A local dairy has supplied $64 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the dairy has heard that someone else is living in the house Mrs D used to rent. The $64 is still owing. Given the relatively small amount owing and the information known to the dairy, it is reasonable for the dairy to make no further enquiries. On the basis of the dairy’s information, it can be assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad debt. However, if the sum involved was somewhat larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to make further enquiries . Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. The solicitor has sent out a number of reminder bills because the bill is four months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a meeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meeting. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,000 of the total debt is bad. He is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad in the income year in which he received the formal notice, and to claim a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Example 6 The same facts exist as in Example 5, but at a later date Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above in Example 5. Also, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 50 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: • include it as gross income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provisional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and • account for GST on the amount recovered in the same proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. 10 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED Second requirement – debt must be “written off” 27. Subject to all other relevant legislative requirements being satisfied, both the ITA and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons a deduction for a bad debt that has been written off. It is not sufficient that a debt is bad – the bad debt must also have been actually written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because the time this occurs establishes the relevant income year or GST taxable period in which a deduction becomes available. Judge Barber stated in Case Z21 (2010) 24 NZTC 14,286 that: Three elements must be satisfied: the debt is bad; a decision has been made to write off the bad debt; and the appropriate bookkeeping entries have been made to record that the bad debt has been written off. ... The purpose of the requirement, that bookkeeping records show the debt to actually be written off, is to provide certainty as to the very point of \[time\] when the write-off actually occurred. 28. Note that there is no requirement that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Tompkins J stated in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car: A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b)\[s DB 31(1)(a)(i)\] is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... 29. Judge Barber discussed the requirement to write off bad debts in the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) decision Case N69 and stated: I consider it that it is elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of s 106(1)(b) \[s DB 31(1)(a)(i)\], book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desirably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporation or business to merely make the appropriate book entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. 30. In Case T48 (1998) 18 NCTC 8,325 the TRA held that for a private individual trader, as distinct from an incorporated company, words on ledger cards such as “written off” with the relevant date are sufficient to indicate that the debt had been actually written off as a bad debt. The taxpayers did not have to meet any other bookkeeping requirements. Judge Barber stated: In Case N69 I contemplated that the businessperson concerned ... would decide that a debt was bad in good faith and in terms of his (or her) business knowledge, and 11 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED make an authorised journal entry in his books of account. He could simply record his decision somewhere in the records of the business. In the case of a company one might expect a resolution of the directors confirming a decision or report of management to write off a debt as bad; although, as I said in Case N69 the executive personnel would normally have the authority to write off bad debts. As already indicated, the notation on the ledger cards written at some stage by T is less than I had contemplated in Case N69, but in the circumstances of this case is adequate to show an actual writing off. As Judge Willy said in Case P53 \[(1992) 14 NZTC 4,370\], there is no one formula for the mechanics of writing off a debt, but the taxpayer \[must\] satisfy the Court, on the balance of probabilities, that the debt has, in fact, been written off in whatever books of account or accounting procedures are kept by the taxpayer. 31. Therefore, to meet the legislative requirements in s DB 31(1)(a)(i) of the ITA and s 26(1)(c) of the GST Act, rather than just making a decision that the debt is bad, taxpayers must be able to show clearly that the debt has actually been written off. To show that this is the case, there must be something written down in the business’s account books stating that the debt is written off. 32. Case law indicates that the minimum written requirements necessary to satisfy the “written off as bad” test may vary for different classes of taxpayer based on the differing nature and level of sophistication of the taxpayer’s accounting records. However, no matter what form a taxpayer’s account books or accounting records may take, those existing for a debt owed by a bad debtor must record that the taxpayer, or an authorised person on behalf of the taxpayer, having decided the debt is bad, has written off the debt accordingly. Writing off the bad debt is what converts it into a potentially deductible debt (depending on whether the other legislative requirements relating to deductibility of bad debts, such as the capital limitation are met). 33. What will be sufficient to meet the “written off” test for various classes of taxpayer are set out below. The classes and the written requirements are based largely on Case N69, Case T48 and the earlier Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,370. The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer when:  in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, an authorised person makes the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; or  in the case of a company (other than one set out as above ), an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, makes the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the company’s account books recording the debt as written off; or  in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) who maintains double-entry accounts, an authorised person makes the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the business’s account books recording the debt as written off; or  in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, the taxpayer makes a note in their bookkeeping records setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, stating that the debt has been written off, and recording the date of the writing off. 34. There may be very exceptional cases where something less than the writing-off requirements set out above are acceptable. In Case S73 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,454, the taxpayer was unable to access their accounting records and a letter was sent to the Commissioner stating that the debt had been written off. The TRA stated 12 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED that it was a question of fact whether a particular debt had been written off and was satisfied on the evidence before it that it clearly had been. Nevertheless, there remains a written requirement in all cases. 35. Further details of the specific form the write-off of a bad debt may take in the creditor taxpayer’s books are outlined in the next section of this commentary. 36. The time a debt is written off determines when a deduction can be claimed. Therefore, the necessary writing-off must take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period when the bad debt deduction is claimed. Writing off a bad debt cannot be backdated. If there are numerous debts, it is important to allow sufficient time to review them and complete all necessary “writing-off” accounting entries before the end of an income year or GST taxable period, to enable any bad debt deductions to be claimed in that year or GST taxable period. 37. In all cases, business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of s 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s 75 of the GST Act. Accounts kept by taxpayers 38. Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double-entry accounts are based. If debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing-off will be clearly shown by appropriate bookkeeping entries in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. Generally, this means the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. No matter what processes are followed when preparing a taxpayer’s double-entry accounts, having made the decision that the debt is bad (in accordance with the tests already outlined), it is essential to make the appropriate authorised entry/entries writing off the debt before claiming a deduction. 39. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtors ledger, the taxpayer must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that whatever the form of records used, those showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must clearly record that the creditor, having made the decision that the debt is bad (in accordance with the tests already outlined), has written the debt off accordingly. 40. Particular examples of bad debts accepted by the Commissioner as having been written off include the following:  If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued, placing the invoice in a “bad debts” file and indicating by way of a dated written note on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad, is sufficient.  If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of statements of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt – written off” (noting the amount of the debt that is bad and the date) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date this was done. Keeping records for credit control or other purposes 41. For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of written-off bad debts. For example, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem customers to avoid future difficulties. 13 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED 42. As long as these records are quite separate from the accounting base records they will not affect the write-off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts 43. Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company may prepare:  financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act 1993; and  management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. 44. The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, statutory requirements are set out in the Financial Reporting Act 2013 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements to provide very quick reports. 45. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, no difficulty arises. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. 46. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underlying debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to represent the firm’s financial position. For a company, these will be the accounts used to satisfy the company’s financial reporting obligations under the Companies Act 1993. Examples of when a bad debt is or is not written off 47. The following examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. General facts The following facts apply to all the following examples: • The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. • The only question is whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria relating to the deductibility of the debt for income tax and GST purposes are satisfied. • The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. • The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s gross income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is a GST-registered person, the following additional facts apply: 14 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED • GST returns are filed on a two-monthly invoice basis. • The supply has been included in a GST return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is updated on 31 March 2017. The entries made include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt will have been written off in the year ending 31 March 2017. Example 2 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 2017. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt will have been written off in the year ending 31 March 2018. Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claimed a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 2017. That return was prepared in February 2017. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. Claiming the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing-off of the bad debt for either GST or income tax purposes. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 2017. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to him are copies of issued invoices. The taxpayer maintains only rudimentary account books and his unpaid debtors are represented by loose-leaf filing of accounts and/or invoices issued in a ring-binder file. When a debt is paid, it (the account and/or invoice) is transferred to a separate file. The taxpayer ceases sending accounts for the debt in question in February 2017, putting a line across the copy of the last statement sent out for the debt and marking it “Final” and leaves it in the unpaid debtors’ file. The bad debt will not have been written off in the year ended 31 March 2017. Simply marking the last statement issued as “Final” and leaving it in the unpaid debtors’ file does not amount to writing off the debt. Example 5 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statements issued. In February 2017 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out statements for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 2017. The taxpayer continued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the statements for issue are prepared. 15 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out for the debt, circling the amount payable and marking it “bad debt – written off – February 2017”. The bad debt will have been written off in the year ending 31 March 2017. The cessation of statements of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging and marking of the final statement, amount to writing off the debt in his accounting system. Example 6 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 2017. The entries written up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. Her accountant prepares her accounts in June 2017. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 2017. The bad debt will have been written off in the year ending 31 March 2017 because the underlying accounting record of the debt was altered to recognise the bad debt on 31 March 2017. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 2017 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS” noting on the invoice next to the total amount “debt bad – filed 15/3/17”. The amount of trade debtors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 2017 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 2017 includes as income the sale that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 2017 includes the profit and loss statement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has arguably been written off in the underlying accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. The taxpayer would be allowed a tax deduction in the 2017 year if they used an accountant to complete their accounts for the year, perhaps to complete their income tax return, and that person made the required journal entries through the profit and loss statement and balance sheet to give effect to the write off of the bad debt made by the taxpayer on 15 March 2017. In that case the bad debt write off will be included in the profit and loss statement and balance sheet for the 2017 year and there would be no tax adjustment required in the tax reconciliation statement. Example 8 The taxpayer has a computer-based accounting software system where they enter all business receipts and invoices. The accounting software automatically updates the underlying ledger accounts when each transaction is entered. 16 PUB 18/07 UNCLASSIFIED The taxpayer considers an invoice a bad debt on 5 February 2017, and she enters a “Bad Debt” transaction into her accounting software on the same day. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Entering a “Bad Debt” transaction into her accounting software system will automatically update the underlying accounting records as at that date, and the debt will no longer be recognised as an asset in the accounts produced for the 2017 year ie, it will have gone through the profit and loss account and be removed from debtors in the balance sheet.

Key terms Donee organisation is a private school that is a registered charity or otherwise on Inland Revenue’s list of approved donee organisations. Parent includes a child’s guardian or caregiver who makes payments to a private school. Private school means a school registered under s 214 of the Education and Training Act 2020. QB 22/XX and QB 22/XX FS | Xx August 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction 1. Most payments parents make to their children’s private schools are subject to GST. This is because the payments are fees and are paid in return for the supply of education and education-related goods and services by the school. 2. Usually private schools will charge GST at the standard rate of 15% on the supplies they make to parents. But some boarding fees private schools charge might be subject to a lower rate of GST where they include a charge for the supply of domestic goods and services. 3. In addition to paying fees, parents might choose to donate money to their child’s private school. Where the school is a donee organisation, the parent may be entitled to claim a donation tax credit for these donations and the payments may be exempt from GST. 4. In the past, some parents have made payments incorrectly called “donations” to private schools in substitution for paying no or low school fees. There are no donation tax credits for any payments parents pay to private schools incorrectly described as “donations”, and such payments are subject to GST. Whether the payment is a fee or donation 5. Where the private school is a donee organisation, special rules apply to determine if payments made by parents to private schools are:  fees and subject to GST; or  donations, so exempt from GST, and the parent may be entitled to claim a donation tax credit. 6. The special rules are summarised in Flowchart 1. QB 22/XX and QB 22/XX FS | Xx August 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 4 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Flowchart 1: Applying the special rules to determine if payments are subject to or exempt from GST GST on boarding fees 7. Special rules apply for calculating the GST on school boarding fees. Where students have arranged to board at the school for more than four weeks, the school charges GST at a lower rate to the extent the boarding fee is for the supply of domestic goods and services. This covers the amount charged for the child’s right to occupy the boarding house (including ancillary supplies such as power, cleaning and other chattels related to that right to occupy the premises). Supplies of other non-domestic goods and services (such as meals, pastoral care and personal laundry services) are always subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. 8. The lower rate of GST for boarders staying more than four weeks applies from different dates, depending on whether the boarding house is used predominantly (that is, more than 70%) for stays exceeding four weeks. If it is, then the lower rate of GST applies from the first day of a boarder’s stay. If not, then the lower rate of GST does not apply until a boarder’s stay exceeds four weeks. 9. Flowchart 2 explains when a lower rate of GST applies to school boarding fees.

EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY Date of issue 1 UNCLASSIFIED Deadline for comment: 12 Nov 2019. Please quote reference: PUB00352. Question If a supplier determines they have incorrectly accounted for GST on a supply, can they make an adjustment under s 25 or are they limited to amending their return? Answer Where the previously agreed consideration is reduced by the amount of the GST incorrectly charged, s 25 will allow an adjustment only of an amount equal to GST on the amount by which the consideration is reduced. The GST treatment may be totally reversed only if the assessment for the period in which the GST was accounted for is amended under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 or if s 113A allows the error to be corrected. Explanation 1. This Question We’ve Been Asked (QWBA) addresses the situation where: • a supplier charged and accounted for GST at the standard rate on a supply; • the supplier later establishes that they incorrectly interpreted the legislation and should not have treated the supply as a taxable supply; and • the supplier then agrees to reduce the previously agreed consideration for the supply by an amount equal to the amount of the GST charged. 2. Section 25 applies where, as a result of any or more of the events described in s 25(1): • a tax invoice was issued for the incorrect amount of tax; or • the supplier has accounted for the incorrect amount of output tax. QB 19/XX Changing GST treatment after reducing the previously agreed consideration QUESTION WE’VE BEEN ASKED This QWBA explains how the GST treatment of a supply can be adjusted if a supplier accounted for output tax incorrectly. Key provision Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: s 25(1)(b) and (2) EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY QB 19/XX: Published date 2 UNCLASSIFIED 3. The events described in s 25(1) include an alteration in the previously agreed consideration: s 25(1)(b). Where a supplier has accounted for excess output tax as a result of the relevant event, the supplier is allowed a deduction for the amount calculated under s 25(2)(b): ss 20(3)(a)(iii) and (b)(iv). The deduction is allowed in the period in which it has become apparent that the output tax accounted for was incorrect. What deduction is allowed under s 25(2)(b)? 4. If a supplier discovers that a supply was incorrectly treated as a taxable supply and subsequently agrees to reduce the previously agreed consideration by an amount equal to the GST incorrectly charged, the adjustment calculated under s 25(2)(b) is limited to an amount equal to GST incorrectly accounted for as a result of the reduction in the consideration. The fact that the consideration was reduced because GST was incorrectly charged on the supply is not relevant because the reason for the reduction in the consideration is irrelevant. Therefore, the adjustment calculated under s 25(2)(b) would be an amount equal to GST on the difference between the original consideration and the reduced consideration. 5. The extent to which s 25 permits the GST treatment to be changed depends on the event that has resulted in the incorrect amount of output tax being accounted for. For example, as GST is not chargeable unless a supply is made (or deemed to be made), where a supply is cancelled or goods or services are returned after output tax on the supply was accounted for, the excess output tax accounted for as a result of the cancellation of the supply or the return of the goods or services would be the difference between the output tax accounted for and zero: ss 25(1)(a) and (c). How should a supplier correct the GST treatment of the supply? 6. If a supplier reduced the consideration for a supply that was incorrectly treated as a taxable supply, unless the tax discrepancy is below the threshold in s 113A(1) or 113A(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA), the GST treatment of the supply may be corrected only if the Commissioner exercises her discretion under s 113 of the TAA to amend the assessment for the period in which GST was accounted for. 7. The Standard Practice Statement ‘Requests to amend assessments’ (SPS16/1) outlines the Commissioner’s practice in exercising her discretion to amend assessments. Section 113A is explained in TIB Vol 31 No 3 (May 2019). Examples 8. The following examples explain how the law applies. EXPOSURE DRAFT – FOR COMMENT AND DISCUSSION ONLY QB 19/XX: Published date 3 UNCLASSIFIED Examples Example 1 – Supplier gives a discount Two years ago ABC Ltd issued a tax invoice for $115 showing GST of $15 for a supply of services. ABC Ltd accounted for output tax of $15 for the supply. ABC Ltd has now agreed to reduce the consideration to $100 because the recipient is not satisfied about the quality of the services supplied. ABC Ltd i s allowed a deduction for the excess output tax accounted for as a result of the reduction in the consideration. That amount is $1.96, which is the difference between the output tax actually accounted for (GST on $115 = $15) and the output tax chargeable on the reduced consideration (GST on $100 = $13.04). ABC Ltd is allowed the deduction for $1.96 in the taxable period in which the consideration was reduced. Example 2 – Supplier reduces consideration because GST incorrectly charged Five years ago, XYZ Ltd issued a tax invoice for $115 showing GST of $15 for a supply. XYZ Ltd accounted for output tax o f $ 15 for the supply. XYZ Ltd has now ascertained that t he supply should not have been treated as a taxable supply because it was an exempt supply. XYZ Ltd now decides to reduce the consideration charged for the supply to try to recover all of the GST overpaid. It agrees with the recipient of the supply to reduce the consideration by an amount equal to the GST charged, so that the consideration is reduced to $100. However, the excess output tax accounted for as a result of the reduction in the consideration is only $1.96 ( as with Example 1). XYZ Ltd is only entitled to adjust the GST treatment to that extent as a result of s 25(1)(b) applying. To change the GST treatment of the whole supply: • XYZ Ltd must ask the Commissioner to exercise her discretion under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to amend the assessment for the taxable period in which XYZ Ltd accounted for output tax on the supply; and • the Commissioner must agree to exercise her discretion.

This fact sheet summarises the tax treatment of acquiring, selling and surrendering NZUs in a forestry context. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 2 of 6 Summary of the tax treatment of NZUs 1.For GST purposes, all transfers of NZUs are zero-rated, so there is no amount of GST included on any purchases, receipts, surrenders and sales of NZUs. 2.For income tax purposes, NZUs are generally revenue account property. The general scheme for revenue account property is that any deduction for the cost of the property is carried forward and offset against any eventual proceeds on sale. For NZUs, this means there should not be a tax liability when the NZUs are received, held and surrendered for emission liabilities by a forester. Tax liabilities generally only arise when NZUs are sold. However, the different types of NZUs for tax purposes ha ve d ifferent tax consequences. Different types of NZUs for tax purposes 3.There are several types of NZUs for tax purposes in the forestry context: Pre-1990 forest land NZUs were provided to eligible foresters with pre-1990 f orest land under the forest land allocation plan. Post-1989 forest land NZUs are earned by foresters who are ETS participants with eligible post-1989 forest land. Permanent forestry sink Initiative (PFSI) NZUs were earned by foresters who had registered in the PFSI (which is now discontinued). Replacement forest land NZUs are NZUs that a forester has bought to replace post-1989 forest land NZUs that had been sold. To qualify, the forester must no t have previously acquired other NZUs to replace the sold post-1989 forest land NZUs. Standard NZUs (eg, bought at auction or from the secondary market). 4.Both pre-1990 and post-1989 forest land NZUs must remain held continuously by the o riginal recipient (or a party to a forestry rights agreement). They lose their tax status when they are transferred. Tax treatment of NZUs 5.All NZUs are treated as revenue account property. There are two key points in time when there may be tax consequences for foresters: on acquisition and at balance date; and on surrender and sale. IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 3 of 6 Acquisition and balance date 6.In summary, there are no income tax liabilities that arise at the time of acquisition of NZUs or while NZUs remain on hand at the end of the year. 7.At the end of each income year, forest land NZUs (including replacement forest land NZUs) have a deemed value of zero, and standard NZUs that are purchased have a deemed value equivalent to their cost. 8.Deductions for the cost of any purchased NZUs can be claimed in the year of purchase o nly when the NZUs are replacement forest land NZUs. Deductions for standard NZUs purchased are delayed until the income year in which the NZUs are sold or surrendered for an emissions liability (as revenue account property). Surrender and sale of NZUs 9.Disposals of NZUs may have tax consequences. 10.In very brief summary, sales of pre-1990 forest land NZUs (where the land was held on c apital account) are excluded income and do not incur an income tax liability. Sales of all other NZUs will give rise to taxable income. 11.On surrender for emissions liabilities, the surrender is generally treated as a deemed s ale that occurs for the value allocated to the NZUs at balance date. This means that there is no income tax liability arising at the time of surrender either because t he su rrender occurs for zero value or is deemed to occur for cost and is offset against an available deduction for that cost. 12.The tax consequences are summarised in Figure | Hoahoa 1. Figure | Hoahoa 1: Tax treatment of different types of NZUs Type of NZUs Acquisition and year end Surrender Sale Pre-1990 forest land NZUs On allocation, NZUs were exempt income. NZUs are valued at zero at the end of the income year. No tax consequences on surrender, as NZUs valued at zero. I f the land is held on capital account, amount received from the sale of NZUs is excluded income. If the land is held on revenue account, amount received from the sale of NZUs is taxable. No deduction for cost is available against the amount IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 4 of 6 received as the NZUs are valued at zero. Post-1989 forest land NZUs No tax consequences in the year of receipt. NZUs are valued at zero at the end of the income year. No tax consequences on surrender, as NZUs are valued at zero when surrendered for post-1989 forest land. The amount received from a sale is taxable. No deduction for cost is available against the amount received as the NZUs are valued at zero. Replacement forest land NZUs Deduction available for the cost of NZUs in the income year in which purchased. NZUs are valued at zero at the end of the income year. No tax consequences on surrender, as valued at zero when surrendered for post- 1989 forest land. Not relevant as to qualify as a replacement forest land NZUs these must be acquired for surrender. Standard NZUs (purchased NZUs and includes forest land NZUs that lose their status due to transfer) No deduction available for the cost of NZUs in the income year in which purchased. NZUs are valued at cost at the end of the income year. Valued at zero when surrendered for post- 1989 forest land. Deduction available for cost of NZUs at the time of surrender. The amount received from a sale is taxable. Deduction available for cost of NZUs at the time of sale. Examples 13.The above concepts are illustrated in the following examples. Example | Tauira 1: treatment of NZUs on harvest of post-1989 forest (stock change accounting) Flo’s Forestry Ltd owns an ETS registered standard post-1989 forest and uses stock change carbon accounting. The forest is 28 years old and is harvested in January 2024. Flo’s Forestry Ltd had received 10,000 NZUs for removal activities. The receipt of these NZUs is valued as being zero at the end of each income year up until the year of disposal. Flo’s Forestry Ltd was required to surrender 8,000 NZUs for emissions liabilities at the time of harvest. The 8,000 NZUs surrendered are deemed to be sold for zero.

E xample | Tauira 2: replacement forest land NZUs deductible Ray’s Radiatas Ltd owns an ETS registered standard post-1989 forest and uses stock change carbon accounting. The forest is 18 years old as at February 2024 and is not due to be harvested for several years. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd had received 16,000 NZUs for carbon removal activities. The receipt of these NZUs is valued as being zero at the end of each income year up until the year of disposal. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd needed funds, so decided to sell half the NZUs on the market. An NZU had a market value of $64 at the time of sale. 8,000 NZUs were sold for $512,000 in March 2024. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd will have an income tax liability for the year ended 31 March 2024 for this amount. The full amount received is taxable because no deductions are available for the cost of the NZUs. Prior to harvest, Ray’s Radiatas Ltd will need to acquire a sufficient amount of NZUs to fund its emissions liability. Those NZUs will be replacement forest land emissions units. In the income year of acquiring those units, a deduction is available for the cost of those units. In the income year of surrender, the NZUs surrendered (whether they are post-1989 forest land emissions units or the replacement forest land emissions units) will be treated as being sold for an amount of zero and no income tax liability will arise.

2002 (CCRA) that are used in this statement when considering the application of the tax provisions to forestry activities registered in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). For the full definitions, see s 4 of the CCRA. For ease of reference, this statement refers to emissions units as NZU s. F igure | Hoahoa 1 – Summary of key terms Term Summary Clearing includes felling, harvesting or killing trees; and for an area, when the forest species on the land are cleared Clear-felled when trees in permanent post-1989 forestry are cleared by human activity in an area of at least 1 hectare resulting in each hectare of land having less than 30% tree crown cover Deforestation occurs when forest land is either converted to non-forest land, or when a forest is cleared and not replanted or regenerated within relevant timeframes (in many cases, 4 years) ( see s 179 of the CCRA) Forest land is land of at least one hectare with tree crown cover from forest species of more than 30% in each hectare Forest species are trees capable of reaching five meters in height at maturity where it is located (but excludes trees grown for fruit or nut crops) Forestry activity for post-1989 forest land, includes owning the forest land, holding a registered forestry right for the land, being a leaseholder under a registered lease of the land or being a party to a Crown conservation contract in respect of the land IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 4 of 38 New Zealand Unit (NZU) means an emissions unit issued by the Registrar and designated as a New Zealand unit Participant is a person who is required or elects to be a participant in the ETS, and includes a person who acquires ETS registered post-1989 forest land Post-1989 forest land is primarily land that was not forest land on 31 December 1989, subsequently become forest land, and where foresters have elected to participate in the ETS. Status as post-1989 forest land is determined at the time a person applies to participate in the ETS. Pre-1990 forest land is land that was forested on 31 December 1989, remained forested on 31 December 2007, that was predominantly exotic forest (it does not include land that has been deforested and where NZUs were surrendered) Introduction | Whakataki 2.Emissions trading is a tool to encourage and enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. The ETS is a market managed by t he g overnment with the objective of assisting New Zealand to meet its international obligations and its 2050 target and emissions budgets. The ETS covers about half of all emissions in New Zealand including from fossil fuel, industrial processes and waste. 3.Participants that generate greenhouse gases need to surrender one NZU for each w hole tonne of carbon emissions from their relevant activities. 1 The number of NZUs available to the market reduces over time, which should cause prices to rise, incentivising participants to find ways to reduce their emissions. Participants can decide whether to cut their own emissions or effectively pay others to reduc e e missions by buying NZUs. 4.NZUs can be bought at government auctions or through the secondary market, including from people or entities with forestry activities (referred to in this statement as foresters) that earn NZUs for removal activities. 5.Foresters with post-1989 forest land are not required to participate in the ETS, but they may choose to do so. Where a forester chooses to participate, their forestry activities generate NZUs for removal activities. They may have obligations to report emissions and surrender NZUs when they clear a forest, deforest forest land or deregister from the ETS. 2 1 Section 63 of the CCRA. 2 Sections 54, 56, 57, 64, 186A, 186C of the CCRA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 5 of 38 6.This statement considers the income tax and GST issues that arise for foresters who have their forestry activities registered in the ETS. This statement is limited to considering tax issues arising from participating in the ETS and does not consider other tax issues that arise for the forestry sector more generally, or general issues with the ETS. Note for submitters – an accompanying statement is also being prepared for other industries registered in the ETS, focusing on those who receive free NZUs from industrial allocation. Further information 7.For general information on the ETS, see the following resources: Environment Protection Authority webpage Emissions Trading Scheme Ministry for the Environment webpage New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme Ministry for Primary Industries webpage Forestry in the Emissions Trading Scheme Leining, C A Gu ide to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme: 2022 update (Motu, 2022). Guide to using this statement 8.Th is statement first summarises how the ETS applies to forestry activities and introduces the ETS concepts relevant for tax purposes. This includes the types of forests that may be registered, which give rise to different types of NZUs for tax purposes. For a summary, see Figure | Hoahoa 2. 9.The statement then explains the general income tax treatment of NZUs in the forestry context. This includes the tax treatment of NZUs when received, held, sold o r s urrendered for emissions liabilities. The statement also discusses what deductions may be available for different types of NZUs. For a summary, see Figure | Hoahoa 3. 10.The statement also considers specific events or transactions involving NZUs: f orestry rights agreements including the transfer of NZUs (see from \[81\]) ; deregistering from the ETS or changing forestry activities (see from \[88\]); sales of ETS registered forests including purchase price allocation (see from \[112\]) ; and arrangements involving NZUs (see from \[140\]). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 6 of 38 11.Finally, the statement briefly comments on GST (see from \[163\]). How the ETS applies to forestry activities 12.To understand the income tax consequences for NZUs earned by foresters, it is important to first be aware of how the ETS applies to forestry activities. Concepts i n th e CCRA and the ITA 2007 are linked. 13.Under the CCRA, a person with a forestry activity: must be a participant if they deforest pre-1990 forest land (sch 3, part 1 or 1A) or if they acquire post-1989 forest land that is ETS registered; or may choose to be a participant for a forestry activity that is standard forestry or permanent forestry on post-1989 forest land (schedule 4, part 1 or 1A). 14.The concepts of pre-1990 forest land and post-1989 forest land are vital to how the ETS applies to the particular forest land, and in turn to how the ITA 2007 applies to the NZUs. Pre-1990 forest land 15.The ETS uses 1 January 1990 as a starting point for measuring changes in forest gr owth, so a distinction exists in the treatment of forest land established before or after that date. This was a result of New Zealand adopting international climate change agreements. 3 16.Land that qualified as forest land on 31 December 1989, remained forest land on 31 December 2007 and was predominately exotic forest on that date is known as “pre- 1990 forest land”. It does not include certain types of land (such as land that was deforested and any emissions liability met). 17.When the ETS was introduced with effect from 1 January 2008, foresters with eligible pre-1990 forest land could apply for the forest land allocation plan and received NZUs in two tranches (on approval and in 2013). These foresters do not receive any further 3 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN Doc A/AC.237/18 (Part II)/Add.1; 31 ILM 849, 1992), the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN Doc FCCC/CP/1997/7/Add.1, December 1997)), and the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, Adoption of the Paris Agreement (UN Doc FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev/1, 12 December 2015)). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 7 of 38 NZU entitlements for the growth of the forest and are not liable for surrendering NZUs unless their forest land is deforested. 4 Post-1989 forest land 18.Post-1989 forest land is land that is currently forest land and is primarily land on which forest was first established after 31 December 1989. It includes land that: was not forest land on 31 December 1989; was forest land on 31 December 1989 but was deforested before 31 December 2007; o r w as pre-1990 forest land but was deforested after 1 January 2008 and a liability to surrender NZUs was satisfied. 5 19.Forestry activities on post-1989 forest land do not have to be ETS registered. A f orester that chooses not to participate does not receive any NZUs for removal activities but also does not have to surrender NZUs. Standard forests 20.Post-1989 standard forests (eg, forests intended to be harvested) have two different treatments: Standard forests registered in the ETS before 1 January 2023 use the stock change method for carbon accounting. These foresters earn NZUs based on t he f orest growth and must surrender NZUs to cover emissions if the carbon stock declines (eg, from harvesting). Standard forests registered in the ETS from 1 January 2023 use the averagin g method for carbon accounting. 6 These foresters earn NZUs as the forest grows o n its first rotation, up to the long-term average age. 7 They do not earn further NZUs for subsequent rotations. These foresters usually only need to surrender NZUs if the land is deforested or if they deregister from the ETS. 21.The difference between the two methods is essentially that averaging accounts for emissions and removals by reference to the expected long-term average level of 4 Foresters had an option to apply for an exemption from deforestation liabilities if they owned less than 50 hectares of forest. Otherwise, deforestation liabilities arise under Part 5, subpart 2 and sch 3, part 1 and 1A of the CCRA. 5 Section 4 of the CCRA. 6 There was an opportunity for forests registered between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2022 to change to averaging. 7 This depends on the forest type and clearance age. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 8 of 38 carbon stock over multiple rotations rather than by referring to short term changes in the actual carbon stock which is the method used in stock change accounting. Permanent forests 22.From 1 January 2023, new permanent forest rules were introduced. These rules replaced the previous Permanent Forest Sink Initiative (PFSI) under the Forests Act 1949, which was removed on 1 January 2024. 23.Permanent forestry uses the stock change carbon accounting method, so NZUs are earned based on the ongoing growth of the forest. 24.When registered as a permanent forest, the land must not be clear-felled or deforested. Limited clearing of permanent forests is permitted but NZUs must be surrendered for any carbon stock loss. There are also restrictions on changing fro m r egistration as a permanent forest, and approval must be sought. Pecuniary penalties apply under the CCRA for clear-felling or deforesting permanent forests. 25.The permanent forestry period is an initial period of 50 years. After the initial 50-year period ends, the forester must choose whether to: remain in permanent forestry for a further 25-year period (and continue to ear n N ZUs); or remove the land from permanent forestry either by deregistering from the ETS or moving the forest into standard forestry and use averaging accounting. 26.If the option is taken to move the forest into standard forestry, the forester needs to surrender any NZUs earned above the long-term average. If the option is taken to deregister from the ETS, the forester needs to surrender the NZUs earned for the fores t l and. Permanent forest sink initiative (now discontinued) 27.Under the PFSI, a covenant was registered against the land title and provided foresters a right to terminate after a certain number of years (with surrender of NZUs). 28.Until 1 January 2024, PFSI participants could either opt into the ETS as a standard post- 1989 forest using averaging accounting, or permanent post 1989-forest. If no decision was made the participants were moved into permanent forestry. If the PFSI participan t mo ved to standard forestry and if they had carbon stock above the average, they needed to surrender any excess NZUs. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 38 Difference between clearing and deforestation 29.As noted above, surrender liabilities can arise in some cases on clearing (post-1989 forests that use stock-change accounting) and for all deforestation (pre-1990 forest s a nd post-1989 forests). 30.Clearing occurs where the forest species are killed over an area of land. Under stock- change accounting, an emissions liability arises if the carbon stock declines (whic h need s to be met when the emissions return is submitted). There are exclusions for temporary clearing arising from adverse events. While a permanent forest may not be c lear-felled, limited clearing is permitted but NZUs must be surrendered for any carbon stock loss (reported in an emissions return). 31.Generally, deforestation occurs when forest land is converted to another land use, or if a forest is cleared and not re-established in time. Deforestation is deemed to occur o n th e date that the first action is taken that is inconsistent with the land being forest lan d o r when re-establishment tests are not met (4, 10, or 20 years after clearance). 8 32.However, both pre-1990 and post-1989 forest land is treated as not being deforested i n some cases. For example, land is not treated as being deforested if cleared land i s c ontiguous with the edge of the forest land, is less than 1 hectare or 30 metres wide , a nd is required to be cleared as part of New Zealand’s best practice forest management. 33.Example | Tauira 1 illustrates the different NZU earning and surrender liabilities that arise for different types of forests. Example | Tauira 1 – NZU surrender obligations for different types of forests Tony’s Timber Ltd owns several ETS registered forests. Forestry Block A is pre-1990 forest land. Tony’s Timber Ltd received NZUs in a forest land allocation plan. The timber was harvested, and the forest was replanted for a second rotation. Tony’s Timber Ltd did not need to surrender NZUs at the time of harvest but would need to surrender NZUs if the land is subsequently deforested. Forestry Block B is ETS registered as a standard post-1989 forest using stock change carbon accounting. Tony’s Timber Ltd earns NZUs in accordance with the growth of the forest. When this forest is harvested, Tony’s Timber Ltd must surrender NZUs. If Forestry Block B is replanted for a second rotation, those trees will earn NZUs as they grow. 8 Section 179 of the CCRA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 10 of 38 Forestry Block C is ETS registered as a standard post-1989 forest using averaging carbon accounting on its first rotation. Tony’s Timber Ltd will earn NZUs up to the nominal average carbon stock, but after that date no further NZUs will be earned, including for subsequent rotations. Generally, an NZU surrender liability will only arise if Tony’s Timber Ltd deforests or deregisters from the ETS. Forestry Block D is ETS registered as post-1989 permanent forestry using stock change accounting. Tony’s Timber Ltd will earn NZUs in accordance with the growth of the forest. This forest may not be clear-felled for at least 50 years. There will be NZU surrender liabilities if the carbon stock declines. Following the end of the 50-year period, Tony’s Timber Ltd will need to decide whether to continue in permanent forestry for another 25 years, move to averaging which triggers surrender liabilities or exit the ETS, which will also have surrender liabilities. Types of NZUs earned from forestry activities 34.NZUs that are generated by foresters for removal activities are classed as “forest land e missions units” under s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 (forest land NZUs). A forest land NZU is a : pr e-1990 forest land emissions unit (pre-1990 forest land NZU) ; po st-1989 forest land emissions unit (post-1989 forest land NZU); o r f orest sink emissions unit (now discontinued). 35.These types of NZUs have special rules for income tax purposes. 36.Under the ITA 2007, a pre-1990 forest land NZU is an NZU that is transferred to the person under part 4, subpart 2 of the CCRA and must remain held continuously by that recipient or a party to a forestry rights agreement. 37.Other than in two specific contexts (forestry rights agreements and arrangements s ubject to s EW 52B of the ITA 2007) no rollover relief is provided for any transfers of these types of NZUs to other parties (including transfers to partners of a partnership). This means that, other than in the two situations mentioned, if pre-1990 forest lan d N ZUs are transferred by a forester to another party, they will lose that status for income tax purposes and be treated the same as standard NZUs (like those acquired a t a uction or from the secondary market). 38.Under the ITA 2007, a post-1989 forest land NZU is an NZU that is transferred to the person under s 64 of the CCRA for growing trees on post-1989 forest land and must be held continuously by that recipient or a party to a forestry rights agreement. Other than in the context of a forestry rights agreement, no rollover relief is provided for IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 38 transfers of these types of NZUs to other parties. If post-1989 forest land NZUs are transferred to another party, they will lose that status for tax purposes and be treated the same as standard NZUs (like those acquired at auction or from the market). 39.A specific category of NZUs is referred to in the ITA 2007 (s YA 1) as “replacement forest land emissions units”. This is an NZU that the person acquired if they: previously disposed of a post-1989 forest land NZU (other than throug h s urrender under the CCRA); and have not acquired another NZU to replace the NZUs that were disposed of. 40.There is no specific timing requirement for an acquisition of an NZU to qualify as a replacement forest land NZU. That is, the NZU does not have to be acquired to satisfy an imminent liability. The forester must simply have sold (or disposed of other than by way of surrender) post-1989 forest land NZUs and not have acquired another NZU tha t r eplaces it. In that case, an NZU acquired by the forester is a replacement forest lan d NZU. 41.Given the different types of forest land NZUs for tax purposes, foresters are advised to keep records of the types of NZUs they hold for tax purposes, and for example, could use separate inventory records for each type of NZU. The emissions unit register does not separately identify some types of NZUs held (because some of these are tax concepts). 42.The above discussion is summarised in Figure | Hoahoa 2. Figure | Hoahoa 2 – Features of NZUs from forestry activities Type of NZUs Features Pre-1990 forest land NZUs Pre-1990 forest land is land that was forested on 31 December 1989, remained forested on 31 December 2007, and was predominantly exotic forest at that later time. (It does not include land that has been deforested). These NZUs were allocated to foresters under the Forest Land Allocation Plan. No further allocations are made for future growth of these forests. These NZUs must remain held continuously by the original recipient (or a party to a forestry rights agreement) otherwise they lose their tax status. Post-1989 forest land NZUs Post-1989 forest land is primarily land that was not forest land on 31 December 1989. These NZUs are transferred to a forester under s 64 of the CCRA for removal activities. The NZUs are allocated to foresters over time (depending on the carbon accounting method used). These NZUs must remain held continuously by the original recipient (or a party to a forestry rights agreement) otherwise they lose their tax status. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 12 of 38 Replacement forest land NZUs These NZUs are acquired by a forester who has previously sold post-1989 forest land NZUs and has not previously acquired other NZUs to replace the post-1989 forest land NZUs that were sold. Standard NZUs All other NZUs a forester acquires, or any of the above types of NZUs that have lost their status (eg, because they have been transferred to another person). General income tax treatment of NZUs 43.This part of the statement explains how the ITA 2007 applies to a forester’s receipt and disposal of NZUs. Receipt of forest land NZUs for removal activities 44.Where an ETS registered forester receives NZUs for removal activities (whether using the stock change or averaging accounting method), those NZUs would generally be i ncome derived from the forestry activity. However, there are no tax consequences for the forester in the year of receiving the NZUs for removal activities. Instead, taxable income is delayed until the forester sells the NZUs. 45.Where pre-1990 forest land NZUs were previously allocated to foresters, a t the time of allocation the receipt of those NZUs was exempt income under s CW 3B provided the land was held on capital account. 46.Th e matching rules in subpart ED apply to revenue account property that is an ex cepted financial arrangement. Revenue account property is defined in s YA 1 as property that if disposed of for consideration would produce income, and specifically includes an emissions unit. A n emissions unit is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(3B) (so is not subject to the financial arrangements rules). Therefore, NZUs are subject to subpart ED. 47.When a person has an NZU, its value at the end of the income year is income under s CH 1 and its value at the beginning of an income year is deductible under s DB 49. Section ED 1(1) is the general rule for determining that value. That section provides that NZUs are generally valued at cost at the end of each income year. However, ther e a re specific rules that apply to forest land NZUs. 48.Section ED 1(7B)(b) applies to forest land NZUs and specifies a value at the end of the year of zero. This includes the year in which the NZUs were received. 49.Where foresters hold their forest land NZUs over several income years, there are no income tax consequences. As noted above, s ED 1(7B) provides that the value of a forest land NZU is zero at the end of the income year. This value is relevant for determining an amount of income at the end of the year (s CH 1) which would be zero, IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 13 of 38 and the amount of deduction at the beginning of the next income year (s DB 49) which would also be zero. 50.Therefore, there are no income tax consequences for a forester in the income year in which they earn NZUs for removal activities, or when they continue to hold those NZUs at the end of an income year. Sale of NZUs 51.Under s CB 36, amounts derived from the disposal of NZUs are income. Therefore, if a person sells an NZU, the amount received from that sale is generally taxable. 52.Recent amendments to s GC 1 mean there is generally no requirement that the NZUs must be treated as sold for market value if the transaction occurs in the course of carrying on a business and does not occur between associated persons. 9 53.However, the amount derived from a sale is not taxable in certain situations involving pre-1990 forest land NZUs. This is where: the NZU is a pre-1990 forest land NZU and the forest land is held on capital account (the amount is excluded income under s CX 51B); o r th e amount is derived from a transfer of a pre-1990 forest land NZU under a l ending arrangement subject to s EW 5(11C) ( the amount is excluded incom e un der s CX 54B). 54.In the context of a forest land NZU, because no cost was incurred in acquiring the NZU, the full amount received on a sale is taxable income and no deduction is available. Foresters are specifically disallowed a deduction for their emissions liabilities under ss DB 60 and DB 60B, discussed below. Surrender of NZUs 55.When a disposal of NZUs occurs through surrender under the CCRA, rather than a sale, s CB 36 contains a series of rules deeming what the amount of income is treated as being in each situation. 56.Under s 63 of the CCRA, an ETS participant is liable to surrender one NZU for each w hole tonne of emissions from the relevant activity, as calculated under the CCRA. For example, foresters will have emissions liabilities where they: deforest pre-1990 forest land; use averaging accounting and deforest post-1989 forest land; 9 Associated persons are defined in ss YB 1 to YB 16 of the ITA 2007. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 38 use stock change accounting and clear a forest on post-1989 forest land; or have reductions in the carbon stock in a permanent post-1989 forest. 57.For present purposes, if a person disposes of their NZUs by way of surrender under the CCRA, they are treated as having sold the NZU for a value specified under s CB 36. If no specific provisions apply, the value is treated as being the cost of the NZU. Specific types of surrender 58.A forester is treated as selling an NZU for a value of zero if they surrender the NZU: in relation to post-1989 forest land; or for deforestation of pre-1990 forest land where the land is held on revenue a ccount (where the land is held on capital account any disposal of the NZU is exempt). 59.A forester is treated as selling an NZU for market value if a post-1989 forest land NZU is surrendered other than for emissions relating to post-1989 forest land. This is discussed in more detail when considering the consequences of deregistering from t he ETS. Surrender of pre-1990 forest land NZUs for post-1989 forest land liabilities 60.If pre-1990 forest land NZUs are surrendered to meet a post-1989 forest land liability, special rules apply (s DB 61). In this situation, the person is treated as having: disposed of the pre-1990 forest land NZUs to an unrelated person immediately before the surrender; and having then reacquired the NZUs immediately before the surrender; in both cases for an amount equal to the NZU’s market value at the time. 61.The result of s DB 61 applying is as follows: Pre-1990 forest land NZUs are treated as being sold to a third party for market va lue immediately before surrender. This market value amount will be exempt income if the land was held on capital account, or taxable income if the land was held on revenue account. The person is treated as having reacquired the NZUs at market value at the same time. This deemed amount would form the cost of the newly acquired NZUs. The person then surrenders the NZUs in relation to post-1989 forest land. Section CB 36 treats this as occurring for zero value, so there is no income. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 38 The surrender of the NZUs is a disposal of the NZUs. This event triggers the a vailable deduction for cost under the revenue account property rules. 62.Therefore, if the land in respect of which the pre-1990 forest land NZUs were granted w as held on capital account, the person has no income on the deemed sale at market value, no income on the surrender of the NZUs, and a market value deduction for t he c ost of the new NZUs on disposal. Ultimately, the forester in this situation receives a net deduction, similar to any other person who has to acquire NZUs for surrender. 63.If the land in respect of which the pre-1990 forest land NZUs were granted was held on revenue account, this treatment results in income on the deemed sale at market value, no income on the surrender of the NZUs, and then a market value deduction for t he cos t of the new NZUs on disposal. Ultimately this forester is in a neutral tax position (because the deductible cost of the new NZUs is deemed to be the same value as the income on deemed disposal). What deductions are available 64.The availability of a deduction for the acquisition of an NZU depends on the type of NZU acquired. Forest land NZUs 65.Under s DB 60, where NZUs are transferred to foresters for removal activities, pre-1990 forest land, or under a permanent forest scheme, the forester is not allowed a deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred as consideration (if any) for the NZU. Therefore, the ‘cost’ of acquiring these NZUs (if any) is not deductible. 10 66.Section DB 60B provides that a forester who is liable for emissions (eg, due to clearing or deforestation) is denied a deduction for that liability. 67.Therefore, a forester does not have any deductions in respect of NZUs earned for removal activities. They do not receive a deduction for the cost of the NZU on sale or surrender because the NZUs are valued at zero for tax purposes. They also do no t r eceive a deduction for any emissions liabilities. Purchased NZUs 68.Generally, under the matching rules in subpart ED, a deduction is not available for the a cquisition cost of NZUs until the NZUs are disposed of (eg, by way of sale or 10 Section 64 of the CCRA applies in relation to the issue of NZUs to foresters for removal activities. Part 4, subpart 2 of the CCRA related to pre-1990 forest land units. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 38 surrender). However, different treatment applies for purchased NZUs that are replacement forest land NZUs. Replacement forest land NZUs 69.A “replacement forest land emissions unit” is an NZU that the person acquired if they: previously disposed of a post-1989 forest land NZU (other than through s urrender under the CCRA); and have not previously acquired another NZU to replace the NZUs that were disposed of. 70.Deductions for the cost of these NZUs are available at the time of acquisition. Effectively, this recognises that the disposal of the post-1989 forest land NZUs (other than by way of surrender) would have resulted in taxable income to the forester. T he key factor is that the NZUs are acquired to replace post-1989 forest land NZUs that w ere disposed of, and no previous replacements have been acquired since t he d isposal. 71.If a forester has acquired replacement forest land NZUs, the deductibility of the acquisition cost of these NZUs would fall under ordinary principles. Generally, this would be deductible as an expense incurred in carrying on a forestry business for t he pu rpose of deriving income under s DA 1. 72.A replacement forest land NZU is valued at zero at the end of the year (s ED 1(7B)) . The difference with other forest land NZUs is that in this case the forester has paid an amount to acquire the replacement NZU (and a deduction for that cost is no t di sallowed under s DB 60). Therefore, the revaluation of the replacement NZU to zero at the end of the year means the deduction is generated in the year of purchase under the matching rules. That is, the deductible cost is the amount the person paid to acquire the NZU, and the income at the end of the year to offset that cost is zero. This treatment applies only for NZUs that meet the definition of a replacement forest land NZU. 73.For example, the following scenarios would not qualify as a replacement forest land N ZU: purchasing more NZUs where post-1989 forest land NZUs had not been sold or where replacement NZUs have already been acquired; acquiring land or a forest with an emissions liability, where the forester is required to purchase NZUs for that emissions liability; or the sale of pre-1990 NZUs and acquisition of NZUs to satisfy an emission s lia bility. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 38 Summary of general tax treatment of NZUs 74.There is no tax liability in the year of receipt of forest land NZUs (or while they remain o n hand) as these NZUs are treated as being valued at zero while they are held by the forester. 75.There is a tax liability for the sale of any forest land NZUs on the full amount received for the sale. There is no deduction for the cost of the forest land NZU (as it is held at zero) , so the full sale proceeds are taxable. 76.There is no tax liability when NZUs are surrendered for emissions liabilities under the C CRA. Generally, this is deemed to occur for a value of zero (when surrendered i n r elation to post-1989 forest land). 77.Generally, no deductions are available to foresters for any costs of forest land NZUs they earn for removal activities, or for their emissions liabilities. A forester can recei ve a deduction in the year of purchase only if they acquire replacement forest land NZUs. In other cases where a forester buys NZUs, but which are not replacement forest lan d NZ Us, the deduction is delayed until disposal. 78.A summary of the general tax treatment is provided in Figure | Hoahoa 3. Figure | Hoahoa 3 – Summary of tax treatment of NZUs for forestry activities Type of NZUs Acquisition and year end Surrender Sale or transfer Timing of deductions Pre-1990 forest land NZUs On allocation, NZUs were exempt income. Valued at zero at the end of the income year. Generally, no income tax consequences on surrender, as valued at zero when surrendered. If surrendered for post-1989 forest land, special rules apply (see from \[60\]). If the land is held on capital account, the amount received from the sale of NZUs is excluded income. If the land is held on revenue account, the amount received from the sale of NZUs is taxable. No deductions are available. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 38 Post-1989 forest land NZUs No income tax consequence in the year of receipt. Valued at zero at the end of the income year. No income tax consequences on surrender, as valued at zero when surrendered for post-1989 forest land. The amount received from a sale is taxable. No deductions are available. Replacement forest land NZUs These NZUs are purchased. Valued at zero at the end of the income year. No income tax consequences on surrender, as valued at zero when surrendered for post-1989 forest land. To qualify as replacement forest land NZUs these are acquired to replace post-1989 NZUs and would be required for surrender However, if sold the amount received is taxable. The cost of purchasing NZUs is deductible. A deduction for the cost of these NZUs is available in the income year in which purchased. NZUs acquired on the market or at auction includes forest land NZUs that lose their status due to transfer These NZUs are purchased. Valued at cost at the end of the income year. Valued at zero when surrendered for post-1989 forest land The amount received from a sale is taxable. The cost of purchasing NZUs is deductible. A deduction for the cost of NZUs is available only at the time of disposal (surrender or sale). 79.The above concepts are illustrated in Example | Tauira 2 and Example | Tauira 3. Example | Tauira 2 – Harvest of post-1989 forest (stock change accounting) Flo’s Forestry Ltd owns an ETS registered standard post-1989 forest and uses stock change carbon accounting. The forest is 28 years old and is harvested in January 2024. Flo’s Forestry Ltd received 10,000 NZUs for removal activities. The receipt of these NZUs is valued as being zero at the end of each income year up until the year of disposal. Flo’s Forestry Ltd was required to surrender 8,000 NZUs for emissions liabilities at the time of harvest. The 8,000 NZUs surrendered are deemed to be sold for zero . No deductions are available in respect of the cost or surrender of the NZUs or for any emissions liabilities. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 38 The remaining 2,000 NZUs were sold on the market. An NZU had a market value of $64 at the time of sale. Flo’s Forestry Ltd will have an income tax liability for the year ended 31 March 2024 for the amounts received from the sale of 2,000 NZUs on the market, which was $128,000. The full amount received is taxable because no deductions are available for the cost of the NZUs. E xample | Tauira 3 – Replacement forest land NZUs Ray’s Radiatas Ltd owns an ETS registered standard post-1989 forest and uses stock change carbon accounting. The forest is 18 years old as at February 2024 and is not due to be harvested for several years. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd received 16,000 NZUs for removal activities. The receipt of these NZUs is valued as being zero at the end of each income year up until the year of disposal. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd needed funds, so sold half the NZUs on the market. An NZU had a market value of $64 at the time of sale. In March 2024, 8,000 NZUs were sold for $512 ,000. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd will have an income tax liability for the year ended 31 March 2024 for this amount. The full amount received is taxable because no deductions are available for the cost of the NZUs. Before harvest, Ray’s Radiatas Ltd needs to acquire a sufficient amount of NZUs to fund its emissions liability. Those NZUs will be replacement forest land emissions units. In the income year of acquiring those NZUs, a deduction is available for the cost of those units. In the income year of surrender, the NZUs surrendered (whether they are post-1989 forest land NZUs or replacement forest land NZUs) will be treated as being sold for an amount of zero and no income tax liability will arise. Specific events or transactions 80.This part of the statement considers common transactions and events that may arise for foresters who have ETS registered forestry activities. These transactions and events are: forestry rights agreements ; IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 20 of 38 deregistering from the ETS and changing forestry activities; sales of ETS registered forests, along with NZUs; and sale and repurchase agreements for NZUs and off-take arrangements. Forestry rights agreements 81.Under the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983, a landowner can grant a forestry right to themselves or a third party. 82.The forestry right may be to establish, maintain and harvest a crop of trees on the land. The forestry right may also grant access rights and the use of tracks and bridges. I t m ay also provide for charges, payments, royalties or division of the crop, including t he r ight to receive and obligation to surrender NZUs. 83.Under these agreements, only one party (either the landowner or the rights holder) can register under the ETS and receive the NZUs generated by the forest and be liable for any emissions. The parties to such an agreement should ensure the rights and obligations regarding NZUs are covered in that agreement. Section 182A of the CCRA specifies that only the landowner of the land, the holder of a registered forestry righ t o r the leaseholder of a registered lease may be registered as an ETS participant. Where a forestry rights agreement exists, both parties must agree in writing which relevant party is to register as the participant. 84.Where a person is a rights holder under a forestry rights agreement, they can receive a transfer of NZUs from the other party in accordance with the agreement without tax consequences. The s YA 1 definition of a “post-1989 forest land emissions unit” includes an NZU that is transferred by one party to the other party to a forestry rights agreement, where the transfer occurs under a provision of the forestry rights agreement relating to the allocation of income or emissions units between the parties. This means that, unlike other disposals, a post-1989 forest land NZU retains its statu s w hen transferred in accordance with a forestry rights agreement. Therefore, t he pr ovisions applying to post 1989 forest land NZUs (as discussed earlier) also apply to transferees under a forestry rights agreement. 85.The disposal of an NZU under a forestry rights agreement is subject to s CB 36. Generally, any amount received for that disposal is income to the transferor of t he NZ U. However, if the NZUs are transferred for no amount in accordance with the forestry rights agreement, no deemed income arises under s GC 1. This is becaus e s GC 3B excludes from s GC 1 the transfer of a forest land NZU to a party to a forestry rights agreement as required by that agreement. 86.For completeness, entering into forestry rights agreements has income tax consequences more generally (other than in relation to ETS issues) and parties to such agreements should seek advice. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 38 Example | Tauira 4 – Forestry rights agreement Farmer Frank Ltd has three farms across the North Island that contain several hectares of marginal farmland unsuitable for grazing. Farmer Frank Ltd enters into a forestry rights agreement with C ara’s Carbon Farm Ltd, under which Cara’s Carbon Farm Ltd will establish, maintain and harvest the forests on that land. The agreement specifies that Cara’s Carbon Farm Ltd is the relevant ETS participant. Under the forestry rights agreement, Cara’s Carbon Farm Ltd will pay Farmer Frank Ltd for the grant of the forestry right, and Cara’s Carbon Farm Ltd will receive all NZUs and be liable for any ETS obligations. If any NZUs are transferred in accordance with the forestry rights agreement for no consideration, they retain their status as post-1989 forest land NZUs and no income tax obligations arise from the transfer of those NZUs. Deregistration and changing forestry activities 87.Various surrender obligations arise under the CCRA when a forester changes their activity, whether they deregister all or part of their land from the ETS, change the type of forestry activity they are undertaking, or change their carbon accounting methods. Deregistering from the ETS 88.Section 186 of the CCRA applies when a person ceases participation in a forestry activity. This section applies whether the person is ceasing to be a participant in t he E TS altogether or is removing a particular area of land or part of an area from t he E TS. 11 The person is liable to surrender the number of NZUs equal to the unit balance o f the area that is removed from the ETS. 12 89.Section CB 36 explains how to value a surrender of NZUs under the CCRA. Under s CB 36(4), the surrender of an NZU for post-1989 forest land is valued at zero. However, if a post-1989 forest land NZU is surrendered for something other than a n e missions liability, it is treated as having been sold for market value (s CB 36(6)). 90.Sections 186, 186A and 186B of the CCRA provide for the surrender liability where a person ceases participation in the ETS (for either the whole or part of the land). These provisions do not deem that surrender to be for an emissions liability o n the forest 11 A participant could remove a whole carbon accounting area (CAA) or part of a CAA (s 186B and 186D CCRA). Where there is a part removal, there may be emissions liabilities and also a requirement to surrender the unit balance for that area. 12 Section 186A of the CCRA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 22 of 38 land. As a comparison, a person transferring between forestry categories ( eg from standard forestry to permanent forestry) is specifically deemed to have an “emissions liability” from the land under s 189G(4) of the CCRA. 91.Therefore, if a person deregisters from the ETS, the surrender of post-1989 forest land NZUs that arise from deregistration is treated as being sold for market value under s CB 36(6). This means that, despite not receiving anything for that deemed sale, the person has to account for tax as if they had sold those NZUs. 92.It is important to note that a deregistration liability is different to an emissions liability that arises if a forest is cleared (and NZUs must be surrendered) prior to deregistration. 93.Ultimately, the surrender liability for deregistering from the ETS is tax neutral. As noted earlier, foresters are specifically denied a deduction for emissions liabilities under s DB 60B. This includes liabilities for surrendering NZUs from clearing a forest o r f or deforestation. As noted above, the liability to surrender NZUs for deregisterin g f rom the ETS is separate to a surrender liability for clearing or deforestation and is not deemed to be for an “emissions liability”. This means foresters can deduct the liability for surrendering NZUs on deregistration. This liability will arise at the time the forester deregisters the land from the ETS. 94.The fact deductions are expressly disallowed for this expenditure under s DB 60B for emissions liabilities relating to post-1989 forest land indicates that in other cases suc h a mounts are permitted as deductible expenditure. The exclusion for emissions for post-1989 forest land was put in place because the surrender liability for those NZUs is treated as occurring at a price of zero (s CB 36(4)). This deduction on deregistration would arise under the general permission in s DA 1, as being an amount of expenditure f or which the forester is definitively committed (at the time the liability arises – that is, when the forester gives notice that they are removing the land or ceasing to be a participant in the ETS) in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 95.Therefore, foresters who deregister from the ETS and have a surrender liability for NZUs as a result of deregistering will, ultimately, have a neutral tax liability. While they are deemed to receive income equivalent to the market value of the NZUs surrendered, this is offset by the deduction for the liability to surrender those NZUs. 96.As noted, any liability to surrender NZUs that arises for deregistration is separate to a liability that arises on clearing or deforestation. No deductions are available for liabilities that arise on clearing or deforestation that occurs prior to deregistering. Transferring interests 97.If an ETS registered participant transfers their forestry interest to another person, the t ransferor is liable for any obligations that arose while they were participant in respect IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 38 of the transferred interest. 13 They must submit a final forestry emissions return up until that date. 14 The transferee will become the relevant participant from the date of transfer and will be liable for any obligations after that time. 98.Figure | Hoahoa 4 summarises the main types of transfers of interests of ETS registered f orestry activities that could occur and the effect for the new participants. Figure | Hoahoa 4 – Transfers of interests under the ETS ETS participant Interest transferred New ETS participant New forestry activity Landowner of post-1989 forest land Sale of post-1989 forest land New landowner Owning post-1989 forest land Grant of registered forestry right Forestry right holder (if parties agree and MPI is notified) 15 Holding a registered forestry right over post-1989 forest land Grant of registered lease Lessee (if parties agree and MPI is notified) Being a lessee under a registered lease of post-1989 forest land Holder of a registered forestry right over post- 1989 forest land Transfer of registered forestry right New forestry right holder Holding a registered forestry right over post-1989 forest land Termination of registered forestry right The landowner of the post-1989 forest land Owning post-1989 forest land Leaseholder under a registered lease of post- 1989 forest land Transfer of interest in registered lease New lessee Being the leaseholder under a registered lease of post- 1989 forest land Termination of registered lease The landowner of the post-1989 forest land Owning post-1989 forest land 99.As stated previously, transfers of forest land NZUs that may occur during transfers of forestry interests generally lose their status for tax purposes (except in accordance wit h 13 This may be referred to as a transfer of participation. 14 Section 187 of the CCRA 15 MPI administers the forestry section of the ETS under delegated authority from the EPA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 38 a forestry rights agreement) and are required to be treated by the new participant in the same way as NZUs acquired from the market or at auction. Changing forestry activities 100.In addition to deregistering from the ETS or transferring interests to another person, participants can also apply to change their activity. 101.Under s 189 of the CCRA, a participant with an initial activity of standard forestry or permanent forestry can apply to become a participant in standard forestry o r per manent forestry. A change in activity carries over the unit balance from the initial activity to the final activity and a final emissions return needs to be submitted. Different liabilities arise depending on what the initial forestry activity was and wha t the new forestry activity will be. 102.However, there are restrictions in a change of activity if a person is registered for carrying out permanent forestry activities. The permanent forestry period is initially 50 years with an option to renew for a further 25 years (or further consecutive periods). This does not change if the land is transferred to another person. Examples of when a person can cease being registered for a permanent forest include: if the Minister of Climate Change approves; because of certain natural events; 16 o r if a transferee takes over that permanent forestry registration. 103.After the 50-year permanent forestry period ends, the person can extend the period for 25 years or can apply to be removed from the ETS or to transfer to standard forestry. On removal from the ETS or transfer to standard forestry, there are emissions liabilitie s t he forester must meet. 104.Emissions liabilities may also arise in other cases, for example if the type of trees grown changes (because different trees sequester carbon at different rates). This may occur if, for example, a permanent exotic forest is being transitioned into indigenous forests. 105.In these cases, there will be liabilities to surrender NZUs for emissions. As previously noted, under s CB 36, where NZUs are surrendered in relation to post-1989 forest land they are treated as being sold for zero. Changing accounting methods 106.While most foresters with post-1989 forest land currently use stock change accounting, the averaging accounting method applies to forests registered after 31 December 16 Section 182G of the CCRA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 38 2022. This carbon accounting method accounts for emissions and removals by reference to the expected long-term average level of carbon stock of the land over multiple rotations rather than by referring to short term changes in the actual carbon stock which is the method used in stock change accounting. 17 107.Prior to 30 June 2023, a participant using stock change accounting could opt into averaging accounting for carbon accounting areas where the first ETS registration ha d o ccurred after 1 January 2019. 18 These participants needed to file an emissions return s pecifying the emissions and removals during the period and calculating the liability or entitlement as if they had used averaging during the period. If the difference wa s po sitive the person received additional NZUs. If the difference was negative the person must surrender those NZUs. 108.Permanent forests that move into standard forestry are required to apply averaging a ccounting. 109.As with the above, there will be liabilities to surrender NZUs for emissions resulting from any change in carbon accounting treatment. As previously noted, under s CB 36, where NZUs are surrendered for emissions for post-1989 forest land they are treated as being sold for zero. Summary 110.The CCRA establishes the consequences for a forester deregistering from the ETS, transferring interests, swapping between categories, or changing accounting methods. In these cases, often a final emissions return is required with the CCRA specifyin g ca lculations for the amount of NZUs that may need to be surrendered (and in som e c ases any penalties). 111.In these cases, where NZUs are surrendered because of a change in activity, they ar e c lassed as an emissions liability for post-1989 forest land and this is deemed to occur for a value of zero under s CB 36. Whether the NZUs surrendered are forest land NZUs, replacement forest land NZUs or standard NZUs determines what deductions may be available and the timing of those deductions (as discussed earlier in this statement). Sales of forests – purchase price allocation rules 112.The purchase price allocation rules in ss GC 20 and GC 21 require parties to a sale an d pur chase of a forest along with other assets to adopt the same allocation of the purchase price to the various classes of assets sold. These rules do not apply if the sale 17 Section 191A of the CCRA. 18 Clause 33 of schedule 1AA of the CCRA. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 26 of 38 of the forest does not contain different classes of assets (for example if there was a sale of a forestry right with the only asset sold being standing timber). Summary of the purchase price allocation rules 113.Section GC 20 applies where the parties have agreed how the consideration will be a llocated. Section GC 21 applies where the parties have not agreed on allocation and a u nilateral allocation is made. 114.Sections GC 20(1) and GC 21(1) provide that the sections apply when, for consideration, a vendor disposes of items of property to a purchaser that fall into two or more classes of purchased property. Those classes are : ( i)trading stock, other than timber or a right to take timber (ii)timber or a right to take timber (iii)depreciable property, other than buildings (iv)buildings that are depreciable property (v)financial arrangements (vi)purchased property for which the disposal does not give rise to assessabl e inc ome for the vendor or deductions for the purchaser. 115.Under s GC 20, the parties agree and record the consideration allocated to each class of purchased property. This must occur before either party files a return in relation to the property. Each class of purchased property is treated as disposed of and acquire d f or the relevant allocated amount. 116.Section GC 21 applies where there has not been agreement before the relevant dates. The amounts are allocated as follows: The vendor may notify the purchaser and the Commissioner of the allocate d a mounts within 3 months of the change in ownership of the property. Th e a mounts allocated must be the greater of the relative market value of the class of property proportional to the other classes or property, or their tax book value for the relevant class of property. If the vendor does not notify the allocated amounts, the purchaser may notify the vendor and the Commissioner of the relevant allocated amounts within 6 months of the change of ownership of the property. An allocated amount must reflect the relative market value of the relevant class of purchased property proportional to the other classes of property. 117.Section GC 20(2) and s GC 21(7) provide that a class of purchased property is treated a s disposed of and acquired for the allocated amount. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 27 of 38 118.Under s GC 20(2)(b), the Commissioner may treat a class of property as disposed of and acquired for an amount that reflects the relative market value of the class of purchased property, proportional to the other classes of purchased property, if t he C ommissioner considers the allocated amount does not reflect that value. Interaction with s GC 1 119.The purchase price allocation rules operate to allocate the agreed purchase price bet ween the relevant classes of purchased property. The rules do not apply to substitute a new purchase price. 120.Section GC 1 applies to disposals of trading stock for less than market value and deems the vendor to have derived market value consideration. However, the sectio n a pplies only if the parties are associated, the trading stock is taken for the vendor’s own use, or the disposal of trading stock is not made in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving income. 121.Section GC 1(5) further provides that the section does not apply to a disposal of trading stock to which s GC 20(2) or s GC 21(7) apply. Therefore, when those sections apply, it is the allocations made under the purchase price allocation rules that are relevant and no further amounts of consideration need to be accounted for. 122.However, there are exclusions to this where the transaction occurs between associated persons. Section GC 20(2B) and s GC 21(11B) specifically provide that ss GC 20(2) and GC 21(7) do not apply where property in class (i) trading stock or in class (ii) timber or a right to take timber are sold: between associated persons; an d th e allocated amount for the class of purchased property is less than the total market value of the items of purchased property in the class of property at t he time of the disposal. 123.Therefore, a transaction between associated persons must allocate market value to all i tems of trading stock or timber or a right to take timber. If not, s GC 1 will apply to deem there to be market value consideration. Associated parties to a forestry transaction that is subject to the purchase price allocation rules should obtain a valuation to support their allocation of value to each class of purchased property. Meaning of trading stock 124.For the purposes of s GC 20 and GC 21, “trading stock” is defined in s YA 1 as including: anything acquired for the purposes of manufacture or disposal; IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 38 land whose disposal would produce income under any of sections CB 6A to CB 15 and CZ 39 (which relate to income from land); anything for which expenditure is incurred and would be trading stock if possession of it were taken. 125.NZUs are not ordinarily “trading stock”. They are explicitly excluded from being tr ading stock for the purposes of the trading stock rules in subpart EB. However, t he de finition of trading stock is broadened in some cases. 126.Section GC 3B provides that NZUs are treated as if they were trading stock for the purposes of s GC 1. This could imply that otherwise NZUs are not trading stock (gi ven t he exclusion in subpart EB). However, the definition in s YA 1 includes “anything acquired for the purposes of ... disposal”. In most cases, NZUs would be acquired by a forester for the purpose of disposal. The relevant purposes generally being for surrender for emissions liabilities or for sale on the market. 127.Therefore, generally, the parties to a sale and purchase of a forest need to agree an allocation of a purchase price between (where relevant): NZUs (trading stock in asset class (i)); timber or a right to take timber (asset class (ii)); and capital account land (asset class (iv)). NZUs acquired for surrender 128.Issues arise regarding the allocation of part of the purchase price to NZUs that are a cquired for surrender. The surrender obligation may only be a contingent liability at the time of sale. 129.Generally, a forest’s fair value would be reached by calculating the discounted future c ashflows from the forest. This could involve including the future NZU entitlements and the obligation to surrender NZUs on harvest (if applicable) in the value of the timber. If this valuation methodology is used, then the future obligation to surrender NZUs is accounted for in the value of the timber and cannot be used to value NZUs on hand as being nil. Those NZUs must be allocated market value. 130.However, it is not so clear how to account for NZUs when the valuation of the trees excludes any NZU entitlements and liabilities. A purchaser of a forest with NZUs may not want to pay anything to acquire NZUs that must soon be surrendered on harvest. This would factor into the agreed purchase price for the transaction. 131.Several different situations can apply in the context of the sale of a forest, generally depending on what the purchaser intends to do with the forest, including the following examples: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 38 If the purchaser acquires or plans to register a forest as a permanent forest, the o nly income generated from the forest is the NZUs. Whether any emissions liability exists depends on whether the trees will be cleared after the 50 years of being in the permanent forest regime. If the purchaser uses averaging accounting and the land remains forest land, there will be no emissions liability (at least until the time where the land becomes unviable for further rotations). If the purchaser uses averaging accounting and intends to deforest, then t he lia bility will arise on deforestation. If the purchaser uses stock change accounting, they will have a liability when they clear the forest. Where a forest is sold shortly before harvest, the surrender liabilities may be c onsidered to no longer be contingent (if the forest uses stock change carbo n a ccounting). If a future surrender liability is sufficiently certain to be an actual liability at the time of the purchase, for the purposes of s GC 20, the liability amount may be taken into account in the total amount of consideration payable for the forest. 132.There is no single correct answer to what an appropriate purchase price allocation may be for the sale of a forest because there are many variables. It is recommended tha t pa rties obtain tax advice when undertaking a purchase price allocation and that they have sufficient supporting evidence (such as valuations) to support their allocation of value to each class of purchased property. However, where the parties to a transaction are associated, they will need to allocate market value to purchased property that is timber, a right to take timber and trading stock (such as NZUs) under ss GC 20(2B), GC 21(11B) and GC 1. 133.Examples of what may be considered appropriate allocation methods of the purchase price in particular fact situations are set out below. For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions in these examples occur between arm’s length parties, and reflec t c ommercially negotiated terms. Standing timber is valued on a discounted cash flow basis and full market value is attributable to NZUs 134.One possible allocation method would have standing timber valued on a discounted cash flow basis and full market value attributable to NZUs. Under this method, the NZUs to be surrendered on harvest are included in the cost of harvest (ie, it would be accounted for as a reduction in the value of the timber when the value at harvest is being calculated). If so, it would not be appropriate to value the NZUs at nil because the cost of surrender is included in the value of the timber.   IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 38 Example | Tauira 5 – Emissions liabilities accounted in value of timber Flo’s Forestry Ltd was planning to increase its forestry interests and entered a series of sale and purchase agreements to buy forestry blocks. The first agreement was for the purchase of a standard forestry block from Timmy’s Trees Ltd for total cash consideration of $100. The forest was registered using stock change accounting and would be harvestable in 10 years’ time. The standing timber had been valued by a registered valuer, with reference to the emissions liability at harvest on a discounted basis. Flo’s Forestry Ltd and Timmy’s Trees Ltd agreed to a purchase price allocation of the $100 purchase price among the classes of purchased property as follows: class (i) trading stock (NZUs) 10 class (ii) timber 70 class (vi) capital account land 20 The NZUs must be attributed a market value because the value of the timber already takes into account the emissions liability at harvest. Timmy’s Trees Ltd will have income tax obligations for $80 on sale (timber and NZUs). Flo’s Forestry will be able to deduct the purchase price allocated to the timber ($70) and the NZUs ($10) at the time of disposal. Allocate nil value to NZUs to the extent that they need to be surrendered at harvest due to purchase price negotiations 135.Another allocation method that may be available in some situations may be to allocate nil value to NZUs to the extent that they need to be surrendered at harvest. This is where the purchaser is unwilling to pay for the NZUs that would be required for surrender, which are effectively offset by the future liability on the purchaser to surrender those NZUs. 136.This option may be available in some situations where, as part of the commercial negotiations, the purchaser is not willing to pay an amount for the NZUs required for surrender and this is reflected in the purchase price paid. The parties will need to be a ble to provide sufficient evidence supporting their allocations. This could includ e de tails of the negotiations, the valuations of the land and timber and may be supported by accounting treatment. In this situation, the purchase price amount would need to be consistent with the valuation of the timber and land excluding NZUs. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 38 Example | Tauira 6 – Imminent liability offset against NZU value Flo’s Forestry Ltd entered a second sale and purchase agreement with Timmy’s Trees Ltd to acquire a second standard forestry block for total cash consideration of $120 . This forestry block was also registered as a standard forest using stock change accounting. This forest was harvestable in 1 year’s time. Flo’s Forestry Ltd planned to harvest and then replant with indigenous species and register the forest in the permanent forestry regime. The valuer for this forest did not take into account ETS obligations when valuing the timber. Flo’s Forestry required the transfer of a sufficient number of NZUs for surrender as part of the negotiations, but was not prepared to pay anything for these NZUs. Flo’s Forestry Ltd and Timmy’s Trees Ltd agreed to a purchase price allocation of the $120 purchase price as follows: class (ii) timber 100 class (vi) capital account land 20 Timmy’s Trees Ltd will have income tax obligations of $100 for this sale (attributable to the timber). Flo’s Forestry Ltd will be able to deduct the same purchase price allocated to the timber at the time of disposal. Flo’s Forestry Ltd will not be able to deduct anything at the time of surrender of NZUs. Timmy’s Trees Ltd and Flo’s Forestry Ltd should keep records of their negotiations and the valuations to support their agreed allocation. 137.If there is no clear surrender obligation (for example for a permanent forest or a forest u sing averaging accounting) the market value of NZUs should always be taken into account. Similarly, for a forest using stock change accounting, NZUs should be a llocated value unless there is a clear surrender obligation and the amounts ar e r eflected in the negotiated purchase price, accounting treatment and in a valuation. Example | Tauira 7 – NZUs with no clear surrender obligation Flo’s Forestry Ltd and Timmy’s Trees Ltd entered a third sale and purchase agreement where Flo’s Forestry Ltd acquired a standard forest that uses averaging accounting for $150 . Flo’s Forestry Ltd planned to replant the forest after harvest for at least three rotations so would not have surrender liabilities. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 38 Due to there being no surrender obligation under averaging accounting, Flo’s Forestry Ltd is prepared to pay a higher purchase price and utilise the NZUs in repurchase arrangements. Flo’s Forestry Ltd and Timmy’s Trees Ltd agreed to a purchase price allocation as follows: class (i) trading stock (NZUs) 30 class (ii) timber 100 class (vi) capital account land 20 Timmy’s Trees Ltd will have income tax liabilities of $130 on the sale of timber and NZUs. Flo’s Forestry Ltd will be able to deduct the purchase price allocated to the timber ($100) and the NZUs ($30) at the time of disposal. 138.It can be seen from the above that there is no particular method that must be applied for allocating the purchase price among the assets in a sale of a forest. It is fact dependent. 139.The Commissioner generally accepts purchase price allocations that follow generally accepted industry treatment or valuation methodologies. However, it is acknowledge d th at in the forestry context there may not be generally accepted treatment. T he i mportant point is that both parties are consistently allocating the same amount to the same assets and that appropriate values are allocated between (for example) capital and revenue amounts. Note for submitters – we are particularly interested in hearing about how you apply the purchase price allocation rules to sales of forests, and any practical issues. For example, how do you apply the market value requirement for sales between associated persons? Repurchase arrangements involving NZUs and offtake arrangements 140.NZUs may be used in a variety of different arrangements and parties may structure these arrangements in different ways. This part of the statement provides general information on repurchase and offtake arrangements. 141.Due to the differing fact situations that exist, the Commissioner cannot provide general advice on these arrangements. Foresters who would like certainty on their ta x t reatment should seek advice and may wish to consider applying for a private ruling or IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 38 a short process ruling to confirm their tax treatment. For information on applying for a ruling, see: short-process-rulings. Repurchase arrangements 142.Some common transactions are NZU repurchase arrangements, which can occur through: a transfer of NZUs as a loan with the payment of a fee and repayment of NZUs in the future (a lending transaction), o r a sale with a specified buy-back in the future (a repurchase transaction). 143.In either situation, the initial transfer (whether this occurs as a sale or a loan) is treated as a disposal of the NZUs for tax purposes. 144.Section CB 36 provides that amounts derived from the disposal of emissions units are income. The ordinary meaning of “disposal” means to get rid of something. The Hig h C ourt of Australia in McGain v FCT (1966) 14 ATD 190 held that a loan of cash involves the disposal of property. The court said that gifts, loans and sales all involve a disposition. This decision was approved by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Rossiter v CIR (1976) 2 NZTC 61,197. 145.In the context of share lending, in an Australian case (Lift Capital Partners Pty Ltd v Merrill Lynch International (2009) 253 ALR 482 (NSWSC)) it was similarly said: \[84\] The concept here is that one person “disposes” of securities to another person and later either “re-acquires” those securities from that other person or “acquires” identica l securities from that other person. In either case, there is an initial transfer of ownership by the “lender” to the “borrower” and a subsequent transfer of ownership (of either the same or identical securities) by the “borrower” to the “lender”. ... 146.Therefore, with either a lending or repurchase transaction involving NZUs, there is a disposal and then a subsequent reacquisition of NZUs. The share lending rules in t he I TA 2007 do not apply to treat the sale and repurchase as a loan, because NZUs are not share s. P re-1990 forest land NZUs 147.Specific rules apply to transactions involving pre-1990 forest land NZUs but these rules are restricted to only those types of NZUs. 148.Section EW 5(11C) provides that an arrangement is an excepted financial arrangement that is subject to s EW 52 where it involves the use of pre-1990 NZUs as security for a lending arrangement. T hat is, as part of a financial arrangement that is a loan to the holder by the other person, there is: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 38 the assignment of a pre-1990 forest land NZU by the holder to a non-associated per son, and; the later assignment of an NZU back to the original holder by that other person. 149.Section EW 52B provides that the holder is treated as continuing to hold a pre-1990 forest land NZU during the arrangement. The returned NZU is treated as being t he o riginal pre-1990 forest land NZU and its cost is treated as the cost of the original NZU. This provision overrides subpart ED in respect of allocating values to the NZUs. However, the rules require a timely return of the NZU to the holder and a failure to do so will result in these rules not applying. 150.The effect of these provisions is that where a person lends pre-1990 forest land NZUs as security, no income tax consequences arise from any disposals and reacquisitions of those NZUs. The original holder is treated as remaining the holder of a pre-1990 forest land NZU (and it does not lose that status when NZUs are returned to the holder). 151.Any fees payable to the holder for the transaction are taxable income under ordinary principles (s CA 1(2)). Other types of NZUs 152.There are no rules similar to s EW 52B that apply to other types of NZUs. Any amounts received for the disposal are taxable under s CB 36. If no amounts are received for the disposal, s GC 1 may apply to deem a market value amount to be derived, unless t he ex ception applies where the transaction occurs in the course of carrying on a business and the parties are not associated. 153.Any fees payable to the person lending the NZUs are income to the lender under s CA 1(2) when derived. T hese amounts are not “interest” for tax purposes because they ar e n ot paid for money lent. The disposal of the NZUs also crystallises any deduction available to the lender (although if the NZUs lent were forest land NZUs then t he a vailable deduction is zero). 154.Importantly, the disposal of NZUs under such an arrangement will mean that, on receiving equivalent NZUs back in the future, they will not be classed as “post-1989 forest land emissions units”. The NZUs lose their status, which may have ta x c onsequences. 155.The other party to the transaction (the borrower) will be entitled to an upfront deduction for the cost of acquiring the NZUs under the arrangement to the extent tha t a n amount is paid for the NZUs and to the extent that the NZUs are a replacement forest land NZU for that person (that is, they are acquired for surrender for a n e missions liability as a replacement for a forest land NZU. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 35 of 38 156.In summary, foresters who enter NZU repurchase arrangements need to carefully consider the consequences of such arrangements. The consequences depend on t he p articular contractual terms the parties have entered into. Most relevantly, the NZUs will lose their status as post-1989 forest land NZUs which may have tax consequences. 157.Any amounts paid under the arrangement to acquire NZUs are taxable to the recipient and deductible to the payer (the timing of deductions depend on the type of emissions units being purchased). 158.For completeness, because NZUs are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(3B), the financial arrangements rules do not apply to any gains or losses resulting from the change in value of the NZUs over the period of an NZU repurchas e a rrangement that are solely attributable to the NZUs. This would also turn on the terms of the contractual arrangements. 159.The following example illustrates the above concepts. How the tax rules apply to any particular arrangement depends on the particular facts and contractual terms the parties enter into. Due to the differing fact situations that may exist, the Commissioner cannot provide general advice on how the tax laws apply to these arrangements. Example | Tauira 8 – Sale and repurchase of NZUs Ray’s Radiatas Ltd from Example | Tauira 3 needed NZUs for surrender in May 2024. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd expected to earn NZUs in the future from a younger forestry block. Flo’s Forestry Ltd had excess NZUs available and agreed to provide these to Ray’s Radiatas Ltd under a sale and repurchase agreement. In April 2024, Flo’s Forestry Ltd agreed to provide Ray’s Radiatas Ltd 500 NZUs in return for Ray’s Radiatas Ltd providing 500 NZUs in 3 years’ time. Ray’s Radiatas Ltd paid a fee for the use of the NZUs. Any gain or loss attributable to the value of the NZUs is solely attributable to the NZUs and is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. The fee is taxable income. Depending on how the arrangement is structured the fee may be income from a financial arrangement, or may be subject to ordinary principles. The lending arrangement was a deal between non-associated parties made in the course of carrying on their respective businesses. Therefore, s GC 1 does not apply. NZU off-take arrangements 160.Foresters may also undertake NZU off-take arrangements. An off-take arrangement involves a person who requires NZUs for surrender agreeing with a forester to acquire a certain amount of NZUs at a particular time for a payment. These agreements coul d IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 36 of 38 be structured in different ways, for instance this could involve a forester agreeing to provide NZUs as they are earned, or a certain amount per year, or in lump sums at certain times. 161.The tax treatment of these arrangements depends on the particular facts. The financial arrangements rules may apply (although any changes in value of the NZUs is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement). There may be issues with t he t iming of derivation of income, depending on the relationship between wh en pa yments are made and when NZUs are provided. 162.This statement cannot provide general guidance on these arrangements because the t ax consequences depend on how the deals are structured. Foresters undertaking these arrangements should seek advice about the tax consequences. GST consequences 163.GST obligations for supplies of NZUs made by a GST registered person are reasonably settled. NZUs are services and not goods for GST purposes. Supplies of NZUs ar e s ubject to GST. However, most supplies of NZUs are zero-rated for GST purposes under s 11A(1)(s) – (w) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GSTA). 164.Section 11A of the GSTA zero rates: the transfer of NZUs (other than certain transfers by the Crown that are no t r elevant in the forestry context); the surrender of NZUs under s 63 of the CCRA (ie, for emissions); the supply of services to or by the Crown in consideration for which there is no payment of a price and that is zero rated above; and a disposal of similar types of units that are issued by reference to t he s equestration or avoidance of emission, of human-induced greenhouse gases and verified to an internationally recognised standard. 165.Therefore, the transfer or surrender of NZUs is zero rated for GST purposes. This means the relevant supplies are subject to GST but at a rate of 0%.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, interpretation statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s Statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an interpretation statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.

IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 2 of 7 Summary | Whakarāpopoto 1. If you sell a residential property you have owned for less than two years, you may have to pay income tax on any gain on the sale, unless an exclusion or rollover relief applies. This is called the bright-line test. 2. A look-through company (LTC) is a normal company that for income tax purposes is treated as transparent (like a partnership). Transparency is achieved by attributing the activities and other characteristics of the LTC to the LTC owners. Transparency results in the LTC owners being treated as deriving income and having other amounts (for example, deductions and tax credits) that would otherwise be derived or had by the LTC. An LTC owner is treated as:  carrying on the activities and having the status, intentions and purposes of the look-through company;  holding the property of the LTC (in proportion to the LTC owner’s interest in the LTC);  being a party to any arrangement to which the LTC is a party (in proportion to the LTC owner’s interest in the LTC); and  doing a thing or being entitled to anything the LTC does or is entitled to (in proportion to the LTC owner’s interest in the LTC). 3. Because of the above treatment (particularly the holding of property), questions arise as to how the bright-line test applies in the following situations, where:  a person or persons transfer an interest in residential land to an LTC of which they are LTC owners;  an LTC transfers an interest in residential land to one or more LTC owners in their separate capacities;  a company that owns residential land becomes an LTC;  a company that owns residential land ceases to be an LTC; and  an LTC owner disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC that owns residential land, for example by selling shares in the LTC. 4. For these situations, the interpretation statement provides guidance on:  whether there is a disposal of residential land;  whether the main home exclusion applies; and IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 3 of 7  whether rollover relief under s FD 1 applies (including rollover relief relating to the value of the transfer, the bright-line start date and the attribution of the transferor’s use of land). 5. For the fifth situation, the application of the safe harbour test in s HB 5 is also discussed. 6. The interpretation statement explains the tax treatment in more detail, but the explanations are summarised in the following table | tūtohi. Where a person (in their separate capacity) transfers residential land to an LTC of which they are an LTC owner Disposal of land? Yes Rollover relief will apply if the LTC and the LTC owner were associated at the date of transfer and for the previous two years (normally, the LTC will be new, in which case rollover relief will not be available) Tax treatment Does rollover relief apply?

No Rollover relief? No (because there is no disposal), but a similar result follows from ss HB 13(6) and HB 1 IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 5 of 7 Tax treatment Cost base for LTC owner Bright-line start date for LTC owner Company's use of land attributed to LTC owner?

Yes, under s HB 4(6) Rollover relief? No, because the disposal is to a notional third party (s HB 4(6)), not an associated person Tax treatment Value of transfer Bright-line start date for transferee Transferor's use of land attributed to transferee? Market value (s HB 4(6)) Date of cessation No IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 6 of 7 Where an LTC owner (exiting owner) disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC that owns residential land to an associated person (entering owner) Disposal of land? Yes Safe harbour rule could apply if the amount paid for the shares is close to the gross tax value of the LTC’s assets less liabilities as measured by s HB 5(1) Rollover relief could apply if exiting and entering owners were associated at the date of transfer and for the previous two years, or if the transfer is to a trustee in circumstances described in s FD 1(1)(b) Tax treatment Does the safe harbour rule or rollover relief apply? Value of transfer Bright-line start date for transferee Transferor's use of land attributed to transferee? Safe harbour rule applies Disposal payment is excluded income to the exiting owner and the entering owner has exiting owner’s cost (s HB 5) Exiting owner’s bright- line start date Yes, as a result of the safe harbour rule in s HB 5. Safe harbour does not apply, but rollover relief applies Exiting owner’s cost (s FD 1(2)) Exiting owner’s bright- line start date (s FD 1(3)) Yes (s FD 1(4)) Neither applies Actual consideration for transfer, or market value if s GC 1 applies Determined under s CB 6A(2) No IS XX/XX FS X | Issue date Page 7 of 7 About this document | Mō tēnei tuhinga Some of the Tax Counsel Office’s longer or more complex items are accompanied by a fact sheet that summarises and explains an item’s main points.

This can vary, but it is usually the date the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the residential land. Bright-line period is the period beginning with the bright-line start date for the land and ending with the bright-line end date for the land. Bright-line start date is the date that the bright-line period starts. This can also vary, but it will often be date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered under the Land Transfer Act 2017. This is not necessarily the same as the date that the land is acquired. This can also be modified for a person by the rollover relief provisions. Capacity is about how a person is recognised for tax purposes. In some cases, a person can have more than one capacity. A person who holds property as a look-through company (LTC) owner is treated as having certain characteristics of the LTC, but only in their capacity as an LTC owner. An LTC owner’s characteristics from their separate capacity can also be relevant in determining their liabilities with respect to the activities of the LTC. Excluded income is an amount of income that is not included in a person’s assessable income. LTC owner is a term used generally to describe a person who has a look-through interest for the look-through company. This means they own shares in the LTC. Rollover relief is a term used generally to describe various kinds of relief that may be available under the bright-line rules where there is a disposal of residential land. Despite being referred to as “relief”, it will not always be favourable. One form of rollover relief is the treatment of a transfer as being made at cost (for both the transferor and the transferee), which prevents any profit or loss on the transfer. Another form of rollover relief allows a person who acquires residential land to have the same bright-line start date as the person who transferred the land to them. Finally, a transferor’s use of the residential land (including use as a main home) can be attributed to a transferee. Transfer is used in the bright-line rules in a general sense. The word transfer does not necessarily mean the registration of an instrument to transfer the land under the Land Transfer Act 2017. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 4 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction | Whakataki 1. A look-through company (LTC) is a company that is treated as being transparent for most income tax purposes under the ITA 2007. Among other things, transparency means that LTC owners are treated as holding property that the company holds. Transparency results in LTC owners, rather than the LTC, deriving income from a transaction involving LTC property. This includes income under the bright-line test in s CB 6A. 2. The directors of a company can elect for a company to be an LTC if eligibility requirements are met. One of the requirements is that company must have five or fewer “look-through counted owners”. LTCs are sometimes used by families or other small groups of people to hold residential land. 3. The bright-line test in s CB 6A applies to an amount derived by a person from the disposal of residential land if the land is disposed of within two years of the person’s “bright-line start date” for the land. 1 However, the bright-line test will not apply if the main home exclusion in s CB 16A applies. Further, rollover relief under subpart FD may apply in some circumstances. Relief may also be provided by the LTC safe harbour rule in s HB 5 where an LTC owner transfers shares in an LTC. 4. This interpretation statement discusses five situations involving LTCs, and for each situation provides guidance on:  whether there is a disposal of residential land;  whether the main home exclusion applies; and  whether rollover relief under s FD 1 applies (including rollover relief relating to the value of the transfer, the bright-line start date and the attribution of the transferor’s use of land). 5. For the fifth situation, the application of the safe harbour test in s HB 5 is also discussed. 1 An amount derived from disposing of residential land outside of the 2-year period may be subject to tax under another taxing provision, for example, s CB 6 (Disposal: land acquired for purpose or with intention of disposal). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 5 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 6. The five situations involving LTCs are as follows:  A person or persons transfer an interest in residential land to an LTC of which they are LTC owners.  An LTC transfers an interest in residential land to one or more LTC owners in their separate capacities.  A company that owns residential land becomes an LTC.  An LTC that owns residential land ceases to be an LTC. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 6 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  An LTC owner disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC that owns residential land, for example by selling some of their shares in the LTC. 7. Table | Tūtohi 1 summarises the guidance for the situations in \[ 6\]. 8. This interpretation statement also briefly discusses some miscellaneous transfers including transfers of residential land following death of a person, transfers of residential land from a trustee of a trust to an LTC, and transfers of residential land from a company to an LTC.

This section considers the situation where one or more persons transfer an interest in residential land to an LTC they own shares in. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 9 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether there is a disposal 10. For the bright-line test in s CB 6A to apply, there must be a disposal of residential land. 11. The Commissioner considers there is a disposal of residential land in this situation. 12. The ordinary meaning of “dispose” applies in this context. 2 Under the ordinary meaning, a disposal of property involves the total alienation of the property. 3 A disposal also includes acts by which some new interest in property is created and vested in another person. The new interest can be a legal or an equitable interest. 4 13. For a more detailed discussion of the ordinary meaning of “dispose”, see IS 22/03: Income tax – Application of the land sale rules to co-ownership changes and changes of trustees 5 from \[35\]. 14. In determining whether there is a disposal when a person transfers an interest in land to an LTC, it is relevant to ask whether the property that they have before and after the transfer is the same. If they have a different interest in property after the transfer, then they may have disposed of their original interest in property and replaced it with a new interest in property. 15. Therefore, it is relevant to consider the nature of an LTC owner’s interest in property that the LTC owns and to compare this with the interest in property that a person has where they hold property directly. 16. The nature of an LTC owner’s interest in property has two dimensions:  the nature of the interests LTC owners have for non-tax law purposes; and  the effect of s HB 1 (LTCs are transparent). 2 “Dispose” is defined in the Act for the purposes of s CB 6A, but the definition is an inclusive one, such that it extends the meaning of the word, rather than providing a general meaning. 3 Henty House Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 88 CLR 141 (HCA); FCT v Cooling 90 ATC 4,472 (FC). 4 Carter v Carter \[1896\] 1 Ch 62; Case Q57 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,325. 5 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 34, No 7 (August 2022). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 10 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] For non-tax law purposes 17. For non-tax purposes, an LTC owner does not own land that the LTC owns. An LTC is a normal company – an entity that is separate from its owners. An LTC owner is merely a shareholder of the company. A company's assets do not belong to the shareholders. Shareholders are not entitled to anything except for the ownership interest given by their shares. These ownership interests might include the right to a share on the distribution of the surplus assets of the company if it is liquidated or wound up. Howe ver, this interest is quite different from an interest that a person holds where they own land directly. 18. Therefore, for non-tax purposes, when a person transfers land to an LTC there is a total alienation of the interest in land that they held before the transfer and, therefore, there is a disposal of the land. The effect of s HB 1 (LTCs are transparent) 19. It might be argued that the transparent tax treatment under s HB 1 prevents the existence of a disposal on the basis that an LTC owner owns, or is treated by s HB 1 as owning, the property before and after the transfer. 20. The Commissioner’s view is that transparency under s HB 1 does not apply to this situation, so transparency does not prevent the existence of a disposal. 21. Under s HB 1, LTCs are treated as being transparent for some income tax purposes. Section HB 1 relevantly states: IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 11 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] HB 1 Look-through companies are transparent When this section applies (1) This section applies for the purposes of this Act, other than the PAYE rules, the FBT rules, the NRWT rules, the RWT rules, the ESCT rules, and the RSCT rules, for a person in their capacity of owner of an effective look-through interest for a look-through company (the LTC), for an income year, ... ... Look-through for effective look-through interest (4) For a person, unless the context requires otherwise,— (a) the person is treated as carrying on an activity carried on by the LTC, and having a status, intention, and purpose of the LTC, and the LTC is treated as not carrying on the activity or having the status, intention, or purpose: (b) the person is treated as holding property that the LTC holds, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not holding the property: (c) the person is treated as being party to an arrangement to which the LTC is a party, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not being a party to the arrangement: (d) the person is treated as doing a thing and being entitled to a thing that the LTC does or is entitled to, in proportion to the person’s effective look-through interest, and the LTC is treated as not doing the thing or being entitled to the thing. \[Emphasis added\] 22. Among other things, s HB 1 treats a person who is an LTC owner as holding property that the LTC holds and as doing a thing the LTC does. Also, it treats the LTC as not holding the property or doing the thing. 23. If s HB 1 applied in this situation (where persons transfer land to an LTC they own, and their ownership proportions do not change), it might be argued that there is no disposal of the land on the basis that a person would be treated as holding the same interest in land before and after the disposal, first in their separate capacity and then in their capacity as LTC owner. 24. However, s HB 1 does not apply in all cases. First, it applies for a person only if they are an LTC owner and only in their capacity as an LTC owner. Second, it does not apply if the context requires otherwise. Section HB 1 is also a deeming provision that creates statutory fictions. In interpreting a deeming provision that creates a statutory fiction, it IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 12 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] is necessary to understand the purpose of the provision. The fiction is then only taken as far as is necessary to achieve the purpose of the provision, and no further. 6 25. Because of these limits to its application, s HB 1 does not apply in a scenario where a section (such as s CB 6A) is being applied to a person who is not an LTC owner or who is not acting in their capacity as an LTC owner. This is the case even if an LTC is the other party to a transaction to which the section is being applied. 26. When a person transfers an interest in land to an LTC, the person (who are potentially the subject of s CB 6A) is not acting in their capacity as an LTC owner – they are acting in their separate capacity. Therefore, in any consideration of whether there is a disposal giving rise to income under s CB 6A for the person, s HB 1 does not apply. Because s HB 1 does not apply, the LTC is not treated as transparent for the purposes of the transfer, so the LTC owner is not treated as acquiring or holding the land in this context. As a result, under s HB 1, the land is not treated as owned by the same persons before and after the transfer. Therefore, s HB 1 does not invite a conclusion that there is no disposal. The transfer is simply a transfer from persons to a company, so is a disposal by the persons. 27. This interpretation of s HB 1 is consistent with the interpretation of the similar provision, s HG 2 (partnerships are transparent), in QB 17/09: Is there a full or partial disposal when an asset is contributed to a partnership as a capital contribution? 7 28. Further, the Commissioner considers that to apply the statutory fictions in s HB 1 in this situation would be going further than is necessary to achieve the purpose of s HB 1. The general purpose of s HB 1 is to provide transparent income tax treatment for electing closely held companies. 8 This is reflected in the heading of s HB 1(4): “Look- through for effective look-through interest”. The commentary also refers to look- through income tax treatment. 9 The main goals of the look-through income tax treatment are to pass income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses through to owners and to tax the owners at the level of the owners. 29. The situation considered here involves a transaction between an LTC and an owner of the LTC. It involves a transition from holding property directly to using an entity to hold property – it is not a situation concerning the look-through treatment of income 6 Re Levy , ex parte Walton (1881) 17 Ch D 746 at 756; \[1881 – 85\] All ER Rep 548. This principle, as expressed in Re Levy, has been approved in New Zealand in Tobin v Dorman \[1937\] NZLR 937 (HC) at 942 and Picton Borough v Marlin Motels (1971) Ltd \[1975\] 1 NZLR 65 (HC) at 70 The principle is also discussed in Burrows and Carter Statute Law in New Zealand (6 th ed, LexisNexis, Wellington, 2021) at 451 and in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation (7th ed, LexisNexis, London, 2017) at 850. 7 Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 1 (February 2018) at 10. 8 New look-through company rules (special report, Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, 23 December 2010) at 1. 9 New look-through company rules. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 13 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] and other amounts. There is no indication of any intention that the income tax treatments s HB 1 provides for were to apply to a context such as this. This is a further reason for concluding that there is a disposal when a person transfers an interest in land to an LTC. 30. The view that there is a disposal is also consistent with the former sections s CB 6AB and ss FC 9B and FC 9C. These sections assumed the existence of a disposal where persons transfer residential land to themselves in different capacities. Section CB 6AB and ss FC 9B and FC 9C have now been repealed, but as legislative history they still provide some support for the view that there is a disposal. Whether the main home exclusion applies 31. If the disposal is made within two years of the person’s bright-line start date, the bright-line test in s CB 6A could apply to the transfer. 32. However, the bright-line test in s CB 6A does not apply if the main home exclusion in s CB 16A applies. Used predominantly, for most of the bright-line period 33. For the main home exclusion to apply to a disposal of residential land by a person, the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the bright-line period, for a dwelling that was the main home of the person. 10 34. Land is used “predominantly” for the person’s main home if more than 50% of the area of the land has been used for the home. The test is based on a person’s actual use of the property, not the person’s intended use. 35. The person must also use the land as their main home for most of the bright-line period. This requires the person to use the land as their main home for more than 50% of the bright-line period. However, the person does not need to have used the land as their main home without interruption. 36. The “bright-line period” is the period beginning with the bright-line start date for the land and ending with the bright-line end date for the land. This period can be modified by the rollover relief provisions (discussed from \[38\]) . This means the bright- line period can pre-date the period the land is held in the LTC. In the situation considered in this section, the bright-line period for the LTC owners may be a period beginning with the bright-line start date of the transferor in their non-LTC capacity before the land was transferred to the LTC. If so, the use of the land for this extended period must be considered. 10 Or the main home of a beneficiary of a trust if the requirements of section CB 16A(1)(b) are satisfied. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 14 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 37. The main home exclusion is discussed further at \[63\] in relation to the rollover relief provided by s FD 1(4). This rollover relief can affect whether the main home exclusion is available to a transferee if the transferee subsequently disposes of the land. Whether rollover relief applies 38. If the bright-line test does apply, the next question is whether rollover relief under s FD 1 applies. There are different types of rollover relief, including relief relating to the value of the transfer, the bright-line start date and the attribution of the use of land. The different types of rollover relief are discussed from \[55\], b ut the requirements for the application of rollover relief are discussed first. 39. There are two alternative tests for the application of rollover relief under s FD 1:  Under the first test in s FD 1(1)(a), rollover relief applies if residential land is transferred within the bright-line period between persons associated under any of ss YB 2 to YB 13 at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. 11  The second test in s FD 1(1)(b) involves a transfer to a trustee of a trust. This test is not relevant in the situation considered in this section, wh ich involves a transfer to an LTC. Association between an LTC and an LTC owner 40. Rollover relief under s FD 1(1)(a) applies to transfers between persons associated under any of sections YB 2 to YB 13 at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. 12 41. For the purposes of the association requirement in s FD 1(1)(a), s HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent) is ignored. Section HB 1 provides for the transparent tax treatment of LTCs and applies unless the context requires otherwise. In this case, the context of s FD 1(1)(a) requires otherwise. This is because s FD 1(1)(a) is intentionally using the associated person rules to describe relationships, including the relationship between an LTC and an LTC owner. Transparency would be counterproductive in this context. This is supported by the commentary to the amendment paper released when s FD 1 was introduced. 13 Ignoring transparency in this context means that where there is a transfer of residential land between a person and an LTC in which they own shares, 11 Rollover relief can also apply in a case where residential land is transferred to a trustee, but this is not applicable in the context of this situation. 12 Sections YB 2 to YB 13 contain all the associated person rules in subpart YB, except the tripartite relationship rule contained in s YB 14. 13 Commentary for Amendment Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2023–24, Multinational Tax, and Remedial Matters) Bill (Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue, March 2024) a t 19. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 15 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the land is treated as being transferred between the person and the LTC, not the person and themselves in different capacities. 42. For this LTC situation, the relevant associated person test is s YB 13 (Look-through companies and owners of interests). 43. Under s YB 13, an LTC and an LTC owner are associated if:  the LTC owner is a director or employee for the LTC; or  the LTC owner has effective look-through interests of 25% or more in a right, obligation, or other property status, or thing of the LTC. 44. An aggregation rule (in s YB 13(3)) applies for the purposes of determining whether a person has effective look-through interests of 25% or more. This rule treats a person (person A) as holding anything held by another person (person B), if persons A and B are associated under any of ss YB 2 to YB 11 and YB 14. 45. Example | Tauira 1 provides a simple example of rollover relief applying based on association between an LTC and an LTC owner. Example | Tauira 1 – Rollover relief based on association between LTC and LTC owner Facts On 24 June 2023, a married couple, persons 1 and 2, acquired residential land as a holiday home. On 1 August 2024, persons 1 and 2 transferred the residential land to an LTC, wholly owned by person 1 since 1 April 2020. At the time of transfer, the LTC was dormant and had no property. At the time of transfer, shares were issued to person 2 to give person 1 and 2 equal shares in the LTC. Persons 1 and 2 have been married since 14 February 2022. Bright-line test applies The transfer of the land to the LTC on 1 August 2024 is within two years of person 1 and 2’s bright-line start date for the land of 24 June 2023, and the main home exclusion does not apply. Therefore, the bright-line test applies to the amounts derived by persons 1 and 2 from the transfer of the land. Rollover relief applies However, rollover relief applies for both persons 1 and 2. Person 1 and the LTC were associated at the date of transfer and for the two years before that date. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 16 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Person 2 was also associated with the LTC at the date of transfer and for the two years before that date. Under the aggregation rule in s YB 13(3), person 2 is treated as having held person 1’s effective look-through interests in the LTC from 14 February 2022 (when they married person 1). 46. Rollover relief under s FD 1(1)(a) applies if the transfer is between persons associated at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. The 2-year period before the date of transfer would, for example, include 1 July 2022 if the date of transfer was 1 July 2024. 47. An effective look-through interest can in some cases be calculated based on average daily look-through interests during an income year. If so, in the context of s FD 1, this means that for each income year that falls within the two-year period (there will usually be three such income years), the average daily interest must be 25% or more. This means that the look-through interest could be lower than 25% at times during the income years (but not zero because the person must be an LTC owner at all times during the two-year period). Rollover relief not available for transfer to newly incorporated company 48. The requirement to be associated for two years before the transfer date means that rollover will not be available in the scenario where a person owning residential land in their own name wishes to transfer the land into a newly incorporated company that they own. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 2. Example | Tauira 2 – Rollover relief not available for transfer to new company In August 2024, persons 1 and 2 purchase a house together as a residential rental property. The purchase price is $1 million. The instrument to transfer the land to persons 1 and 2 is registered on 20 August 2024. On 18 September 2025, they ask their lawyer about transferring the property to an LTC (which they would incorporate and elect to be an LTC). By this date the value of the property has increased to $1.1 million. Their lawyer advises them to wait, if possible, until 20 August 2026 to transfer the property to an LTC so that the bright-line test will not apply to the transfer. Their lawyer advises them that if they transfer the property to the LTC before 20 August 2026 they could be subject to the bright-line test. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 17 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Rollover relief is not dependent on the bright-line test applying to the transferor 49. Rollover relief under s FD 1 applies for a transfer regardless of whether the bright-line test in s CB 6A applies to the transferor. 50. Section FD 1 applies when residential land is “transferred within the bright-line period”. This might be interpreted as meaning that rollover relief will apply only if the bright- line test in s CB 6A applies to a transfer. However, this is not the case. 51. The Commissioner considers that the words “within the bright-line period” in s FD 1(1) do not add anything to the legislative test. “Bright-line period" is defined as the period beginning with the bright-line start date and ending with the bright-line end date – a period without any fixed length. 14 Further, the term “transferred” in the phrase “transferred within the bright-line period” is used in a general sense to refer to the disposal that is the subject of s CB 6A. “Transfer” does not necessarily refer to the registration of an instrument to transfer land under the Land Transfer Act 2017. It follows that the requirement for the land to be “transferred within the bright-line period” will always be satisfied for a transfer because the bright-line period ends with the bright-line end date, which will be the same as the date of transfer (being the date of disposal). 52. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 3. Example | Tauira 3 – Rollover relief applies for a transfer regardless of whether the bright-line test applies to the transferor On 16 April 2024, person 1 purchases residential land for $1 million. Three years later, on 16 April 2027, person 1 transfers the land to an LTC that they have own ed for several years for the market value of $1.1 million. The LTC holds the land for one year and then, on 16 April 2028, transfers it to a third party for $1.2 million. Transfer to the LTC The bright-line test does not apply to the disposal of the land to the LTC because the disposal is not within two years of person 1’s bright-line start date for the land. Nevertheless, rollover relief applies to the transfer. This has no impact on person 1 as transferor because they are not taxed on the transfer. However, person 1 as transferee and in their capacity as LTC owner, is treated as acquiring the residential land at the 14 Section YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 18 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] transferor’s cost ($1 million) and with the transferor’s bright-line start date (16 April 2024). Transfer to the third party The transfer to the third party on 16 April 2028 is treated, by virtue of s HB 1, as a transfer of an interest in the land by person 1 in their capacity as LTC owner. The land is not transferred within two years of the bright-line start date of 16 April 2024, so the transfer is not subject to the bright-line test. Two-year stand down period for subsequent use of rollover relief 53. Rollover relief under s FD 1 does not apply to a transfer (a second transfer) of residential land if the section has already been applied to a transfer (the first transfer) and two years have not passed from the date of the first transfer. 15 54. For example, in Example | Tauira 3, if instead of transferring the residential land to the third party, the LTC transferred the land back to person 1 (second transfer), rollover relief would not apply because only one year had passed since person 1 transferred the land to the LTC (first transfer). Rollover relief Rollover “relief” is not necessarily favourable 55. Although it is referred to as rollover “relief”, and often will prevent tax applying to a disposal of land, the rollover relief provided by s FD 1 is not necessarily favourable in all situations. For example, in some cases s FD 1 could prevent a person from realising a loss on a disposal or prevent a person from using the main home exclusion (this is illustrated in Example | Tauira 9). Whether it is favourable or not, the rollover relief treatment applies automatically and there is no requirement to opt in or ability to opt out. 56. Where the requirements for rollover relief are met, the following rollover relief treatment applies. Rollover relief applies to all LTC owners 57. Where a person or persons transfer residential land to an LTC and the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied (eg, if the person or persons have been associated with the 15 Section FD 1(5). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 19 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] LTC for the required 2-year period), rollover relief will apply to all LTC owners, not just the LTC owner or owners who transferred the land to the LTC. Disposal amount 58. The transferor (in this situation, the person in their non-LTC owner capacity) is treated under s FD 1(2) as transferring the residential land for an amount that equals the cost of the land to the transferor. This means that they will not have any profit or loss from the disposal. Acquisition cost 59. Also under s FD 1(2), a transfer is treated as an acquisition by the transferee for an amount that equals the cost of the land to the transferor. 60. In the situation considered here, the transferor is the person in their non-LTC owner capacity. T he transferees are the LTC owners (including the transferor in their LTC owner capacity). 61. Each transferee will have a share of the total cost of the land to the transferor determined by the transferees’ effective look-through interests. Bright-line start date 62. Under s FD 1(3), rollover relief is provided to a transferee in relation to their bright-line start date for an interest in land. The transferee is treated as having the same bright- line start date for an interest in land as the transferor. In other words, the bright-line start date for the interest in land will not reset. Transferor’s use of land attributed to transferee 63. Under s FD 1(4), the transferor’s use of the land (and the periods of time in which it is so used) is attributed to the transferee. This is relevant to whether the transferee can satisfy the requirements of the main home exclusion if they subsequently dispose of the land within two years of their bright-line start date. The main home exclusion is discussed at \[33\]. 64. Section FD 1(4) is relevant to the main home exclusion because for the main home exclusion to apply to a disposal of residential land by a person, the land must have been used predominantly, “for most of the bright-line period”, for a dwelling that was the main home. The attribution of the transferor’s use of the land to the transferee under s FD 1(4) can determine whether residential land has been used by the transferee as a main home “for most of the bright-line period”. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 20 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 65. An example of attribution of use is provided at \[111\] in the context of the next situation considered in this statement (where attribution is more likely to be relevant). 66. In the situation considered in this section, the transferees are the LTC owners. As discussed next, an LTC owner can satisfy the requirements, and receive the benefit, of the main home exclusion (which will be relevant if they subsequently dispose of the land within two years of their bright line start date). Main home exclusion can apply to LTC owners 67. If an LTC owner subsequently disposes of their interest in land, the question may arise as to whether they can use the main home exclusion. 68. An LTC owner can satisfy the requirements, and receive the benefit, of the main home exclusion. Section HB 1 treats an LTC owner as holding property that the LTC holds in proportion to the LTC owner’s interest in the LTC. As a result, the LTC owner is the person who is subject to tax under s CB 6A and the person to whom the main home exclusion in s CB 16A could potentially apply. Section HB 1 also enables the LTC owner to satisfy the main home exclusion requirement that the residential land is the main home for the LTC owner. 16 69. It might be argued that a person lives in a main home in their personal capacity, not in their capacity as an LTC owner. From this, it might be argued that an assessment of the person for tax in their capacity as an LTC owner should not take into account the fact that they live in the main home. However, the transparent tax treatment of an LTC does not mean the characteristics of an LTC owner in their separate capacity are ignored. Section HB 1 treats the LTC owner as having certain characteristics that the LTC has; it does not take away separate characteristics of the LTC owner, such as the fact that they use residential land as a main home. An LTC owner is not taxed as two entirely separate people. Further, the purposes for which a person holds residential land in their capacity as an LTC owner and their use of the land in their separate capacity can be consistent. There is not necessarily any issue with using an LTC to hold residential land that the LTC owners are using as a dwelling (provided deductions are not claimed for expenditure that has no nexus with the derivation of income or that is of a private or domestic nature). For example, a company is not required to be carrying on a business or other income earning activity in order to be a look-through company. 70. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 4. 16 The view that an LTC owner can use the main home exclusion is consistent with an officials’ comment on a submission discussed in the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill (Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, October 2015) at page 36. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 21 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example | Tauira 4 – Main home exclusion can apply for LTC owners Facts An LTC has two LTC owners (natural persons). The LTC owns a residential property that was purchased on 19 November 2023 for $1 million. On 31 January 2025, the LTC transfers the residential property to a third party for $1.25 million. Between 19 November 2023 and 31 January 2025, the LTC owners lived in the residential property as their main home. Tax treatment The LTC owners are treated under s HB 1 as holding and disposing of the residential land that the LTC holds and disposes. Therefore, they are subject to the bright-line test in s CB 6A. They have income under s CB 6A because the residential land has been disposed of within two years of their bright-line start date. However, they are eligible for the main home exclusion, so no assessable income arises for them from the disposal of the property. 71. The application of rollover relief is illustrated in Example | Tauira 5. Example | Tauira 5 - Transfer of residential land to an LTC Persons 1 and 2 purchase a residential property as joint tenants for $1 million. The instrument to transfer the land to them is registered on 1 August 2023. On 1 August 2024, persons 1 and 2 transfer the land to an LTC for $1.1 million. Persons 1 and 2 own the LTC in equal shares and are also directors of the LTC. They have owned the LTC for several years. On 1 May 2026, the LTC transfers the land to a third party for $1.2 million. Persons 1 and 2 did not live in the property at any time. They used it as a rental property. Transfer to LTC In their non-LTC owner capacities, persons 1 and 2 are each treated as disposing of a 50% interest in the residential land to the LTC. This occurs within two years of their bright-line start date and the main home exclusion does not apply. Therefore, the bright-line test applies to this disposal. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 22 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] However, persons 1 and 2 are eligible for rollover relief on the disposal because they are each associated with the LTC (this is because, at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date, they were LTC owners and directors of the LTC; they also each had effective look-through interests in the LTC of more than 25%). The rollover relief includes:  persons 1 and 2, in their non-LTC owner capacities, are each treated as disposing of their share of the land for $500,000 - this equals the cost that they each incurred, so they do not realise a profit from the disposal;  in their capacities as LTC owners, persons 1 and 2 are each treated as acquiring a share of the land at a cost of $500,000;  in their capacities as LTC owners, persons 1 and 2 are treated as having a bright-line start date of 1 August 2023, the same bright-line start date they had in their non-LTC owner capacities; and  in their capacities as LTC owners, persons 1 and 2 are attributed with the use of the land that they had in their non-LTC owner capacities. Transfer to third party The bright-line test does not apply to the transfer of the residential land to the third party on 1 May 2026. When the LTC transfers the land to the third party, persons 1 and 2 are treated as disposing of their share of the residential land. By virtue of the rollover relief provided by s FD 1(3), persons 1 and 2, in their capacities as LTC owners, are each treated as having a bright-line start date of 1 August 2023. The transfer to the third party on 1 May 2026 is not within two years of this bright-line start date, so the bright-line test does not apply. If no rollover relief applies 72. If rollover relief does not apply, the value of the transfer is the market value of the land if s GC 1 applies, or the actual consideration provided for the transfer if s GC 1 does not apply. 73. Section GC 1 applies to the disposal of trading stock. The definition of “trading stock” includes land whose disposal would produce income under any of ss CB 6A to CB 15 (which relate to income from land). 17 17 Para (b)(v) of the definition of “trading stock” in s YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 23 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 74. Section GC 1 will apply to a person who transfers their interest in land to an LTC (producing income under s CB 6A) if:  The land is disposed of for no consideration or a consideration that is less than market value; 18 and  One of the following applies: o the person does not carry on business, or if they do carry on business, the transfer of the land is not made in the course of carrying on the business for the purpose of deriving their assessable or excluded income (or both); 19 or o the person and the LTC are associated. 20 75. It will be common for the LTC and the LTC owners to be associated. Therefore, where land is disposed of for no consideration or a consideration that is less than market value, it will be common for s GC 1 to apply and for the value of the transfer to be the market value. 76. If rollover relief does not apply, the bright-line start date will usually be the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the LTC was registered under the Land Transfer Act 2017 (s CB 6A(2) . However, there are some exceptions to this, for example, if the land is outside New Zealand or if the land was acquired on the completion of a land development or subdivision. 77. The application of s GC 1 is illustrated in Example | Tauira 6. Example | Tauira 6 – Application of s GC 1 where no rollover relief applies Facts In August 2024, persons 1 and 2 purchase a house together as a residential rental property. The purchase price is $1 million. The instrument to transfer the land to persons 1 and 2 is registered on 20 August 2024. On 20 October 2025, despite their accountant’s advice, persons 1 and 2 transfer the property to a newly incorporated company that they have elected to be an LTC and in which they have equal shares. On 20 October 2025 the value of the property has increased to $1.1 million, but they transfer the property to the LTC for $1 million. 18 Section GC 1(1)(a). 19 Section GC 1(1)(b)(ii). 20 Section GC 1(1)(b)(iii). Section GC 1(1)(b)(i) is not relevant in this situation because the land is being disposed of to the LTC, not taken by the person for their own use. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 24 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bright-line test and rollover The bright-line test applies to the disposal of the land because the disposal is within two years of the bright-line start date. Rollover relief does not apply because persons 1 and 2 have not been associated with the LTC for at least two years before the date of transfer. Application of s GC 1 The transfer of the land to the LTC is treated as being made at market value under s GC 1. The requirements of s GC 1 are satisfied because the land comes within the definition of “trading stock” (because of the application of s CB 6A) , the land is transferred for an amount that is less than its market value, and the disposal is to an associated person (unlike in s FD 1, there is no requirement for the association to have existed for at least two years before the date of transfer). Persons 1 and 2 therefore have income of $1.1 million ($550,000 each) and deductions of $1 million ($500,000 each) for the cost of the land. Section GC 1(3) also applies to the LTC owners as transferees, treating the $1.1 million market value of the land as expenditure incurred by the LTC owners ($550,000 each) in acquiring the land. The LTC owners as transferees have bright-line start dates of 20 October 2025 for their interests in the land. Where an LTC transfers residential land to the LTC owners 78. This section discusses the situation where residential land is transferred from an LTC to one or more of the LTC owners in their separate capacities. 79. The situation is the reverse of the previous situation discussed from \[9\] (where a person transfers an interest in residential land to an LTC). The tax treatment in this situation is similar to the tax treatment that applies to the previous situation. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 25 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether there is a disposal 80. In this situation, the Commissioner considers that there is a disposal from the LTC to the LTC owner or owners. With one exception, the reasons for this are the same as for the previous situation, as discussed from \[12\]. 81. In determining whether there is a disposal when an LTC transfers an interest in property to an LTC owner, it is relevant to ask whether the interest in property 21 that the LTC owner has before and after the transfer, in their capacity as LTC owner and in their separate capacity, is the same. If they have a different interest property after the transfer, then they may have disposed of their original interest in property and replaced it with a new interest in property. 82. The nature of an LTC owner’s interest in property owned by the LTC has been discussed from \[15\]. 83. The nature of an LTC owner’s interest in property has two dimensions:  the nature of the interests that LTC owners have for non-tax law purposes; and  the effect of s HB 1 (LTCs are transparent). For non-tax law purposes 84. For non-tax law purposes, an LTC owner does not own property that the LTC owns . An LTC is a normal company – an entity that is separate from its owners. An LTC owner is merely a shareholder of the company. A company's property does not belong to the shareholders. Shareholders are not entitled to anything except for the ownership interests given by their shares. These ownership interests might include the right to a share on the distribution of the surplus assets of the company if it is liquidated or wound up. However, this interest is quite different from an interest that a person holds where they own property directly. 85. Therefore, for non-tax law purposes, when an LTC transfers an interest in land to an LTC owner, the LTC owner receives a very different interest compared with the ownership interest given by their shares. The effect of s HB 1 (LTCs are transparent) 86. It might be argued that the transparent tax treatment under s HB 1 prevents the existence of a disposal on the basis that an LTC owner owns, or is treated by s HB 1 as owning, an interest in the property before and after the transfer. Section HB 1 is discussed from \[21\]. 21 In terms of their rights and obligations the LTC owners have with respect to the property. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 26 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 87. The Commissioner’s view is that transparency under s HB 1 does not apply to prevent the existence of a disposal. 88. In the previous situation, one of the reasons for the conclusion that s HB 1 did not apply was that the person or persons who were transferring the land, and who were potentially subject to the bright-line test, were not acting in their capacity as LTC owners (see from \[24\]). The same reason does not apply in this situation. In this situation, the LTC owners would be the persons transferring the interest in land and, therefore, the persons potentially subject to the bright-line test. In transferring their interest in land, they would be acting in their capacity as LTC owners. 89. However, other reasons support the view that s HB 1 does not apply to prevent the existence of a disposal, which are the same reasons discussed for the previous situation (see \[28\] to \[30\]). In summary, the Commissioner considers that to apply the statutory fictions in s HB 1 in this situation would be going further than is necessary to achieve the purpose of s HB 1. There is no indication of any intention that the income tax treatments provided by s HB 1 were to apply to a context such as this. The view that there is a disposal is also consistent with legislative history of the now repealed s CB 6AB and ss FC 9B and FC 9C. 90. Therefore, where an LTC transfers residential land to one or more LTC owners (transferees) there are disposals of shares in the land by the LTC owners, as transferors and in their LTC owner capacities, to the transferees. Whether the main home exclusion applies 91. If the disposal is made within two years of the transferors’ bright-line start dates, the bright-line test in s CB 6A could apply to the transferors. 92. However, the bright-line test in s CB 6A does not apply if the main home exclusion in s CB 16A applies. 93. The earlier discussion about the main home exclusion (see from \[31\]) also applies to this situation. As discussed from \[ 68\], an LTC owner can satisfy the requirements and receive the benefit of the main home exclusion where residential land is held by an LTC. Main home exclusion count 94. Another requirement for the main home exclusion to apply is that the person has not used the main home exclusion two or more times within the two years immediately before the bright-line end date for the residential land. 95. One question relevant to counting the number of times a person has used the main home exclusion is whether the main home exclusion is used if the safe harbour rule in IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 27 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] s HB 5 also applies (discussed further in \[96\]). Where an LTC owner disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC, and the requirements of s HB 5 are satisfied, s HB 5(3) treats the disposal payment as excluded income of the LTC owner. Therefore, two exclusions could potentially apply to the disposal payment: the main home exclusion and the exclusion in s HB 5(3). 96. In this situation, the Commissioner’s view is that the main home exclusion is not used if the safe harbour rule in s HB 5 applies to a disposal. The exception to the main home exclusion is intended to impose a limitation on the use of the exclusion, which prevents the exclusion from being abused. The safe harbour rule in s HB 5 essentially allows for the transfer and deferral of tax liability to another LTC owner where the amount paid for the ownership interest is close to the gross tax value less liabilities of the LTC (in the case of residential land, the gross tax value is the cost of the residential land, as revenue account property). This is not a transfer that Parliament would have intended to be counted in the exception to the main home exclusion. Whether rollover relief applies 97. The discussion about whether rollover relief applies in the context of the previous situation (see from \[38\]) also largely applies to this situation. 98. One practical difference is that in this situation, where the transfer is from the LTC to one or more of the LTC owners, it is more likely that the LTC and the LTC owners will have been associated for two years before the date of transfer. Therefore, rollover relief will be more common in this situation than the previous one. 99. Where the requirements for rollover relief are met, the following rollover relief applies. Disposal amount 100. The transferors (in this situation, the LTC owners in their capacities as LTC owners) are each treated under s FD 1(2) as transferring a share of the residential land for an amount that equals the cost of that share to the transferor. This means that they will not have any profit or loss from the disposal. Acquisition cost 101. The transferee (in this situation, an LTC owner, but in their non-LTC owner capacity) is treated under s FD 1(2) as acquiring an interest in the residential land for an amount that equals the cost of the land to the transferors. 102. The cost of the residential land to the LTC owners (as transferors) is not necessarily the cost of the land to the LTC. This is because changes in LTC owners over time may have resulted in shares in the land being transferred between owners. If such transfers have IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 28 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] occurred, different owners, who have acquired shares in the land at different times, can have different cost bases for their share of the land owned by the LTC, even if they have the same effective look through interest as other LTC owners. Therefore, the cost of the land to the transferors is the total of the costs of all the LTC owners. 103. Each transferee will have a share of the total cost of the residential land to the LTC owners (as transferors). 104. The calculation of the transferors’ total cost is illustrated in Example | Tauira 7. Example | Tauira 7 – Transferors' total cost An LTC originally had two LTC owners: persons 1 and 2, with equal owner’s interests in the LTC. On 5 October 2023 the LTC purchased residential land for $1 million. This resulted in person 1 and 2 having a cost base for the land of $500,000 each. On 6 October 2025, person 2 sold their 50% owner’s interest in the LTC to person 3 for $600,000. This sale was not subject to the bright-line test because the sale was not within two years of person 2’s bright-line start date (it is assumed the safe harbour rules in subpart HB do not apply). Of the $600,000 purchase price paid for the shares, persons 2 and 3 agreed to allocate $550,000 to the acquisition of the share of the residential land. This resulted in person 3 having a cost base for the land of $550,000. On 7 October 2027, the LTC transfers the land to person 3 for $1.3 million. Persons 1 and 3, in their capacities as LTC owners, are treated as disposing of their 50% shares in the land to person 3, in person 3’s non-LTC capacity. The disposal is not within two years of person 1’s bright-line start date of 5 October 2023 or person 3’s bright-line start date of 6 October 2025, so neither has income under the bright-line test. For person 3, as transferee, rollover relief applies because the LTC and person 3 are associated on the date of transfer and for at least two years before the date of transfer. Person 3 is treated under s FD 1(2) as acquiring the interest in the residential land for an amount that equals the cost of the interest to the transferors. This is $1.1 million, the total of person 1’s cost of $500,000 and person 3’s cost of $600,000. Person 3 is also treated as having the transferors’ bright-line start dates. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 29 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bright-line start date 105. Under s FD 1(3), rollover relief is provided to the transferee in relation to their bright- line start date for an interest in land they acquire. The transferee is treated as having the same bright-line start date for an interest in land as the transferor. In other words, the bright-line start date for the interest in land does not reset. 106. Different LTC owners (as transferors) could have different bright-line start dates for their share of the land. If so, the transferee will have different bright-line start dates for the share of the land acquired from each transferor. If the transferee subsequently disposes of the land, this could lead to the bright-line test applying to only a portion of the land that is being disposed of. This is illustrated in Example | Tauira 8. Example | Tauira 8 - different bright-line start dates An LTC owns residential land. It has two LTC owners with equal owner’s interests, persons 1 and 2. Person 1 has a bright-line start date of 1 February 2024 and person 2 has a bright-line start date of 1 February 2025. On 31 July 2025, the LTC owners transfer the residential land to person 2 (in person 2’s non-LTC owner capacity). Rollover relief applies and person 2 ( as transferee) is treated as having person 1’s bright-line start date of 1 February 2024 with respect to the share of land acquired from person 1, and person 2’s bright-line start date of 1 February 2025 with respect to the share of land they acquired from themselves (in their different capacities). On 31 July 2026, person 2 disposes of the land to third party. The bright-line test will not apply with respect to the share of the land acquired from person 1 as the land is not disposed of within two years of the bright-line start date for that share (1 February 2024). However, the bright-line test will apply with respect to the share of the land that person 2 acquired from themselves, because the land was disposed of within two years of the bright-line acquisition date of that share (1 February 2025). Transferor’s use of land is attributed to transferee 107. Under s FD 1(4), the transferors’ use of the land (and the periods of time in which it is so used) is attributed to the transferee. This is relevant to whether the transferee can satisfy the requirements of the main home exclusion if they subsequently dispose of the land within two years of their bright-line start date. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 30 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 108. Section FD 1(4) is relevant because for the main home exclusion to apply to a disposal of residential land by a person, the land must have been used predominantly, “for most of the bright-line period”, for a dwelling that was the main home. The attribution of the transferor’s use of the land to the transferee under s FD 1(4) can determine whether residential land has been used as a main home “for most of the bright-line period”. If no rollover relief applies 109. If rollover relief does not apply, the value of the transfer is the market value of the land if s GC 1 applies, or the actual consideration provided for the transfer if s GC 1 does not apply. See discussion of s GC 1 from \[74\]. 110. If rollover relief does not apply, the bright-line start date is determined under s CB 6A(2). The bright-line start date in this situation will usually be the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to an LTC owner (in their non-LTC owner capacity) was registered under the Land Transfer Act 2017. 111. Example | Tauira 9 illustrates the analysis in this section. Example | Tauira 9 - Transfer of residential land to LTC owners Persons 1 and 2 incorporated a company and elected for it to be an LTC in 2020. Persons 1 and 2 own equal shares in the LTC and are both directors. In November 2023, the LTC acquires residential land for $1 million. The instrument to transfer the land to the LTC is registered on 30 November 2023. For the next 12 months, the LTC uses the land as a rental property. On 30 November 2024, the LTC transfers the residential land to persons 1 and 2 (in their non-LTC owner capacities) for $1.1 million. For the next 10 months, persons 1 and 2 use the land predominantly as their main home before transferring the land to a third party for $1.2 million on 30 September 2025. Transfer to persons 1 and 2 In their LTC owner capacities, persons 1 and 2 are each treated as disposing of a 50% share of the residential land to themselves in their non-LTC owner capacities. This occurs within two years of their bright-line start date and the main home exclusion does not apply. Therefore, the bright-line test applies to this disposal. However, persons 1 and 2 are eligible for rollover relief on the transfer because they are associated with the LTC at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. T hey are associated because at the date of transfer and for the last three years they have been LTC owners and directors of the LTC. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 31 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The rollover relief includes:  in their LTC owner capacities, persons 1 and 2 are each treated as disposing of their share of the land for $500,000 on 30 November 2024 - this equals the cost that they each incurred, so they do not realise a profit or loss from the disposal;  in their non-LTC capacities, persons 1 and 2 are each treated as acquiring a share of the land at a cost of $500,000;  in their non-LTC capacities, persons 1 and 2 are treated as having a bright- line start date of 30 November 2023, the same bright-line start date they had in their LTC owner capacities; and  person 1 and 2’s use of the land as a rental property for 12 months, in their LTC owner capacities, is attributed to person 1 and 2 in their non-LTC owner capacities. Transfer to third party The bright-line test applies to the transfer of the residential land to the third party on 30 September 2025. The transfer is within the two years of the bright-line start date of 30 November 2023 and the main home exclusion does not apply. The main home exclusion does not apply because persons 1 and 2, in their non-LTC owner capacity, have not used the land for most of the bright-line period for a dwelling that was the main home. In this case, the “bright-line period” begins with the bright-line start date of 30 November 2023, the date the LTC acquired the land. The bright-line period is a period of 22 months and persons 1 and 2 are treated as having used the land as a main home for only 10 of these 22 months. Therefore, persons 1 and 2 will each have income of $600,000 ($1.2 million ÷ 2), a deduction of $500,000 ($1 million ÷ 2) and, therefore, a profit of $100,000. If the transfer to the third party had been over 2 months later, the bright-line test would not have applied. Where a company that owns residential land becomes an LTC 112. This section discusses the situation where a company that owns residential land becomes an LTC. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 32 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] There is no disposal in this situation 113. The Commissioner’s view is that there is no disposal of residential land in this situation. 114. For non-tax law purposes, no disposal results from the election to become an LTC. LTCs are a tax concept only and the same company owns the land at all times. 115. In addition, the Act contains no provisions that explicitly treat a company as disposing of its assets when the shareholders elect for the company to become an LTC. In contrast, such a provision exists when a company ceases to be an LTC – see \[121\]. 116. Further, the Commissioner’s view is that s HB 1 does not result in the company disposing of the land to the LTC owners when the company becomes an LTC. The effect of s HB 1 is discussed next. The effect of s HB 1 117. When a company becomes an LTC, s HB 1 treats the LTC owners as holding the land that the LTC holds. This means that before the election, the land is held by the company and after the election, the land is treated by s HB 1 as being held by the LTC owners. From this change, it might be argued that there is a disposal of land. 118. However, for the reasons discussed next, the Commissioner’s view is that s HB 1 does not result in a disposal of the land. 119. Section HB 1 does not apply if the context requires otherwise. Section HB 1 is also a deeming provision that creates statutory fictions. In interpreting a deeming provision that creates a statutory fiction, it is necessary to understand the purpose of the provision. The fiction is then only taken as far as is necessary to achieve the purpose of the provision, and no further. The general purpose of s HB 1 is to provide transparent or look-through income tax treatment for electing closely held companies. The main goal of the look-through income tax treatment is to pass income, expenses, tax credits, rebates, gains and losses through to owners and to tax owners at the level of the owner. 120. By electing for the company to be an LTC, the shareholders of the company are making a choice provided under the Act about how they and the company will be taxed in IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 33 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] future. It seems unlikely that Parliament would have intended for this election to result in a disposal through the operation of s HB 1. The Commissioner’s view is that i f Parliament had intended for the election to result in a disposal, it would have made this explicit. 121. In determining whether there is a disposal of land, it is relevant to consider the context provided by s HB 4(6), which applies where a company ceases to be an LTC. In that situation, which is the reverse of the situation considered here, s HB 4(6) treats an LTC owner as disposing of all their owner’s interests in the LTC (which would include any interest the owner has in residential land the LTC holds). Different conclusions could be reached from the context of s HB 4(6):  On the one hand, it might be argued s HB 4(6) indicates that, in the absence of s HB 4(6) , there would be no disposal when a company ceases to be an LTC. From this, it might then be argued that there would also be no disposal in the situation when the shareholders of a company elect for the company to be an LTC.  On the other hand, it might be argued that s HB 4(6) merely confirms that there is a disposal. However, it seems unlikely that Parliament would explicitly confirm this for the situation where a company ceases to be an LTC, but not for when a company becomes an LTC. 122. On balance, the Commissioner’s view is the first conclusion at \[121\] is more likely to be correct, which suggests that there is no disposal when a company becomes an LTC. 123. Further support for the view that there is no disposal in this situation comes from the context of s CB 32C. Under s CB 32C, an LTC owner can have an amount of income based on the untaxed reserves of the company (but only if a company becomes an LTC after its first year of trading). 22 This is relevant because the calculation of the untaxed reserves involves a hypothetical disposal of property. 124. The formula for the amount included in income under s CB 32C includes a component called “untaxed reserves”. Untaxed reserves contains a subcomponent called “dividends”. The term “dividends” is defined in s CB 32C(7) for the purposes of the calculation of untaxed reserves. It includes the sum of the amounts that would be dividends if the company disposed of all its property at market value. However, this does not mean that there is a disposal of the property. Section CB 32C simply defines an amount based on a hypothetical disposal of the property. 22 Section CB 32C. It is necessary to bring the reserve amounts to tax on becoming an LTC because its status as an LTC means distributions to LTC owners are not taxed. If the reserves were not brought to tax on becoming an LTC, they could be distributed tax free. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 34 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 125. The hypothetical disposal in s CB 32C suggests that Parliament did not consider that there is an actual disposal when a company becomes an LTC. If there was an actual disposal, it would not be necessary to include the hypothetical disposal in s CB 32C. 126. Another provision that applies when a company becomes an LTC is s HB 13(6). This provision treats an entity that ceases to be a “company” on becoming an LTC as having, as an LTC, the same “status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values” as it had as a company for its assets, liabilities, and associated legal rights and obligations. For tax purposes, an entity ceases to be a company on becoming an LTC because the definition of company in s YA 1 excludes an LTC for certain purposes. 127. Section HB 13(6) makes no mention of a disposal occurring when a company becomes an LTC. Nevertheless, it might be argued that if there is no disposal, then it would not have been strictly necessary for s HB 13(6) to provide that the entity has the same status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values it had as a company. However, s HB 13(6) specifically mentions that the entity ceases to be a company, which suggests that it was the ceasing to be a company, not a disposal, that motivated Parliament to confirm these matters. Therefore, it is considered that s HB 13(6) does not indicate there is a disposal. 128. For the reasons given above, the Commissioner considers that for tax purposes when a company becomes an LTC, there is no disposal of residential land or other property that the company holds. 129. Although there is no disposal event when a company becomes an LTC, the LTC owners are treated as holding the residential land that the LTC holds and the LTC owners may be assessable if, in their capacity as LTC owners, they dispose of the land. Therefore, for the purposes of a future disposal by the LTC owners, it is necessary to identify the LTC owners’ cost base for the land and their bright-line start date. LTC owners’ cost base for land 130. If the LTC owners subsequently dispose of the land and have income under s CB 6A, they are allowed a deduction for the cost of the land. 131. As noted at \[126\], s HB 13(6) provides that an entity is treated as having, as an LTC, the same status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values as it had as a company. Because the LTC is treated as having the company’s tax book values, the LTC owners are also treated as having a share of these values under s HB 1. 132. “Tax book values” is not a defined term, but the Commissioner considers the ordinary meaning of this term includes the cost of land acquired by the company. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 35 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Bright-line start date for the LTC owners 133. The Commissioner considers that where a company that owns residential land becomes an LTC, the LTC owners have the same bright-line start date for the land as the company had before it became an LTC. 134. As noted at \[126\], s HB 13(6) provides that an entity is treated as having, as an LTC, the same status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values as it had as a company. Because the LTC is treated as having these tax book timings, t he LTC owners are also treated as having these tax book timings under s HB 1. 135. “Tax book timings” is not a defined term. Based on the ordinary meaning, the Commissioner considers that the term “tax book timings” includes the bright-line start date for residential land that the company owns . 23 Company's use of land attributed to LTC owner 136. By virtue of ss HB 13(6) and HB 1, when a company becomes an LTC, the LTC owners are treated as having the same status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values that the company had. The LTC owners’ bright-line start dates will be the bright-line start date the company had. 137. Th is earlier bright-line start date and, therefore, longer bright-line period can affect whether the land is used as a main home for most of the bright-line period. A company is not able to use land as a home, and the use of land as a main home by the shareholders of the company (before it became an LTC) does not qualify as use by the company. Therefore, the application of the main home exclusion would depend on the LTC owners’ use of the land as a main home after the transfer being long enough to satisfy the “most of the bright-line period” requirement. 138. Example | Tauira 10 and Example | Tauira 11 illustrate the analysis of the situation discussed in this section. Example | Tauira 10 – Company becoming an LTC Facts Company A was incorporated on 1 April 2024. Persons 1 to 3 own the company in equal shares. They are also the directors of the company. 23 This is consistent with the commentary to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022–23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Bill (No 2), which proposed the addition of the words “tax book timings” to s HB 13(6). IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 36 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] On the same day as it was incorporated, company A purchased a residential property to hold as a rental property. The instrument to transfer the land to the company was also registered on 1 April 2024. The property cost $900,000. On 31 March 2025, persons 1 to 3 elected for company A to be an LTC for the 2026 income year. On that date, the residential property had a market value of $1 million. On 5 May 2026, the LTC transfers the land to a third party for $1.1 million. Tax treatment – effect of election When company A became an LTC, persons 1 to 3 were treated under s HB 1 as holding the residential property. This did not result in a disposal of the land from the company to persons 1 to 3 for the purposes of the bright-line test. In their capacity as LTC owners, persons 1 to 3 are each treated as having a cost of $300, 000 and as having a bright-line start date of 1 April 2024 in relation to the land. This is the same bright-line start date that the company had before it became an LTC. When the land is sold to the third party on 5 May 2026, persons 1 to 3 are treated under s HB 1 as disposing of their interests in the land. However, for each person, the disposal is not subject to the bright-line test because the disposal is not within two years of their bright-line start date. Example | Tauira 11 - Attribution of use – where a company becomes an LTC Facts Company A is owned by persons 1 and 2 in equal shares. Company A owns a residential property. The property was purchased on 1 April 2024 for $1 million. On 31 March 2025, persons 1 and 2 elect for the Company to be an LTC for the 2026 income year (from 1 April 2025). On 30 November 2025, the LTC transfers the residential property to a third party for $1.25 million. For the 12 months before the company became an LTC (between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025), the residential property was used as a rental property. For the eight months after the company became an LTC, and before the land was transferred to the third party (between 1 April 2025 and 30 November 2025), the land was used predominantly for a dwelling that was person 1 and 2’s main home. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 37 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Tax treatment When the company became an LTC, the LTC owners were treated by s HB 1 as holding the land, and when the LTC disposed of the land to the third party, the LTC owners were treated as disposing of their interests in the land. Further, when the company became an LTC, persons 1 and 2 (by virtue of s HB 13(6) and HB 1) were treated, as LTC owners, as having the same status, intention, purpose, and tax book timings and values that the company had. This means that the LTC owners have the same cost and bright-line start date as the company. It also means that the company’s ownership and use of the land as a rental property for 12 months is attributed to persons 1 and 2. The transfer of the residential property on 30 November 2025 to the third party is within two years of the bright-line start date of 1 April 2024. Further, the main home exclusion does not apply because persons 1 and 2 did not use the land as a main home for most of the bright-line period. In this case, the bright-line period is a period beginning with the bright-line start date of 1 April 2024 (the date the company purchased the land). This means the bright-line period was a period of 20 months. Persons 1 and 2 used the land as a main home for only eight of these 20 months. Therefore, the bright-line test applies to the disposal and persons 1 and 2 will be taxable on the profit of $250,000 from the disposal. Where a company that owns residential land ceases to be an LTC 139. This section discusses the tax treatment of a company 24 that owns residential land and that ceases to be an LTC. 24 “Company” is used here in a general sense. A company that is an LTC is excluded from the definition of “company” in s YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 38 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether there is a disposal 140. Where a company ceases to be an LTC, s HB 4(6) treats an LTC owner as disposing of all their owner’s interests for the LTC (including any share of residential land). As discussed from \[115\], t here is no similar deemed disposal when a company becomes an LTC. 141. Section HB 4(6) provides: HB 4 General provisions relating to disposals Cessation due to revocation or otherwise (6) A person is treated as disposing of all of their owner’s interests for a look-through company to a single third party for a payment equal to the interests’ market value, if the look-through company ceases to be a look-through company because of a revocation or otherwise, but excluding cessation as described in subsection (3). The company is treated as acquiring all of the person’s interests immediately after the cessation, from the third party, for a payment equal to the interests’ market value, and for the purposes of section CB 15 (Transactions between associated persons), the person disposing of, and the company acquiring, the interests are treated as associated persons. \[Emphasis added\] 142. Section HB 4(6) applies if the company ceases to be a LTC because of a revocation or otherwise, but not if it is a permanent cessation as described in subs (3) (where the company itself ceases to exist as an entity through liquidation, court order, or otherwise). Section HB 4(6) can apply if one or more of the owners decides to revoke the election to be an LTC. Section HB 4(6) can also apply if the company ceases to be an LTC because it no longer satisfies the eligibility criteria. 25 143. Where it applies, s HB 4(6) treats:  an LTC owner as disposing of all their owner’s interests to a (notional) single third party for a payment equal to the market value of the interests; and  the company as acquiring all the LTC owner’s interests immediately after the cessation from the third party for a payment equal to the market value of the interests. Whether the main home exclusion applies 144. If the disposal is made within two years of the LTC owner’s bright-line start date, the bright-line test in s CB 6A could apply to the transfer. 25 An LTC must meet the requirements in the definition of “look-through company” in s YA 1 at all times in the income year. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 39 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 145. However, the bright-line test in s CB 6A does not apply if the main home exclusion in s CB 16A applies. 146. The earlier discussion about the main home exclusion (see from \[31\]) also applies to this situation. Also, as discussed from \[68\], an LTC owner can satisfy the requirements and receive the benefit of the main home exclusion where residential land is held by an LTC. Rollover relief does not apply 147. No rollover relief applies in this situation. For rollover relief in s FD 1 to apply, there must be a transfer of residential land between persons who are associated under ss YB 2 to YB 13. This requirement is not satisfied because under s HB 4(6), the LTC owners are treated as disposing of their interest to a notional third party, which is not a transfer between associated parties. Further, s HB 4(6) specifies that the disposal is at market value, which is inconsistent with rollover relief in relation to the value of the transfer. Value of transfer 148. Because there is no rollover relief, the disposal occurs at market value (as specified by s HB 4(6) ). Bright-line start date 149. The company’s bright-line start date resets. For tax purposes there was a break in the company’s ownership of the land. Section HB 1 treated the LTC owners as holding the land before cessation, and because of the cessation the company is treated under s HB 4(6) as acquiring the land from the notional third party. 150. The new bright-line start date is the date that the company ceased to be an LTC. The reasons for this are as follows. 151. “Bright-line start date” is defined in s CB 6A(2). The subsection defines the term by reference to a table included in the legislation after the wording of the subsection. Section CB 6A(2) states that “A person’s bright-line start date for their disposal of residential land is given in column 3 of the following table if the condition in column 2 of the relevant row is met for the person and the disposal”. In this situation, row 3 of the table is relevant. The condition to be satisfied in row 3 is that “An instrument to transfer the land to the person was not registered before the person’s bright-line end date”. Where this condition is satisfied, the bright-line start date (specified in column 3 of row 3) is the date the person acquired an estate or interest in the land under s CB 15B. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 40 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 152. In this situation (for a subsequent disposal by the company), there will be no instrument registered to transfer the land to the company in relation to the company’s deemed acquisition of the land before the bright-line end date (the date of the subsequent disposal) because no instrument or registration is associated with a deemed disposal. Therefore, the company’s bright-line start date is the date the company acquired an estate or interest in the land under s CB 15B (When land acquired). 153. Section CB 15B provides that a person acquires an estate, interest, or option that is land “on the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest in, or an option to acquire, the land”. The Commissioner considers that a company that ceases to be an LTC acquires an estate or interest in the land on the date that they are treated as acquiring land from the notional third party under s HB 4(6). This is the “date that begins the period in which the person has an estate or interest in the land” referred to in s CB 15B. 154. Example | Tauira 12 illustrates the analysis of the situation discussed in this section. Example | Tauira 12 – Company ceasing to be an LTC Facts Company A is an LTC that persons 1 to 3 own in equal shares. On 28 September 2023, c ompany A purchased residential land for $900,000. It used the property as a rental property. On 31 March 2025, the LTC owners notified IR of the revocation of LTC status. On 1 April 2025, the residential land had a market value of $1.2 million. Tax treatment Company A ceases to be an LTC from 1 April 2025 because of the revocation of LTC status. As LTC owners, persons 1 to 3 each had a one-third share of the residential land that company A owned. As LTC owners, they are each treated as disposing of their share of the land (along with all their other interests in the LTC) on 1 April 2025. On cessation, no rollover relief is available to the LTC owners or the company. Persons 1 to 3 are treated as disposing of the land for market value. Therefore, they each have income under s CB 6A of $400,000 ($1.2 million market value ÷ 3) and are each allowed a deduction of $300,000 ($900,000 ÷ 3) for the cost of the land. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 41 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Company A is treated as acquiring the land for the $1.2 million market value. This will be company A’s cost base for the land in future. The bright-line start date for company A resets on 1 April 2025. Where a person disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC that owns residential land 155. This section discusses the tax treatment when a person disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC that owns residential land. 156. This situation could occur when an LTC owner sells existing shares or when the LTC issues shares to a new owner, which dilutes the existing owners’ interests. Whether there is a disposal 157. If a person disposes of some or all of their owner’s interest in an LTC and the LTC owns residential land, then the person is treated under s HB 1 as disposing of a share of the residential land (based on the owner’s interest that is disposed of). 158. If the disposal is made within two years of the person’s bright-line start date, the bright-line test in s CB 6A could apply to the transfer. Safe harbour rule may apply 159. This situation differs from the previous situations discussed because in this situation the safe harbour rule in s HB 5 may apply in addition to rollover relief. This safe harbour rule can apply where an LTC owner (exiting owner) disposes of some or all of their owner’s interests in an LTC to a new or existing owner (entering owner). 160. Another safe harbour rule, s HB 6 (disposal of trading stock), might appear at first to be relevant, but it does not apply because “trading stock” does not include land for this purpose. 26 26 The definition of trading stock in s YA 1 and s EB 2. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 42 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 161. Where s HB 5 applies, it has two relevant effects:  It treats a payment received by an exiting owner for the disposal of LTC interests as excluded income.  It treats an entering owner – not the exiting owner – as if the entering owner had originally acquired and held the LTC interests. This is relevant when determining the bright-line start date for the entering owner. 162. For s HB 5 to apply:  an exiting owner must dispose of some or all of their owner’s interests to an entering owner; and  the amount calculated using the formula in s HB 5(1) must be less than zero. 163. The formula in s HB 5(1) examines whether the amounts paid or payable to the exiting owner (including the consideration for the current interests and any consideration for other disposals of their owner’s interests that have occurred in the last year) exceed a net asset value (discussed at \[164\]) by more than $50,000. In other words, if the amount paid to the exiting owner is too high, as measured by this formula, s HB 5 does not apply. 164. In the formula, the net asset value is described as the difference between the “gross tax value” and liabilities. “Gross tax value” is the total value of the interests that are disposed of. For the purposes of determining the gross tax value amount, interests that are revenue account property, depreciable property or financial arrangements have the value that the Act gives to them. Revenue account property has its cost value; depreciable property has its adjusted tax value; and the Commissioner will accept a reasonable calculation of the value of a financial arrangement (for example, the value of any interest or principal repayment amounts receivable less any amounts payable under the financial arrangement). Other interests have their market value, for example, land held on capital account. Whether the main home exclusion applies 165. If the disposal is made within two years of the person’s bright-line start date, the bright-line test in s CB 6A could apply to the transfer. 166. However, the bright-line test in s CB 6A does not apply if the main home exclusion in s CB 16A applies. 167. The earlier discussion about the main home exclusion (see from \[31\]) also applies to this situation. Also, as discussed from \[68\], an LTC owner can satisfy the requirements and receive the benefit of the main home exclusion where residential land is held by an LTC. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 43 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether rollover relief applies 168. As noted at \[38\], t here are two alternative tests for the application of rollover relief under s FD 1 (discussed in more detail from \[169\]). Unlike for the situations considered in earlier sections of this statement, both tests can be relevant in this situation, not just the first. Also, for the first test, multiple associated person tests can be relevant in this situation, not just association under s YB 13 (look-through companies and owners of interests). First rollover relief test – transfer between associated persons 169. Under the first test in s FD 1(1)(a), rollover relief applies when residential land is transferred within the bright-line period between persons associated under any of ss YB 2 to YB 13 at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. 170. Sections YB 2 to YB 13 contain all the associated person rules in subpart YB, except the tripartite relationship rule contained in s YB 14. Any of these could apply, except ss YB 2 or YB 3. A person who has a look-through interest in an LTC can only be a natural person or a trustee of at trust. This means that the associated person rules in ss YB 2 (two companies) and YB 3 (company and person other than company) are not applicable in this situation. 171. In the first two situations considered in this statement, for the purposes of the association requirement in s FD 1(1)(a), s HB 1 (Look-through companies are transparent) is ignored. This is because those situations involve transfers of residential land to or from the LTC. In this situation, there is no transfer of land to or from the LTC, rather one of the LTC owners (the exiting owner) is transferring some or all of their shares in the LTC to a new owner (entering owner). In this situation, it is relevant to consider association between the exiting owner and the entering owner. 172. Guidance on the associated person rules can be found in IR620 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes, which can be accessed from this page on Inland Revenue’s website. Second rollover relief test – tr ansfer to trustee 173. Under the second test, r ollover relief can apply in a case where residential land is transferred to a trustee of a trust in which all beneficiaries (ignoring the transferor if they are a beneficiary) are:  associated with the transferor: o at the date of transfer; and o for at least two years before that date (except for beneficiaries that are less than two years old or beneficiaries who have become associated due to IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 44 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] marriage, civil union, de facto relationship or adoption, who must be associated with the transferor since birth, marriage, civil union, de facto relationship or adoption, as applicable); or  an association, club, institution, society, organisation, or trust not carried on for the private profit of any person whose funds are applied wholly or principally to any civic, community, charitable, philanthropic, religious, benevolent, or cultural purpose, whether in New Zealand or elsewhere. Rollover relief 174. The rollover relief in this situation is the same as discussed earlier in the context of transfers between LTCs and LTC owners (see from \[100\]). The rollover relief includes rollover relief in relation to the transferor’s disposal amount, the transferee’s acquisition cost and bright-line start date, and the attribution of the use of the land. If no rollover relief applies 175. If the safe harbour rule (discussed at \[159\]) and rollover relief do not apply, the value of the transfer is the market value of the land if s GC 1 applies, or the actual consideration provided for the transfer if s GC 1 does not apply. See discussion of s GC 1 from \[74\]. 176. Further, if the safe harbour rule and rollover relief do not apply, the bright-line start date for the entering owner will be determined under s CB 6A(2). In this situation (which involves a sale of shares in the LTC), the bright-line start date will generally be the date the entering owner acquires the shares. This is because of the definition of bright-line start date in s CB 6A(2). As discussed at \[151\], the subsection defines the term by reference to a table included in the legislation after the wording of the subsection. Section CB 6A(2) states that “A person’s bright-line start date for their disposal of residential land is given in column 3 of the following table if the condition in column 2 of the relevant row is met for the person and the disposal”. In this situation, row 3 of the table is relevant. The condition to be satisfied in row 3 is that “An instrument to transfer the land to the person was not registered before the person’s bright-line end date”. Because this situation merely involves the disposal or issue of shares in an LTC, the land is unlikely to be registered in the name of the entering owner before the entering owner subsequently disposes of their interest. The land will be registered in the name of the LTC, which is a company for non-tax purposes. Where row 3 applies, the bright-line start date is the date the entering owner acquired an estate or interest in the land under s CB 15B, which in this case is the date the shares in the LTC are acquired by the entering owner. 177. Example | Tauira 13 illustrates the analysis in this section. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 45 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example | Tauira 13 - Disposal of owner's interest in LTC Facts Person 1 is the sole shareholder and director of an LTC. On 6 May 2024, the LTC acquires residential land to hold as a rental property. The land cost $2.4 million. The land is the only asset of the LTC and the LTC does not have any liabilities. On 8 June 2025, person 1 gets married to a person they met 3 months earlier. Shortly after getting married, person 1 reorganises some of their finances. As part of this, on 10 June 2025, person 1 sells 25% of their owner’s interests in the LTC to their daughter, 25% to their nephew and 25% to the trustee of a newly formed trust. The beneficiaries of the trust are person 1, person 1’s children and person 1’s spouse. On 10 June 2025, the land has a market value of $2.6 million. Each 25% owner’s interest is transferred for $610,000 (which in this case, is slightly lower than 25% of the market value of the land). Bright-line test When person 1 sells their owner’s interest in the LTC to the entering owners, person 1 is treated by virtue of s HB 1 as disposing of a share of the residential land. This transfer, on 10 June 2025, is within two years of person 1’s bright-line start date of 6 May 2024. Therefore, the bright-line test will apply to the transfer. However, it is necessary to consider whether the safe harbour rule in s HB 5 or rollover relief under s FD 1 applies. Safe harbour rule The safe harbour rule in s HB 5 applies if the amount calculated using the formula in s HB 5(1) is less than zero: Disposal payment + previous payments – (gross tax value – liabilities) - $50,000 Person 1 is disposing of 75% of their owner’s interest. T herefore, the calculation is as follows: $1,830,000 + 0 – ($1,800,000 – 0) - $50,000 = -$20,000 The result is less than zero, so the safe harbour rule in s HB 5 applies. The safe harbour rule results in the disposal payment being excluded income for the exiting owner (person 1). The entering owners (the daughter, the nephew and the trustee) are treated as if they had originally acquired and held the current interests, not IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 46 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the exiting owner. This means the entering owners are treated as acquiring the land on the date that person 1 (in their capacity as LTC owner) acquired the land, on 6 May 2024. This will be the entering owners’ bright-line start date. It also means the entering owners will have, proportionally, the same cost base as the person 1, that is $600,000 each. Because the safe harbour rule applies it is not necessary to consider whether bright- line rollover relief is available. If the 75% owner’s interest had been transferred for $1,850,000 or more, the safe harbour rule would not apply. The following discusses the bright-line rollover relief that would apply if the safe harbour rule did not apply. Bright-line rollover relief Rollover relief would apply to the transfer to person 1’s daughter and to the trustee, but not to the transfer to the nephew. Rollover relief applies for the transfer to the daughter under s FD 1(1)(a) because person 1 and the daughter are associated under s YB 4 (two relatives) at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. 27 Rollover relief applies for the transfer to the trustee under s FD 1(1)(b). In this case, it does not matter that person 1 has been associated with their new spouse (who is a beneficiary of the trust) for less than two years. Rollover relief does not apply for the transfer to the nephew because association between two relatives under s YB 4 applies only for two degrees of blood relationship. Person 1 will be treated as disposing of 50% of the interests in the land (the total interests transferred to the daughter and the trustee) for an amount that equals 50% of the cost of the land for person 1. This means they will not have a profit with respect to the disposal of this 50% interest. The daughter and the trustee will each be treated as acquiring a 25% share of the land for amounts equal to 25% of the cost of the land for person 1. The daughter and the trustee will also have the same bright-line start date as person 1 for the interests. Rollover relief will not apply for person 1 or the nephew for the 25% interest sold to the nephew. Section GC 1 will treat the transfer as being made at market value. Section GC 1 will apply because the transfer is not made in the course of carrying on a business 27 The exception from association in s YB 4(2) , which applies for the purposes of the “land provisions”, does not apply in this context because s FD 1 is not included within the exhaustive definition of “land provisions” in s YA 1. IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 47 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] (s GC 1(b)(ii)). The market value of the 25% share of land is $650,000 (25% of $2.6 million). Person 1’s cost for the 25% share is $600,000 (25% of $2.4 million). Therefore, person 1 will be taxable on the profit of $50,000. The nephew will have a cost base of $650,000 (s GC 1(3)) and his bright-line start date will reset on 10 June 2025, the date he acquires the owner’s interest and therefore the share of the land. Miscellaneous transfers Transfers following death of a person 178. Where a person who holds residential land dies (the deceased person), the bright-line test does not apply to a transfer of the residential land:  from the deceased person to the executor or administrator of their estate;  from the executor or administrator of the estate to a beneficiary of the estate (beneficiary);  from the executor or administrator of the estate to any other person;  by the beneficiary of the estate to any person; and  by a person (rollover person) to a third party, if the rollover person acquired the land from the beneficiary, and a rollover relief provision in subpart FD applies to the acquisition of the land by the rollover person from the beneficiary. 179. The last bullet ensures that residential land is not subject to the bright-line test merely because it is transferred by a beneficiary into a more appropriate ownership structure after receiving a distribution from an estate. This structure could include an LTC, provided the transfer by the beneficiary to the LTC is eligible for rollover relief. As noted at \[48\], if an LTC is newly formed, the transfer will not be eligible. Transfer of residential land from a trustee of a trust to an LTC 180. A transfer of residential land from a trustee of a trust to an LTC could be eligible for rollover relief if the trustee and the LTC were associated at the date of transfer and for at least two years before that date. 181. The trustee could be associated with the LTC:  under s YB 13(2), if the trustee is an LTC owner with effective look-through interests of 25% or more; or IS XX/XX | Issue date Page 48 of 50 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  under the aggregation rule in s YB 13(3) , if the trustee is associated with an LTC owner under any of ss YB 2 to YB 11 and YB 14 and, as a result, are treated as having effective look-through interests in the LTC of 25% or more. 182. In the latter case, if a trustee is associated with an LTC owner (for example, if the LTC owner is a beneficiary of the trust (s YB 6)) , then under the aggregation rule in s YB 13(3) , the trustee is treated as holding anything held by the LTC owner, which would allow the trustee to be associated with the LTC under s YB 13(2). Transfer of residential land from a company to an LTC 183. A transfer of residential land from a company to an LTC is not eligible for rollover relief. There is no direct associated person test between a company and an LTC. Although an LTC is a company, an LTC is excluded from the definition of company in s YA 1. Therefore, the associated person test in s YB 2 (two companies) does not apply (even if the owners of the company and the LTC are the same). The aggregation test in s YB 3(3) (company and person other than company) also does not apply to associate the company with the LTC via the shareholders of the company, because the aggregation test does not operate based on association under s YB 3.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, interpretation statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (C ommissioner’s Statement, Inland Revenue, December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an interpretation statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.
