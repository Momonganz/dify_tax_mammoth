GST and self-assessment
=======================

2005 amendments provide that GST is a self-assessed tax - like income tax it relies on taxpayers making the initial assessment of their own tax liability.

**_Sections 89D(2C), 89DA(1), 92B, 106(1D), 106(1E), 108A(1), 108A(3), 108B(3)(f) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and sections 2(1), 16(3), 17(3), 19B(2B), 20A(1)(b), Part IV (repealed) and section 51B of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985_**

### Introduction

Amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to provide that GST is a self-assessed tax. GST, like income tax, relies on taxpayers making the initial assessment of their own tax liability. The amendments aligning the GST legislation with the practice of self-assessment follow the legislative approach used for income tax.

### Background

Modern tax administration practices recognise that taxpayers have the best information about their own activities. As such, taxpayers are better placed than the Commissioner to assess their tax liabilities by making the appropriate calculations and furnishing their returns. Therefore both the GST and income tax systems rely on taxpayers making the initial assessment of their tax liability.

Self-assessment for GST was previously not fully provided for in the legislation. Legislating explicitly for self-assessment for GST now aligns the legislation with practice, thus allowing taxpayers' obligations to be provided for more clearly and directly.

Self-assessment for income tax was enacted in 2001 to apply from the 2002-03 income year, and the self-assessment amendments for GST follow the approach for income tax.

Although not involving significant policy change, the introduction of self-assessment into the GST legislation will add to and enhance other improvements being made to simplify tax administration. The GST self-assessment provisions also achieve a better interface between the GST Act and the TAA.

### Application date

The amendments apply to GST taxable periods starting on or after 1 April 2005.

### Key features

Part IV of the GST Act, relating to the assessment of GST, has been repealed. The main effect of former section 27 of the GST Act is achieved by new section 92B of the TAA. A taxpayer who is required to provide a return under the GST Act for a taxable period must make an assessment of the tax payable for the period.

The Commissioner will retain specific powers to amend a taxpayer's assessment under section 113 of the TAA or make an assessment under section 106 if a taxpayer fails to self-assess.

Consequential amendments have been made to the timebar provisions in section 108A for amending GST assessments and the timebar waiver provisions in section 108B of the TAA, reflecting the move to self-assessment. These changes are based on the model used in the income tax time bar provision in section 108.

A number of provisions in the GST Act have been repealed because their effect is replicated by existing provisions in the TAA. For example, the effect of section 29 of the GST Act (assessments deemed correct except in challenge proceedings) is replicated in section 109 of the TAA, so section 29 has been repealed.

### Detailed analysis

**Requiring taxpayers to make a GST assessment**

Part IV of the GST Act, relating to the assessment of GST, has been repealed with its effect being achieved by existing or new provisions in Part VI (assessments) of the TAA. New section 92B in Part VI of the TAA requires a taxpayer (as defined in section 3 of the TAA) to self-assess for GST. In particular, subsection (1) states that a taxpayer who is required to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period. The self-assessment provision also applies to any person required to provide a special return under section 17 of the GST Act.

The terms "GST return period" and "GST payable" in the TAA have the same meanings as the terms "taxable period" and "tax payable" in the GST Act.

**Date of self-assessment**

New section 92B(2) states that the assessment is made on the date on which the taxpayer's GST tax return is received at an office of the department.

In practice, this means that on the date of receipt by Inland Revenue of the taxpayer's return, the return is datestamped - electronically or manually - and it is this date that is entered into Inland Revenue's computer system. Once this date is entered into the system, a return acknowledgement form is generated and sent to the taxpayer. The taxpayer will therefore have a record of the date of receipt, and the date of self-assessment

**Notice of self-assessment**

New section 16(3) of the GST Act provides that a return filed for a taxable period must contain a notice of the assessment made under section 92B of the TAA. Similarly, new section 17(3) of the GST Act provides that a special return required to be provided under section 17(1) must contain a notice of the self-assessment.

**Commissioner amendment of assessments**

The Commissioner retains the power to amend any GST assessments, including those made by the taxpayer. The function of former section 27(2) of the GST Act is achieved by section 113 of the TAA. Section 113 allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time, subject to new section 89N.

**Persons treated as registered**

The function of former section 27(5A) and (6) is now achieved by new section 51B of the GST Act. This section deems persons to be registered in certain situations.

**Commissioner assessments**

The Commissioner retains the power to make an initial assessment (default assessment) if the taxpayer fails to self-assess. Section 106 of the TAA has been amended to enable the Commissioner to make an assessment of the GST payable if a person does not provide a GST tax return (including returns required to be filed because the person is treated as being registered under 51B) or provides a return with which the Commissioner is not satisfied.  
If the Commissioner, instead of the taxpayer, makes the initial assessment, the requirement for a taxpayer to self-assess does not apply.

**Timebar for amending a GST assessment**

Amendments have been made to sections 108A and 108B to reflect self-assessment of GST. The time bar provision in section 108A(1) has been simplified to provide that if a taxpayer provides a GST tax return for a GST return period and an assessment has been made, and four years have passed from the end of the GST return period in which the taxpayer provided the tax return, the Commissioner may not amend the assessment.

**Disputing an assessment made by the Commissioner**

If the Commissioner has made the initial assessment for the taxpayer, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment only after furnishing a GST return. This requirement is contained in new section 89D(2C).

**Disputing a GST self-assessment**

Section 89DA enables taxpayers to propose adjustments to their own assessments by issuing a notice of proposed adjustment. This provision has been amended to incorporate GST self-assessments.

**Consequential amendments**

*   An amendment to section 2(4) of the TAA ensures that Part VI (Assessments) of the TAA applies to GST assessments.  
    
*   The effect of former section 27(3) and (5) is achieved by section 111 of the TAA. In particular, new section 111(8) continues the effect of former section 27(3)(b).  
    
*   The effect of former section 28 of the GST Act is achieved by section 114 of the TAA. Section 114 provides that the validity of an assessment made by the Commissioner is not affected by failure to comply with the Inland Revenue Acts.  
    
*   The effect of former sections 23(3) and 29 of the GST Act is achieved by section 109 of the TAA. Section 109 provides that except in challenge proceedings every disputable decision (which includes an assessment) and its particulars is taken to be correct.  
    
*   The effect of former section 30 of the GST Act relating to evidence of returns and assessments is achieved by section 110 of the TAA.  
    
*   In sections 2(1) and 20A(1)(b) of the GST Act, the reference to section 27(6) has been replaced with a reference to its successor provision new section 51B.

Te tāke hokohoko me te hoko atu, te panoni i te whakamahinga rānei o tētahi whare rēti GST and selling or changing the use of a rental property
===============================================================================================================================================

You must return GST [output tax](/api/glossary/item?id={EBCE9124-4883-4F9E-BFE0-43211475BA80})
 when you either:

*   sell your residential rental property
*   change its use from GST taxable to non-taxable (exempt). 

An example of change of use would be when you go from renting out [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
 to long-term renting. Short stay renting is GST taxable but there's no GST to pay when you rent out long-term.

If you’ve:

*   sold your residential rental property, you need to return GST output tax on the sale price
*   stopped short-term renting, you need to return GST output tax on the market value of the property
*   bought your property with the intention of selling it, then decide to rent it out long-term, you may need to pay back any GST you’ve claimed.

Sometimes you may not have got a full GST claim for a property you buy ([input tax](/api/glossary/item?id={ED8C7235-A822-4F5D-B2EA-0422F7E43E09})
). There are rules that allow an additional adjustment for the unclaimed part of the purchase. 

[Change-in-use adjustments for GST](/gst/gst-adjustments/change-in-use-adjustments-for-gst)

Example: Ahurewa buys a residential property for short-term renting

Ahurewa buys a property to use for short-term renting.

Because short-term renting is a taxable activity, she registers for GST.

Ahurewa must return GST on the short-term rental income received in each GST return. She can also claim GST on the expenses used, or available for use, whilst providing her short-term rental accommodation.

When Ahurewa sells the property she must also return GST on the sale price.

Garfield changes the use of his residential property

Garfield is a GST-registered property developer. He buys a residential property for his property development business.

After developing the property, he decides to rent it out long-term rather than sell it.

Garfield has changed the use from 100% taxable to 100% non-taxable. 

Because the property is no longer being used for making taxable supplies (ie he’s not trying to sell the property anymore), Garfield will need to make a GST change-in-use adjustment. He’ll need to do this in the GST period following the change of use. 

Peter makes a change-in-use adjustment for his yacht

In October 2012, Peter acquires a luxury boat for $800,000 plus GST. On acquisition, he estimated that the boat would be used 100% for charters (a taxable activity). As a result, full input tax credit is claimed.

For the second adjustment period, the boat was only used 80% for taxable activities.

**October 2012** **(boat acquired)**

The percentage of intended use is 100%. The amount of input tax claimed is $120,000, which is $800,000 x 15%.

**March 2013 (end of first adjustment period)**

In the first adjustment period of 6 months, Peter used the boat 100% for charters. As this is the same amount as his intended use, no change-in-use adjustment is required.

**31 March 2014 (end of second adjustment period)**

The second adjustment period lasts for 12 months and ends on 31 March 2014. In this period, Peter used the boat 80% for charters and 20% for personal use (a non-taxable activity). As his use of the boat for taxable activities has changed by more than 10%, Peter must make a change-in-use adjustment.

The percentage of actual use over the 18 months since Peter acquired the boat can be calculated as such:

(100% × 6 months/18 months) + (80% × 12 months/18 months)

33.33 + 53.33 = 86.66%

The percentage of actual use can then be used to calculate the change-in-use adjustment.

(Original intended use percentage - percentage of actual use since acquisition) × original input tax deduction

For Peter, this is:

(100% - 86.66%) × $120,000 = $16,008

In the second adjustment period, Peter must account for $16,008 output tax for the non-taxable use of the boat.

Te tāke hokohoko me tō moni whiwhi rēti wā-poto GST and your short-stay rental income
=====================================================================================

What

GST when you rent out your residential property for short stays

Who

Residential property owners

If you’re renting out property for short stays and your turnover is over $60,000 from all [GST](/api/glossary/item?id={682C0E7B-0612-4CC3-90E0-683E3A9F547B})
 activities, you’ll need to register for and file GST returns. This is because renting [short-stay accommodation](/api/glossary/item?id={362ACC2B-2932-4683-92E8-9A537F6C9A2E})
 is seen as a [taxable activity](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
.

When you’re working out your turnover, you need to add up the turnover from all of your taxable activities. 

To work out if your turnover is over $60,000 include your:

*   total [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
    
*   business income
*   income from working as a contractor (self-employed)
*   rents from an [associated person](/api/glossary/item?id={51FA1411-3A83-4019-8451-CED79A628D11})
     (you must include these at the full market value, that’s the rent you normally charge).

When you’re working out whether your turnover is over $60,000, do not include:

*   rental income if your property is joint-owned. Treat it as separate from your own turnover. This is because the income is not all yours, it belongs to the owners jointly
*   your salary or wages.

Joe and Pierre wonder if they register for GST because of their rental income

Joe and Pierre own a home jointly.

Joe is a self-employed plumber by trade and has $55,000 turnover in a 12-month period. His partner, Pierre, is a self-employed model and his turnover is $58,000 in a 12-month period.

Joe and Pierre do not need to register for GST because the turnover for each of them is less than $60,000.  
  
Joe and Pierre regularly rent out 2 rooms in their house for short stays over the year on Airbnb and get a total of $6,000. The rental income is shared equally. They do not include this income when they work out whether either of them need to register for GST. It is treated for GST as belonging to Joe and Pierre together and is separate from their turnovers. In this example Joe and Pierre do not need to register for GST.

Joe owns the house and Pierre lives with him, do they register for GST?

In this example Joe and Pierre’s situation is almost the same except Joe owns the house on his own and Pierre lives with him.

Because Joe is the owner the $6,000 of rental income only gets added to his other plumbing turnover to see if he needs to register for GST.  
  
In this case Joe, as the owner, would have to register as he's going to have turnover of more than $60,000 in the year.

Curtis rents to his sister for short stays

Curtis is registered for GST and his sister, Saroj, uses his rental property. As his family member, she’s an associated person.  
  
Curtis charges Saroj $50 per night for her stay. Normally market rent for Curtis' property is $150 per night. For GST, Curtis must return GST as though he was paid $150 per night (the market value), not what he charged Saroj.   
  
In the end, it does not matter what Curtis charges Saroj for her stay. Even if she stays for free Curtis must return GST at market value for the days Saroj uses his rental property.

GST avoidance arrangement unsuccessful
======================================

2006 case note - taxpayer obtained GST refunds on the purchase of real estate on very long settlement terms - tax avoidance, Ch'elle Properties, shortfall penalty.

Case

TRA04/2005 Decision Number 9/2006

Legislative References

Goods and Services Act 1985

### Summary

A case similar to Ch'elle Properties where the taxpayer obtained GST refunds on the purchase of real estate on very long settlement terms. Ch'elle Properties was not directly applied to the arrangement but was influential and a Shortfall Penalty confirmed.

### Facts

This case was about obtaining GST input tax refunds on real estate transactions with unusually long settlement periods (in this case over 35 years). It is broadly similar to Ch'elle Properties \[2004\] 3 NZLR 274.

The disputant was incorporated in 17 July 2001. The company was registered for GST in October 2001 on an invoice basis.

Mr C was a property developer and sole director of B Ltd. B Limited entered into agreements for sale and purchase of seven residential properties in Tokoroa, to two companies (collectively T Limited). The two companies were owned by another company which, in turn, was a 50% shareholder in B Limited.

The properties were purchased for $140,000 by T Ltd and each was on-sold to the disputant for $220,000 in October 2001 with deferred settlement until dates varying between June and October 2037.

A deposit of $10 was payable on execution of the agreements and the balance payable on 14 December 2001 "or such later dates as may be agreed upon by the vendor". It appears that the balances of the deposits payable for those agreements have not been paid.

T Limited was never able to give legal title to the disputant as the legal ownership remained with B Limited. T Limited issued seven tax invoices on 30 October 2001. The disputant filed a GST return for the period ending 30 October 2001 which showed $1,540,000 of inputs and nil outputs. The Commissioner declined to pay a refund.

The true value of the properties was questionable due to the mortgagee sale in May 2003, where the properties were sold for $39,000 (equating to $5,571 each). An explanation of this huge discrepancy was that "the properties were ransacked prior to the mortgagee sale". The unquestionable outcome of the sale is that it is highly unlikely that the properties would have been available for the deferred settlement 37 years hence.

### Decision

#### Section 76 tax avoidance

The Judge declined to apply Ch'elle Properties to this case citing the amended statutory provisions.\[par 22\]

However, he said that he had no doubt that the arrangements in this case were designed and intended to exploit the anomaly which the Courts have decided (e.g Nicholls v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1999) 19 NZTC 15,233) results from a mismatch between registration on a payments basis vis a vis an invoice basis. \[par 26\]

The Judge referred to Section 19 of the Act (Accounting basis);

1.  _Subject to sections 19A to 19D, every registered person must account for tax payable on an invoice basis for the purpose of section 20_

Prior to 10 October 2000, s. 19(1) was only subject to ss.19A-19C. Section 19D was enacted from 10 October 2000. At the relevant date it provided:

*   The requirement by a person making a supply for consideration in excess of $225,000 to be registered on an invoice basis for that supply
*   It only applies to agreements for sale and purchase which are not "short term" as defined in s.OB1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (one Year and one day for the amended s. 19D);
*   It catches taxpayers who make more than one relevant supply and the sum of the supplies is more that $225,00; if the Commissioner considers that the person ,making the supplies did so to avoid subs.(1).

The Judge held the opinion that T Limited was used as a vehicle to carry out the arrangements. \[par 29\]

The Judge after considering the criteria of s. 76 Tax Avoidance was of the view that there was clearly a series of contracts backed by a plan of understanding. His Honour cites Challenge to state:

> _"a scheme of arrangement which complies with the specific provisions of a taxing statute may nevertheless fall foul of the anti-avoidance provisions" \[par 41\]_

The fact that the series of transactions was carefully structured to meet the requirements of s. 19(D) does not affect any of the foregoing considerations. He used the words of Rodney Hansen J,

> _"The tension between the commercial and juristic character of the arrangement is stretched to breaking point. It conforms to the letter of the Act while departing from its fundamental objectives. It has therefore the purpose and effect of defeating the intent and application of the Act."_ (at p.285 of Ch'elle) \[par 45 of TRA judgment\]

He held that the scheme offended s. 76 and was void to the Commissioner. The Commissioner was correct in refusing to refund the input credit as filed. \[par 46\]

#### Penalties for taking an abusive tax position

The Judge referred to Mr C's related activities, in which he said that Mr C had been the guiding mind of three similar schemes. Each of the schemes are attempts to finance substantial purchases of real estate using the GST inputs and lengthy deferred settlements creating a mismatch between registration on an invoice basis and registration on a payments basis. Each scheme uses the device on long periods of deferred settlement and dubious price escalation mechanisms which inflate the value of the inputs claimed. \[par 50\]

His Honour focused on the knowledge of Mr C and his associated companies as relevant to the disputant's tax position. This was because His Honour concluded on the evidence that disputant was "closely aware of the detail of the Ch'elle scheme and its chilly reception by the Commissioner" \[par 53\]

His Honour had no difficulty accepting that the shortfall penalty was properly applied in this case. \[par 63\]

Mr C was perfectly aware at the time of these transactions that from December 1999, schemes of this nature were under a cloud. The Judge said,

> _"For somebody who represents himself to have (and has in these proceedings demonstrated) a sound grasp of the relevant law and practice it was highly imprudent of him to continue these schemes as has in this case. It was equally imprudent of the disputant in this case knowing what its principal did to associate itself with such schemes of arrangement."_ \[par 64\]

In the Judge's decision he expressed his opinion that the amount of shortfall penalty applied by the Commissioner was not excessive, and having regard to the circumstances, he was surprised that the Commissioner kept it at the 50% of the maximum permitted. \[par 66\]

GST Deregistration for Non-residents
====================================

Policy issues: GST deregistration for non-residents who do not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand. This amendment applies to persons who register on or after 21 June 2005.

**Section 52(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985**

The Commissioner has been given the discretion to deregister non-residents who do not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand, to prevent the inappropriate refund of GST on their purchases in New Zealand. 

#### Background

The GST Act allows non-residents to register in New Zealand for GST purposes without carrying on any taxable activity in New Zealand if they carry on a taxable activity overseas.  They do this so they can get input tax credits for their expenditure in New Zealand, which may be an appropriate treatment in some cases.  For example, when a person intends to carry on a business activity in New Zealand in the next 12 months, but is in the process of getting ready for that activity, GST refunds should be allowed. 

When non-residents have only a passing or temporary presence in New Zealand, however, it is not desirable, from a policy perspective, to allow them a refund of the GST on their purchases in New Zealand.  An example of when a refund is not appropriate is when an entity not resident in New Zealand supplies services in New Zealand for which it charges nil consideration.  The entity carries on no taxable activity in New Zealand, but can register for GST purposes in New Zealand because it is carrying on a taxable activity overseas.

A non-resident should not be able to claim a GST refund for making supplies in New Zealand for which it does not charge anyone.  The entity's profile is the same as a final consumer, yet, for purposes of GST it is treated as a business.  This meant it could previously claim back the GST on its purchases - often of an entertainment or accommodation nature - in New Zealand.  The amendment gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to deregister a taxpayer in appropriate cases.

New Zealand already collects GST from non-resident businesses that have only a passing connection with New Zealand.  The amendment buttresses this power as it will discourage non-residents who are in New Zealand temporarily and have no intention of carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand from registering for GST in order to claim the GST back on their purchases in New Zealand.

#### Key features

The Commissioner, under section 52 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, is able to cancel the registration of a non-resident who does not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand.  The effect of this deregistration is that the non-resident will not be able to claim back the GST incurred on the goods and services it purchases in New Zealand or it will trigger a supply and consequent output tax liability under section 5(3). 

Consistent with other deregistration provisions, this deregistration could have effect back to the date on which the non-resident was registered for GST in New Zealand if a taxable activity was never carried on in New Zealand from that date.

The amendment is directed primarily at non-residents who have only a passing or temporary connection with New Zealand and who should be treated as final consumers of the goods and services they purchase in New Zealand and are therefore not entitled to a GST refund.

Inland Revenue will prepare guidelines explaining the circumstances when the discretion to deregister a non-resident will be exercised and when it will not.  For example, the discretion will be exercised to prevent non-residents who are temporarily in New Zealand and do not carry on or intend to carry on any taxable activity in New Zealand, and whose only supplies in New Zealand are made for nil consideration, from having the GST on their purchases in New Zealand refunded.  The discretion will not be exercised if the non-resident intends to carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand and registers before beginning operations in New Zealand.

#### Application date

The amendment applies to persons who register for GST on or after the date of enactment, 21 June 2005.

GST deregistration
==================

2005 case note – whether land sales to be taken into account in calculating the threshold for deregistration – GST.

Case

TRA 011/03

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxpayer was registered for GST and carried on a taxable activity of leasing a block of farmland. On 8 December 1999 he made application for cancellation of his GST registration on the grounds his turnover would be less than $30,000 in the next 12 months. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CIR) did not know the Taxpayer had entered an agreement to sell part of the land the same day and the application was granted.

After an investigation, the CIR reinstated the registration. He advised the Taxpayer by letter on 10 August 2000 he had done this under section 51(4) of the GST Act 1985, on the grounds that the Taxpayer remained liable to be registered as he had continued to receive rents in excess of the threshold.

The Taxpayer responded with a NOPA on 9 October 2000. The coversheet to the NOPA directed that the response notice be sent to the agent. The CIR mistakenly sent the response notice by post to the accounting firm which had issued it, which had been retained by the Taxpayer's linked accountant to provide advice on the dispute. The Taxpayer claimed the CIR had failed to effect service of his response notice and the NOPA was deemed to be accepted.

The partner of the accounting firm was summonsed as a witness for the CIR. He confirmed in evidence he had received the response notice on 30 November 2000 and had noted his file accordingly. He gave evidence of a meeting with the Taxpayer and his solicitor that day where he had handed over the response notice. The Taxpayer claimed the CIR could not prove this without relying on evidence arising at a meeting protected by legal professional privilege. He also denied this evidence of service was admissible as the CIR had not included it in his statement of position.

The CIR had served an amended statement of position, but a dispute arose as to the scope of a prior agreement relating to the exchange of amended statements of position, and whether or not that agreement extended to the evidence of service of the response notice.

### Decision - procedural issues

The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") made a finding at paragraphs 230-231 as to the "content and effect of the disputable decision" before him. He found it was the decision to reregister the Taxpayer pursuant to section 51(4) (specifically sections (6) although not referred to) on the grounds the CIR was satisfied that the Taxpayer continued to receive rent and GST in the 12 months after deregistration to a value exceeding $30,000. However, in considering whether the Taxpayer was entitled to deregister he proceeded on the basis that section 51, section 52 and section 76 were all at issue (paragraph 161).

The Authority rejected the CIR's submission that the proceedings were out of time (paragraph 155). He also found that if he was wrong in his finding that the challenge was in time, that the CIR had conducted the dispute in a "confusing and contradictory" way, and this was beyond the control of the Taxpayer, so there were exceptional circumstances for not commencing the challenge in time, and he granted leave to commence the challenge on the date it was actually filed (paragraph 159).

The Authority found the CIR's response notice was valid even though it was sent to the wrong address. The Authority did not accept the CIR's submission the consultant accountant was an agent of the Taxpayer because that accountant made it clear to the CIR he did not have authority to accept a notice of response and the cover sheet on the NOPA indicated the response should go to the "agent" and the linked agent was then named (paragraph 41).

He also declined to uphold the Taxpayer's submission that the consultant's evidence that he received the response notice by post on 30 November 2000 and then gave it to the Taxpayer or his solicitor at a meeting with them the same day was inadmissible on the grounds of legal professional privilege. He found at that the evidence failed the first fundamental test in that it did not arise out of the relationship of confidentiality between lawyer and client (paragraph 78).

The Authority held (paragraph 67) the modes of service in section 14 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are not exclusive. He found that provided the CIR was able to prove the document came to the notice of the Taxpayer in a timely fashion it had been served. On the facts, the inspector posted the letter and response notice on 29 November 2000 (paragraph 96) and it came to the attention of the Taxpayer on 30 November 2000 (paragraph 94).

The Authority found (paragraph 107) the agreement between the parties as to amended statements of position did not extend to the introduction of evidence concerning how the notice of response passed from the consultant to the Taxpayer. However he noted (paragraph 112-113) the CIR did not have to rely on the amended statement of position in this case, as the fact the document came to the attention of the Taxpayer was irrefutable - his advisors responded to it.

### Decision - substantive issues

The fundamental point at issue with regard to re-registration was whether the sales were to be taken into account in calculating the threshold for deregistration. The Authority held at paragraph 256 that because of the proviso in section 51(1)(c) of the GST Act, it is not correct to include the sale proceeds of the land in determining whether or not the threshold has been breached.

The issue was dealt with by the _High Court in CIR v Lopas_ where it was held a sale in contemplation before an application for deregistration was part of the taxable activity.

The Authority has distinguished the case on the basis the sales were entered into after deregistration, and there was no "arrangement" with any party before deregistration. He took no account of preparatory steps taken by the Taxpayer prior to making the application for deregistration, including entering an agreement to sell part of the land on the same day as he applied for deregistration.

==================================================================================================================================================

If you perform or provide listed services in New Zealand using an [online marketplace](/api/glossary/item?id={89DCEE22-82EC-4535-AE11-9873FDE8EE3C})
 (such as a website or app) — the online marketplace will collect and return GST on the sale.

If you do not know whether you’re using an online marketplace, please check with them. These GST rules do not affect services that do not go through an online marketplace.

Listed services
---------------

Listed services include:

*   ride-sharing
*   food and beverage delivery
*   short-stay and visitor accommodation.

How the marketplace rules apply to you
--------------------------------------

How the marketplace rules apply to you depends on whether you are GST-registered or not.

If you perform or provide listed services in New Zealand, you must give your online marketplace your:

*   name
*   IRD number
*   GST registration status.

You must tell your online marketplace if you're GST-registered. If you do not, they may treat you as non-GST-registered. You should also tell them if your GST registration status changes.

Non-GST-registered: Flat-rate credit scheme
-------------------------------------------

A flat-rate credit scheme will apply if you are not GST-registered.

From 1 April 2024, online marketplaces will collect GST at the standard 15% rate on listed services that are performed, provided or received in New Zealand. They will pay 6.5% to us and will pass on 8.5% to you.

This flat-rate credit is for you to keep and recognises the GST on your costs from supplying listed services.

GST-registered
--------------

If you're GST-registered, you must include the supply of listed services sold through a GST-registered online marketplace as a zero-rated supply in your GST return. You can still claim GST on the costs of making supplies of listed services.

If you're also providing listed services that do not go through an online marketplace, the normal GST rules apply. You'll have to pay GST on these services.

If you receive a flat-rate credit when you are GST registered, you'll need to return it to us by making a debit adjustment in your GST return. If you do not do this and carry on receiving flat-rate credits, we may charge you penalties.

Generally, you will have to return GST on the sale of your motor vehicle and property used to provide listed services. There are some situations where you may be able to treat these as non-taxable supplies.

Find out more about electing to treat goods as non-taxable supplies on our GST adjustments page.

[GST adjustments for business, private and exempt use](/gst/gst-adjustments)

When apps and websites are not required to collect GST
------------------------------------------------------

Not all apps and websites meet the definition of an [online marketplace](/api/glossary/item?id={89DCEE22-82EC-4535-AE11-9873FDE8EE3C})
.

This is the case if the business operating the website or app is supplying services directly to the customer. For example, the marketplace rules will not apply to a platform that provides delivery services directly to customers, and hires you to be a delivery driver, either as an employee or an independent contractor.

If you are hired as a driver or delivery driver in these situations, flat-rate credits also do not apply.

You should check your own circumstances to determine if the marketplace rules apply to you.

GST Group Registration of Trusts (July 2004)
============================================

QB (Jul 2004) provides an overview of the rules that relate to the GST group registration of trusts.

Replaced by

IS 24/03
--------

[GST – Who can group register?](/interpretation-statements/2024/is-24-03 "IS 24 03")

1.  The purpose of this item is to provide an overview of the rules that relate to the GST group registration of trusts.

### Legislation

2.  Section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) provides for the group registration of registered persons. In grouping, a registered member of a group of entities is nominated to be its representative member. This member will pay GST on behalf of the entire group. In effect, the entire group is treated as one entity. Section 55(1) allows the grouping of 2 or more companies, which are each registered for GST, and satisfy the requirements of section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994.  
      
    
3.  Section 55(8) of the GST Act provides the rules for determining the group registration of 2 or more registered persons, which are not each companies. The entities can be natural persons, bodies corporate, or trusts, among other things.  
      
    
4.  Subsection (8) refers to the phrase "not each being companies", which means that not all (or indeed any) members of the group need be companies. For example, a trust and a company can be registered as a group of persons. This subsection applies to groups without companies, and also applies to groups that include one or more companies as well as other entities.  
      
    
5.  "Control" is a necessary element in deciding whether a group exists. One of the following conditions must be met:

*   One of them controls each of the others;  
      
    
*   One person controls all of them; or  
      
    
*   Two or more persons carrying on a taxable activity in partnership control all of them.

### Practice

_How has "control" been interpreted by the Courts?_

6.  The principal issue is how widely the term should be interpreted. In particular, does it mean legally enforceable, formal control, or can it include some type of de facto control?  
      
    
7.  _Case K54_ (1988) 10 NZTC 444 involved three cases stated to the Taxation Review Authority. Each case involved an entity applying for group registration under section 55(8) of the GST Act. The issue was whether the Commissioner had correctly exercised his discretion in declining the taxpayers' application for group registration for GST purposes.  
      
    
8.  _Case K54_ discussed the meaning of "control" in the context of section 55(8). As Bathgate DJ explained at page 453: "I conclude that 'control' or 'controls' in the context of sec 55 means discernable, legal control".  
      
    
9.  His Honour rejected de facto control because there is no yardstick to determine what is or is not control. For example, de facto control includes assuming control of an entity by reason of age, family ties, family seniority, or business acumen . His Honour, at page 452, added that Parliament's intention was that control, in terms of section 55, should mean "discernible and effective legal control". This description of "control" is more certain than de facto control. Accordingly, "control" is taken to refer to an identifiable legal power vested in a particular person or persons external to the entity, eg the power to vote in respect of company shares. As His Honour suggests, de facto control in the context of group registration is too wide. Parliament could not have contemplated such a wide interpretation. There would be nothing to indicate when that sort of control "stops or starts".  
      
    
10.  In _Case L42_ (1989) 11 NZTC 1,261, a partnership applied for group registration under section 55(8) of the GST Act. The Commissioner declined the application. Bathgate DJ affirmed _Case K54_ at page 1,262, "namely that there must be discernible legal control". The Taxation Review Authority held for the Commissioner.  
      
    
11.  Therefore, "control" is of the same character applied to companies before they obtain group registration, ie based on holding a majority of the shareholder decision-making rights under the Income Tax Act 1994. In general, legal powers will be reviewed against normal commercial (including accounting) practices.

_When does a person have "discernible legal control" of a trust?_

12.  Generally, a trust is an equitable obligation, which comprises four elements: a trustee, trust property, a beneficiary, and an obligation to deal with the trust property. Trusts can be classified into express trusts or those arising by operation of law.

General rule

13.  A trust is unlike a company, as it does not have the equivalent of shareholders. The beneficiaries, subject to the terms of any deed constituting the trust, do not have the power to direct the trustees. The deed permits the trustees to exercise control of the trust assets via unanimous or majority voting. Trustees act under certain fiduciary obligations on behalf of the beneficiaries, and not in their own personal capacity. Each trust is different. Accordingly, the standard position is that no person controls the trustees, and a trust cannot be part of a GST group simply by virtue of it being under the trusteeship of the same person as another member of the group.  
      
    
14.  There are statutory provisions that provide a mechanism for managing trusts, but these do not usually vest control in another person or trustee.  
      
    

_When does a trustee have "discernible legal control" of another person?_

1.  Company

15.  The trustees have "discernible legal control" when the trust holds more than 50% of the voting power in respect of shareholder decision-making rights. This assumes that the trustees have the power to hold shares and vote at company meetings, in terms of the relevant trust deed.

2.  Partnerships

16.  The terms of the agreement will indicate the degree of "discernible legal control" a trustee has in the partnership. Again, this will be generally be dictated by the level of voting power.

3.  Trusts

17.  In certain circumstances, a trustee is able to group with another trust under section 55(8). This includes situations involving trustees of subtrusts. Just as the trustee of the principal trust will have control of the trust because of the terms of the deed, where this power in respect of the subtrust is vested in the trustees of the principal trust then it may be considered to control the trustees of the subtrust. However, careful analysis of the terms of the relevant deed will normally be required before Inland Revenue will accept this.

### Examples

_A person controlling a trust_

18.  Jim, Reginald, and Isa own 80% of the shares in Balloons Limited. In the deed forming the Azic Family Trust, they have been appointed as the trustees. Both Balloons Limited and the Azic Family Trust carry on taxable activities. The trust deed has given the trustees a wide discretion to exercise their powers. All the trustees have met to discuss the possibility of grouping with Balloons Limited, and unanimously agreed that it is in the interests of the trust to group. The trust deed provides the trustees with "discernible legal control" of the trust, and the same individuals control Balloons Limited.  
      
    
19.  Despite this, in one case the three trustees act on their own behalf as members of Balloons Limited, and in the other they act in the capacity of trustees of the Azic Family Trust, and could be removed. Inland Revenue does not consider that the same persons control both entities. The trustees may not group the Azic Family Trust with Balloons Limited for the purposes of section 55(8).

_A trust controlling a person_

20.  Rupert is the sole trustee of the Knight Farming Trust. The Knight Farming Trust owns 60% of the shares in Eco-Building Limited. The trust instrument states that Rupert, as trustee, has the legal authority to deal with the trust property for the financial benefit of the beneficiaries. As the sole trustee of Knight Farming Trust, Rupert has "discernible legal control" of Eco-Building because of the trust's 60% share in that company. The Knight Farming Trust may be grouped with Eco-Building Limited.

_A trust controlling a trust_

21.  Healthy Living Limited manufactures organic products. The company decides to create a trading trust called Healthy Living Trading Trust. Healthy Living Limited is appointed as the trustee. The beneficiaries are the owners of the company. Healthy Living Limited acting as trustee decides to create a subtrust called Organo Trust under a power contained in the deed. The instrument settling the Healthy Living Trading Trust provides the trustee with the power to deal with Organo Trust for the financial betterment of the beneficiaries within the general purposes of the Healthy Living Trading Trust, including the power to appoint and remove trustees of the Organo Trust.  
      
    
22.  As the trustee of Healthy Living Trading Trust, Healthy Living Limited has "discernible legal control" of Organo Trust because it is the trustee of both trusts, which are linked together beneficially in the principal deed and can control the subtrust for the benefit of the first trust. Therefore, both trusts may group for GST purposes.  
      
    
23.  This reasoning will also apply where two or more independent trusts are governed by the same or similar trustees.

GST grouping rules
==================

2006 amendment to s 55 of the GST Act allows companies to form a GST group even if all of the members are not GST-registered.

##### Section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

Section 55, which governs the treatment of GST groups, has been amended to allow companies to form a GST group even if all of the members are not GST-registered. The change does not affect companies that are already grouped for GST purposes.

### Key features

Section 55(1) now allows a group of companies meeting the requirements of section IG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 to be treated as a group for GST purposes if the total value of taxable supplies made by the companies is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the total supplies made by the group. The change allows companies that were previously unable to form a GST group to now do so and removes the GST risk associated with intra-group supplies.

A consequential change has also been made to section 55(3) to ensure that the representative member of the GST group is a GST-registered person.

### Application date

The amendment applies from 1 October 2001.

GST implications on the supply of equipment
===========================================

2014 case note - disputant lessor of the equipment and the supplier for GST purposes - supply, assignment.

Case

TRA 007/12 \[2014\] NZTRA 08

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") confirmed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessments for goods and services tax ("GST") and shortfall penalties. The TRA found the disputant remained the lessor of the equipment and the supplier for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"). Therefore the disputant was liable for the GST on the leased equipment it provided its customers and shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care.

### Facts

The disputant purchased equipment from equipment vendors using funds borrowed from a finance company ("Finance Limited"). The disputant leased this equipment to its customers under lease agreements which were assigned to Finance Limited. The rental payments paid under the lease agreements were made to Finance Limited. The disputant claimed input tax credits on the purchase price of the equipment but did not return the output tax on the lease rental payments. The Commissioner says that the disputant is liable to return GST on these payments.

To finance the purchase of the equipment, the disputant entered into a Vendor Assignment Facility Agreement ("the Master Agreement") with Finance Limited. Under the Master Agreement, Finance Limited paid the purchase price (including the GST) to the equipment vendor. The disputant (the Vendor under the Master Agreement) assigned its rights under the agreements with its customers ("Customer Agreements") to Finance Limited.

The Master Agreement set out the terms on which the assignments were made. The assignments could be either Mortgage Assignments or Absolute Assignments. An Absolute Assignment represented a sale by the vendor to Finance Limited of the equipment and rights under the Customer Agreement. A Mortgage Assignment represented a security interest over the equipment to Finance Limited.

All but one of the assignments entered into by the disputant with Finance Limited were in the form of Mortgage Assignments not Absolute Assignments.

The Mortgage Assignment provided that in consideration of the amount advanced (the Assignment Amount), the vendor (disputant) assigned all title and property in the equipment, all rights, title and interest in the Customer Agreement and all amounts payable.

Pursuant to the Mortgage Assignment, the disputant agreed (inter alia) to pay to Finance Limited, monies received from the customer under the Customer Agreement. The Customer Agreement was subject to GST and provided that all rental payments are GST exclusive and GST must be paid to the vendor.

The customer would then make the rental payments into a "lock box" bank account in the name of "\[Finance Limited\] t/a. \[disputant\]". Finance Limited had unrestricted access to this bank account and the rental payments, while the disputant's access to the account was limited solely to viewing transactions and balances.

The disputant contended that he understood the assignments between Finance Limited and the disputant were not Mortgage Assignments but a hybrid under which the disputant retained ownership of the equipment and the disputant's right, title and interest in the rental payments were assigned absolutely to Finance Limited. The disputant says that Finance Limited was therefore the supplier and responsible for payment of the GST.

### Decision

The TRA found the Commissioner's witness, Mr B, to be a reliable witness who had a clear knowledge of Finance Limited's contractual documents and the company's practices and procedures. The TRA accepted Mr B's evidence that at the time that the Mortgage Assignments were entered into Finance Limited's computer, they were incorrectly coded as Absolute Assignments resulting in automatically generated letters and documents (including those described above).

The TRA was not satisfied that there was any hybrid arrangement in place. Instead, the TRA found that there was no variation of any sort to the Mortgage Assignment and that the assignments of the Customer Agreements were assignments by way of mortgage to Finance Limited.

The TRA went on to find under the Mortgage Assignment, that the disputant in consideration of the sum advanced by Finance Limited, assigned by way of mortgage to Finance Limited, the equipment and the disputant's rights under the Customer Agreement. The disputant therefore remained the lessor of the equipment and the supplier for the purposes of the GST Act.

In relation to the tax invoices issued by Finance Limited, the TRA confirmed that a supplier will be liable for GST on a taxable supply whether or not they have issued a tax invoice. The fact that Finance Limited may have issued tax invoices or that the disputant may not have done so, does not displace the disputant's liability to pay GST.

Finally, in relation to the shortfall penalty, the TRA agreed with the Commissioner's submission that a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have recognised the obligation to account for the GST on a careful reading of the documents, as these were not complex documents. The TRA was satisfied that the disputant had not acted as a reasonable person would have done in the same circumstances.

GST loophole closed to offshore companies
=========================================

**01 May 2018**

The Government is to close a loophole that gives offshore companies an advantage by not requiring them to collect GST on all goods sold to local consumers.

“Domestic businesses have long called for greater fairness in the treatment of low-value goods from offshore retailers,” says Revenue and Small Business Minister Stuart Nash. “Foreign companies are not required to collect GST on goods under $400. We are now calling for feedback on a system to register these suppliers for GST.”

“There are more than 26,000 small businesses employing more than 62,000 people in the retail sector. Many are in competition with foreign firms who enjoy this tax break. Local firms compete on an uneven playing field. Large multinationals sell exactly the same product into our market without collecting GST.

“Small businesses such as bookshops have convincingly argued they are penalised by a system which is badly out of date. It’s particularly difficult for very small shops outside the main centres. Some Kiwi firms are doubly disadvantaged, as online retailers who sell into Australia will soon pay GST to the Australian Tax Office,” Mr Nash says.

“GST has always been payable on low-value goods but it is not cost effective for Customs to collect it when it is $60 or less,” says Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri.

“GST is collected at the border for goods over $400. We propose making offshore suppliers collect GST on low value goods at the moment of sale, and in turn, buyers of these goods will no longer pay Customs tariffs or border security and biosecurity fees. This will simplify compliance and administration costs at the border. This supports the focus of Customs to make cross-border transactions easier without compromising the need to keep out illicit substances and materials,” says Ms Whaitiri.

“GST has been collected on services and digital products from offshore, such as streamed movies and music, since 2016. This extends that to goods,” says Mr Nash.

“I acknowledge the work of the previous Government which agreed to a GST Discussion Document in July 2017. It forms the basis of the document released today. The former Revenue Minister Judith Collins got the ball rolling on this and it is a pleasure to complete her work. This is an example of an issue with cross party support.

“I also thank the Tax Working Group for its advice to proceed with the proposal. It is consistent with our GST framework, which is broad-based, low-rate, and applies to goods and services traded across borders and consumed here,” Mr Nash says.

1 GST—LOTTERY OPERATORS AND PROMOTERS Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as the “GST –lottery operators and promoters” item published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994). This updated an earlier item “GST –licensed lottery promoters” which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 3 (September 1989). This ruling updates these items and takes into account the introduction of the Gambling Act 2003 and consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 07/11 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 5(10), 9(2)(e), and 10(14), and the definition of “registered person” in section 2. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the conducting of a lottery by any person, society, or corporate society and/or the promotion of any lottery by a licensed promoter, under the Gambling Act 2003. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Under section 5(10), where a person pays an amount in money to participate in a lottery, the amount of money paid to participate is payment for the supply of services by the person, society, or corporate society that conducts the lottery, or licensed promoter who promotes the lottery under the Gambling Act. • Under section 9(2)(e), if a supply is treated as having been made under section 5(10), the time of supply of the service to participate in a lottery is deemed to be when the first drawing or determination of a result commences. • Under section 10(14), if a supply of services is treated as having been made under section 5(10), the consideration in money for the supply is the portion of the amount in money a person pays to participate in the lottery that represents the total proceeds (after deducting the amount of all prizes paid and payable in money) in respect of the lottery. • If a lottery is conducted by any person, society, or corporate society that is registered (or required to be registered) for goods and services tax (GST): 2 - output tax is payable on the amount of money paid to participate in the lottery less the amount of all prizes paid or payable in money; and - input tax credits can be claimed for expenses (such as purchases of non–cash prizes, fees paid to the promoter, and other expenses such as printing tickets). • If a lottery is promoted by a licensed promoter who is registered (or required to be registered) for GST: - output tax is payable on any fees received; and - input tax credits can be claimed for expenses connected with the promotion. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 21 December 2007 and ending on 21 December 2012. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21st day of December 2007. Susan Price Senior Tax Counsel 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 07/11 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 07/11 (the Ruling). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in the “GST– lottery operators and promoters” item published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 5, No 11 (April 1994), which was an updated version of the “GST–licensed lottery promoters” item published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 1, No 3 (September 1989). The Ruling updates these items and takes into account the introduction of the Gambling Act 2003 and consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The Ruling sets out the goods and service tax implications for lottery operators and promoters who are registered (or required to be registered) for GST. Sections 5(10) and 10(14) of the GST Act provide for the treatment of the supply of and consideration paid for gambling services. Section 9(2)(e) of the Act sets out the time of supply for gambling services made under section 5(10). Sections 5(11) and 10(15) of the Act provide that certain terms are as defined in section 4 of the Gambling Act. Legislation Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sections 5(10) and (11) provide: (10) Despite anything in this Act, for the purposes of this Act if a person pays an amount in money to participate in gambling (including a New Zealand lottery), the amount of money paid to participate must be treated as payment for the supply of services by the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who under the Gambling Act 2003 conducts the gambling. (11) For the purposes of subsection (10)— (a) the terms gambling, New Zealand lottery, licensed promoter, and society have the meanings set out in section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003: (b) the term organiser means the New Zealand Lotteries Commission continued by section 236 of the Gambling Act 2003. Section 9(2)(e) provides : (2) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place - ... (e) if the supply is treated as having been made under section 5(10) on the date on which the first drawing or determination of a result of the gambling (including a New Zealand lottery) commences, provided that this paragraph does not apply to an instant game that is a New Zealand lottery or gambling played by means of a gaming machine (as those terms are defined in section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003). Sections 10(14) and (15) provide: 4 (14) If a supply of services is treated as having been made under section 5(10), the consideration in money for the supply is the portion of the amount in money a person pays to participate in the gambling (including a New Zealand lottery) that represents the total proceeds (after deducting the amount of all prizes paid and payable in money) in respect of the gambling. (15) For the purposes of subsection (14), the terms gambling and New Zealand lottery have the meanings set out in section 4(1) of the Gambling Act 2003. Gambling Act 2003 Section 4 of the Gambling Act defines “corporate society”, “gambling”, “licensed promoter”, “lottery” and “society” as follows: corporate society means 1 society that is– (a) incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908; or (b) incorporated as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957; or (c) a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 that– (i) does not have the capacity or power to make a profit; and (ii) is incorporated and conducted solely for authorised purposes; or (d) a working men's club registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 gambling (a) means paying or staking consideration, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance; and (b) includes a sales promotion scheme; and (c) includes bookmaking; and (d) includes betting, paying, or staking consideration on the outcome of a sporting event; but (e) does not include an act, behaviour, or transaction that is declared not to be gambling by regulations made under section 368 licensed promoter means a person who is granted a licence under section 201 to promote a class 3 gambling activity on behalf of a society. Lottery (a) means a scheme or device involving multiple participants for which– (i) a person pays consideration to participate, directly or indirectly; and (ii) prizes of money are distributed according to a draw that takes place after all participants have entered; and (b) includes lotto, raffles, and sweepstakes society means an association of persons established and conducted entirely for purposes other than commercial purposes Section 5 defines “conducting gambling” as follows: Meaning of conducting gambling In this Act, conducting gambling includes any of the following activities: (a) organising, using, managing, supervising, and operating (but not playing) gambling or gambling equipment: (b) distributing the turnover of gambling (for example, by paying prizes, meeting costs, or making grants): (c) selling tickets to participate in gambling: (d) promoting gambling: (e) assisting in activities described in paragraphs (a) to (d). 5 Application of the legislation The running of a lottery is controlled by the Gambling Act 2003. Sections 20 to 31 of the Gambling Act set out four classes of gambling and who may conduct gambling in each class. The key features of these classes are as follows: • Class 1 gambling may be conducted by a “society” or a “corporate society” provided the society or corporate society conducts no more than 1 session of gambling per day, the total value of prizes and potential turnover involved in 1 session of the gambling activity does not exceed $500 and the net proceeds are applied to an authorised purpose. • Class 1 gambling may also be conducted by a person (this includes individuals, and companies and other commercial entities). However, the criteria in respect of the proceeds differ from those for a “society” or “corporate society”. When gambling is conducted by a person, the proceeds must be applied to reward the winners of the gambling or to actual expenses directly incurred in conducting the gambling activity. Therefore, a person may not retain any proceeds for any other purpose. • Class 2 gambling may be conducted by a “society” or “corporate society”. The total value of prizes in 1 session must not exceed $5,000, no more than 1 session of gambling may be conducted per week, and the potential turnover (in 1 session) must not exceed $25,000. The net proceeds must be applied to an authorised purpose. • Class 3 gambling is where the total value of prizes (in 1 session) exceeds $5,000 (section 27 of the Gambling Act) and the net proceeds are applied to an authorised purpose. Class 3 gambling that is not conducted regularly may be conducted by a “society” or “corporate society”. However, Class 3 gambling which is conducted regularly may be conducted only by a “corporate society”. • Class 4 gambling may be conducted only by a “corporate society”. Class 4 gambling is gambling that is not gambling of another class. Currently that means gambling involving a gaming machine. The net proceeds must be applied to an authorised purpose. • In addition to the requirements set out above, all classes of gambling must satisfy the relevant regulations and game rules, and the gambling must not utilise or involve a gaming machine (except where the gambling is Class 4 gambling). There are also certain restrictions surrounding the payment of commission or remuneration to a person who conducts gambling. Although the Gambling Act does not expressly state that the meaning of “gambling” includes a “lottery”, both the definition of gambling and the scheme of the Act support the view that conducting a lottery is a form of gambling. This is consistent with the scope and purpose of the Act, which are to regulate all forms of gambling. Therefore, anyone who is permitted to conduct one of the classes of “gambling” in terms of the Gambling Act can similarly conduct a “lottery” that comes within that class. 6 Licensed promoter When a society conducts a “lottery”, it may be promoted by a “licensed promoter”. The “licensed promoter” is a person who is granted a licence to promote a class 3 gambling activity that is not conducted regularly, on behalf of a “society” or “corporate society”, and who promotes the lottery for a reward. Both sections 5(10) of the GST Act (which refers to a licensed promoter conducting gambling) and section 5(d) of the Gambling Act (which includes “promoting gambling” in the definition of “conducting gambling”) might give the impression that a “licensed promoter” can conduct gambling under the Gambling Act. However, in terms of sections 28(3), 189, 203(2)(c) of the Gambling Act and the definition of “licensed promoter”, a “licensed promoter” may promote class 3 gambling only on behalf of a “society” or “corporate society”. In other words, apart from “promoting gambling”, they cannot conduct gambling in terms of the Gambling Act. Therefore, under the Gambling Act it is the “society” or “corporate society” that conducts the lottery, not the “licensed promoter”. GST implications Person, society, and corporate society The GST implications for a person, a society, and a corporate society are as follows. If a lottery is conducted by any person, society, or corporate society that is registered (or required to be registered) for GST: • the time of supply of the service to participate in the lottery is deemed to be when the first drawing or determination of a result commences (under section 9(2)(e) of the GST Act); • if a supply of services is treated as having been made under section 5(10), output tax is payable on the amount of money paid to participate in the lottery that represents the total proceeds (after deducting the amount of all prizes paid or payable in money) in respect of the lottery (section 10(14)); and • input tax credits may be claimed for expenses such as purchases of non-cash prizes, fees paid to the promoter, and other expenses such as printing tickets. Promoter The GST implications for a promoter are as follows. If a lottery is promoted by a licensed promoter who is registered (or required to be registered) for GST: • output tax is payable on any fees received for promoting the lottery; and • input tax credits may be claimed for expenses connected with the promotion.

GST October filing deadline to be extended
==========================================

**30 September 2021**

Taxpayers will have an extra week to file and pay GST and income tax currently due on October 28 this year. 

This is in response to Inland Revenue's systems shutting down for their final Business Transformation release from 3pm Thursday 21 October until the start of business on Thursday 28 October.

Ministers have agreed to the extra week and will give effect to that decision through an Order in Council. 

Inland Revenue spokesman Richard Owen says Inland Revenue will be closed to customers and all services, including myIR, will be unavailable for several business days.

“We know this is an additional stress and comes at a difficult time for businesses. It’s right before a major filing date and at a time when businesses are still trying to cope in a COVID-affected world,” Richard Owen says.

“Taxpayers will have until 4 November to file and pay the taxes currently due on 28 October.  This will give them more time after our systems come back up to finalise their taxes. It helps customers who are unable to file and pay prior to our system shut down or on 28 October 2021. It also allows IR to switch all its services to one system as planned.

“This last stage of Inland Revenue’s business transformation includes an upgrade to myIR, which will allow customers to do more for themselves, and brings child support into our new system.  We need to make sure these changes are live and working for customers well before Christmas - a time of significant stress for people relying on those payments. 

“Moving this final information into our new system also means Inland Revenue is ready to implement any future COVID relief packages as quickly as possible.

“We’re confident we’re well prepared for this and we’re taking advantage of a holiday (Labour Day) weekend to minimise the number of working days the tax system will be shut.

“Inland Revenue has worked hard to be ready and overcome many challenges including moving out of our Wellington office due to seismic issues, and level 4 lockdowns. I am very proud of the resilience and drive our staff have shown to get us to this point.

Customers can file their returns before our systems shut down on the 21st, or once they come back up on the 28th.   Please do file them by 4 November, as the information the returns provide helps IR to ensure everyone can access the COVID supports available to them,” Richard Owen says.

"We also understand that many businesses could be having financial difficulties at this time. Inland Revenue may be able to help you by cancelling penalties and interest if you can’t pay your tax on time or in full because of COVID-19.

"If cashflow is an issue at the moment due to COVID-19, please contact us as soon as you’re able to and set up an instalment arrangement. Then, so long as you keep to the terms of that arrangement, you won’t have to pay any penalties and interest.

"The easiest way to contact Inland Revenue is through myIR.  Either tick the box on the screen about instalment arrangements saying you have been affected by COVID-19 or send us a message explaining your situation."

Te Tāke Hokohoko (GST) o ngā utu haere, ngā utu kawe me ngā whakapaunga GST on fares, delivery fees and expenses
================================================================================================================

GST-registered ride-sharing drivers or food and beverage deliverers, need to file GST returns. The fares or delivery fees are included as zero-rated supplies. You can claim GST on your costs.

Ride-sharing fares and delivery fees
------------------------------------

GST is charged on the full fare passengers pay for ride-sharing services and delivery fees customers pay for food and beverage deliveries. Usually the online marketplace you're using calculates the full fare or delivery fee, including GST and pays the GST to us.

The service you provide through the marketplace is treated as a zero-rated supply to the online marketplace. They on-supply the service to the customer with GST of 15% added. You must include the full fare or delivery fee without GST in your GST return as sales and as a zero-rated supply. The result is $0 GST for you to pay.

Include the full fare or delivery fee, not the net amount you receive after deducting any marketplace fees or commission.

You will need to look at how each online marketplace charges fares or delivery fees as well as their fees or commission to work out the right way to calculate your GST.

Some online marketplaces include GST on their fees or commission. If they do you can claim the GST on these.

### When you must pay GST on your fares or delivery fees

If you're GST-registered, GST must be paid by you on the full fare or delivery fee when:

*   the online marketplace you're using is not GST-registered
*   the service is not provided through an online marketplace.

[Goods and services tax (GST)](/gst)
 

Expenses
--------

You can claim GST included in the price of goods and services you buy, to the extent they relate to the ride-sharing and food and beverage delivery services you provide, such as:

*   fuel
*   tolls and parking fees
*   registration and insurance
*   service fees or commission charged by the online marketplace
*   an asset, for example, a vehicle.

You claim GST when you file your GST returns.

You must keep taxable supply information for your expenses. Our handy online tool will help you decide on the records you need to keep when you buy goods or services.

[How taxable supply information for GST works](/gst/tax-invoices-for-gst/how-tax-invoices-for-gst-work)

### Only business expenses are claimable

You need to split your expenses and the GST on them between business and personal use ‒ if this applies, for example if the vehicle is not used solely for business purposes. You can only claim the GST input for the business part of the expense.

You must keep records (for example, a logbook) to support your expense claims for business use. You cannot claim expenses related to the private running of your vehicle.

[Claiming GST](https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/claiming-gst)

[GST adjustments for business or private use](https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/gst-adjustments)

### Service fees or commissions

You may be charged GST on service fees or commissions deducted by a GST-registered online marketplace. If this is the case, you can claim the GST if you're GST-registered.

Your online marketplace will provide you with taxable supply information if it charges GST on service fees or commission deducted from the gross fare or delivery fee that it pays to you. You must return the full fare or delivery fee (without GST) as sales and zero-rated supplies and include any GST on service or commission fees in the purchases and expense section.

Example: Completing your GST return

A passenger pays $115 ($100 plus $15 GST) for a fare. Your online marketplace takes a fee of $12 GST inclusive and pays you the net amount of $88.00 ($100 less $12).

To complete your GST return:

*   You must include the full fare of $100 exclusive of GST (20/23rds of the $115 fare) as a sale and as a zero-rated supply.
*   You can claim the GST on the marketplace fee of $1.57 (3/23rds of $12) by including $12 as an expense.

[Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-savings-investment-and-miscellaneous-provisions-act-2006-and-taxation-annual-rates-of-incom "Taxation (savings investment and miscellaneous provisions) Act 2006 and Taxation (annual rates of income tax 2006-07) Act 2006")

GST on fringe benefits
======================

2006 change to the Goods and Services Tax Act extends the circumstances in which fringe benefits are not subject to GST.

##### Section 10 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

A change to section 10(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 extends the circumstances in which fringe benefits are not subject to GST. The change means that GST will not apply to fringe benefits if the GST-registered person providing the benefit is unable to deduct GST when the benefit is acquired. The purpose of the change is to remove the possibility of GST being imposed twice on the supply of certain fringe benefits.

### Background

Fringe benefits are generally subject to GST because the employer is considered to be making a supply of goods and services to the employee. GST, being a tax on final consumption in New Zealand, must be charged on fringe benefits unless the benefit is an exempt or zero-rated supply, or the employer's activity is that of making exempt supplies. The GST treatment of fringe benefits assumes that the GST-registered person can deduct any GST paid.

An example is when gift vouchers are given to employees as a fringe benefit.

The rules relating to vouchers may prevent GSTregistered employers from deducting input tax if the initial supply by the issuer of the gift vouchers to the employer is disregarded. Instead, GST may be accounted for when the vouchers are redeemed for goods and services. Because GST is not charged by the issuer of the vouchers, the GST-registered employer cannot deduct GST when the vouchers are purchased. Section 21I(1) requires tax to be charged when the employer provides the vouchers to an employee. Before the rule change, GST could arguably be charged twice – once when the GST-registered employer provides the vouchers as a fringe benefit and again when the voucher is redeemed.

The rule change now treats the fringe benefit as having a nil value to address the fact that the GST-registered employer is unable to deduct input tax in connection with purchasing the vouchers. GST will still be imposed when the vouchers are redeemed for goods and services.

### Key features

Section 10(7) has been amended to treat the supply of fringe benefits as having a nil value when a GST-registered employer is unable to deduct input tax in connection with purchasing the fringe benefit.

### Application date

The change applies to fringe benefits provided on and after 18 December 2006.

GST on goods and services supplied to security holders
======================================================

2006 changes to the GST Act to clarify the application of GST to supplies of financial services following CIR v Gulf Harbour Developments Ltd (Court of Appeal).

### Sections 2, 3, 5, 9, 10 and 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act

Changes have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act to clarify the application of GST to supplies of financial services following the Court of Appeal decision _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Developments Ltd_. [1](#01)

### Background

Since its enactment in 1985, the Goods and Services Tax Act has contained a number of measures that address the substitution of otherwise taxable goods and services for GST-exempt financial services. Examples of these measures include the exclusions that remove from the definition of "financial services" transactions involving real property and shares in the capital of flat- or officeowning companies. These measures are designed to prevent consumer preferences from being distorted as a result of otherwise taxable goods and services being repackaged as exempt financial services.

Concerns that similar repackaging could occur for nonland transactions were raised by the government in the discussion document, GST and financial services, in the context of participatory securities. However, as the recent Court of Appeal decision, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Gulf Harbour Development Limited has highlighted, the problem of substitution using the definition of "financial services" also applies to equity securities.

For the most part, determining the GST treatment of a transaction according to its form produces the most efficient tax outcome. This outcome, however, needs to be balanced against the effect that substitution, which gives rise to tax advantages, can have on consumer behaviour. If, in the absence of suitable anti-avoidance measures, a product can be offered without GST, consumers will have an obvious preference for this product over an identical product that is subject to GST. An example of a substitution arrangement is illustrated in figure 1.

The recent changes to the GST rules are therefore antiavoidance measures. The amendments are directed at arrangements involving supplies of goods and services to final consumers with either or both the following features:

*   The supplies would be taxable supplies but for the terms of an equity security or participatory security under which the supplies are made.
*   The supplies are for a consideration other than market value, as a consequence of the terms of the equity security or participatory security.

The relevant clauses in the bill initially applied to debt securities as well as equity securities and participatory securities. The inclusion of debt securities in the amendments was in response to concerns regarding the general substitutability between equity and debt. [2](#02)
 References to debt securities were subsequently removed at the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to concerns that their inclusion could require GST to be paid on refundable deposits paid to secure licences to occupy at retirement complexes.

### Key features

The key changes to the GST Act are:

*   A new term, "associated supply", is inserted into section 2. An "associated supply" includes:
    1.  supplies of goods and services for which the supplier and the recipient are associated persons; and/or
    2.  the supply of a right, under an equity security or participatory security, to a supply of goods and services, other than exempt goods and services, which may be for a consideration that is other than at open market value.
*   The meaning of the term "supply" has been amended by inserting new section 5(14B). Section 5(14B) will apply if part of a supply of an equity or participatory security involves an "associated supply". The section treats the "associated supply" as separate from the equity security or participatory security. Section 5(14B) applies to securities that are supplied on and after the date of enactment.

| Instead of annual membership subscriptions, Beta Club's members are offered shares in Beta Club's holding company Beta I Ltd for $11,600.see note The shares are redeemable for $1 in 10 years and permit access to the Beta Club's facilities which are held by Beta II Ltd. Beta I Ltd treats the supply of the membership share as a GST-exempt supply of financial services. Beta II Ltd charges shareholder members an annual fee of $45 (including GST) to cover maintenance costs. The GST consequences arising from the different pricing structures between the competing facilities are as follows: |     |     |     |     |
| **Alpha Club** |     | **Beta Club** |     |     |
| Taxable supplies | $1,350 | Exempt supplies | $1,160 | (allocated each year) |
| GST collected | ($150) | Taxable supplies | $45 |     |
| Net amount | $1,200 | GST collected | ($5) |     |
|     |     | Net amount | $1,200 |     |
|     |     | GST savings | $145 each year |     |
| **Note:** The value of the share is determined by subtracting the nominal annual charge ($40 excluding GST) from the amount required each year from the members ($1,200). Therefore $1,200 - $40 = $1,160. $1,160 x 10 years = $11,600. |     |     |     |     |

*   The application of section 14(1)(a), which exempts the supply of financial services, has been modified. Former sections 14(1)(a)(i) and (ii) have been moved to section 14(1B)(a) and (c) respectively. Section 14(1B) also includes a new paragraph (b) (which will apply to financial services supplied on and after the date of enactment) that excludes from the financial services exemption supplies that come within paragraph (b) of the definition of "associated supply" – that is, the supply of rights to goods and services under an equity or participatory security.

Other changes include:

*   Consequential amendments have been made to sections 9(2)(a) and 10(3) to incorporate the new definition of "associated supply". Section 10(3) requires associated supplies to be made at "open market value". Section 9(2)(a) determines the time of supply for "associated supply" transactions as being the earlier of when:
    *   an invoice is issued;
    *   payment is made in respect of the supply;
    *   the goods are removed by the recipient or made available to the recipient;
    *   the services are performed.
*   Section 3(3)(b) has been repealed. The section previously removed from the definition of "financial services" debt, equity and participatory securities to the extent that they include an interest in land. The section has been removed as the exclusion for these securities will be covered by the definition of "associated supply", section 5(14B) and section 14(1B)(b). The repeal of this section applies to securities that are supplied on and after the date of enactment.

### Application date

The changes will apply from the date of enactment, 3 April 2006.

### Detailed analysis

#### General application

Paragraph (b) of the definition of "associated supply" and section 10(3) will require the supply of a right under an equity or participatory security to be valued at market if it allows the security holder or another person to receive, for no consideration or a consideration less than the open market value, a supply of goods and services.

These provisions, in combination with sections 5(14B) and 14(1B), attempt to remove any GST advantages that may arise as a result of:

*   substituting the supply of otherwise taxable goods and services for a supply of GST-exempt financial services; or
*   substituting the consideration that would otherwise be payable for a supply of taxable goods and services for the consideration payable for the supply of GST-exempt financial services.

The GST advantages are removed as the supplier of the equity or participatory security will be required to attribute the consideration received for a GST-exempt security to the supply of the goods and services to the extent of the open market value of those goods and services.

**Example 1: Marina berth**  
  
Travis pays $59,000 for a GST-exempt participatory security offered by a company, Construction Ltd, which is constructing a new marina. Once the marina is completed, the security entitles Travis to berth a yacht at the facility. Travis is not required to make any further payments for using the marina facilities. Under the new rules the supplier of the marina will have to attribute to the marina berth, to the extent of its open market value, some or all of the $59,000 received for the GST-exempt security.

#### Limits to the term "associated supply"

There are two exclusions from paragraph (b) of the definition of "associated supply". The exclusions apply if the equity security or participatory security:

*   gives a right to exempt supplies of goods and services, such as dividends, bonus share issues or residential accommodation; or
*   provides rights in relation to the control of the issuer, such as voting rights.

These exclusions attempt to remove rights that would be exempt from GST or that are inherently associated with equity investment from the definition of "associated supply". The limitations also ensure that the definition of "associated supply" is solely directed at situations where the ownership of an otherwise taxable supply of goods and services is, in substance, transferred without participation in the investment vehicle's capital or assets (or where such participation is merely ancillary).

**Example 2: Company shareholder**  
  
Maude purchases shares in a company for $20,000. The shares entitle Maude to dividends and supplies of goods and services. Under the new rules the company will have to recognise a liability for GST on the market value of the goods and services supplied to Maude if those goods and services are supplied under the rights given by the shares. Any dividends that are paid to Maude from holding the shares will continue to be treated as GST-exempt.  
**Example 3: Unit trust**  
  
Regan purchases units in a unit trust. The purpose of the units is to participate in a number of property development projects. The units entitle Regan to a share of income produced by the development projects. The units also give a beneficial interest in the underlying assets and, if the unit trust is liquidated or wound up, Regan is entitled to receive a share of the physical assets.  
  
Although the units give Regan beneficial rights to receive a share of the physical assets, the purpose of the units is to allow participation in any earnings produced by the property development projects. An "associated supply" is not considered to be created at the time the units are supplied because the intent of the units is not directed at transferring any project assets for Regan's use. An "associated supply" may be created at a later date if any assets belonging to the property development projects are subsequently transferred to Regan.

#### Market value

The objective of the amendments is to ensure that GST applies to supplies of taxable goods and services that arise as a result of a final consumer holding an equity or participatory security. Although the amendments apply to "associated supplies" to both consumer and business security holders, the valuation rules in sections 10(3) and 10(3A) mean that the requirement to value at open market value any goods and services treated as separately supplied under section 5(14B) generally arises only in respect of final consumers.

The open market value rules also do not apply if the consideration for the "associated supply" equals or is greater than the open market value of the supply. Section 4, which defines "open market value", uses a "willing buyer/willing seller" test to determine the open market value of a supply. Inland Revenue has made a number of observations about the terms used in the definition of "open market value". [3](#03)
 The terms "similar circumstances" and "freely offered" in section 4 are particularly relevant for the treatment of goods and services that are supplied to the security holder for a discount.

If an "associated supply" arises as a result of a discount because a security holder holds a security in the GSTregistered person supplying the relevant goods and services, whether the discounted price may be treated as the open market value will depend on the circumstances under which the discount is offered. The discounted price could equate to open market value if, for example, it was comparable to a discount offered to the general public.

**Example 4: Company shareholder**  
  
Cally pays $11,000 for a parcel (5,000) of shares in Global Retail Ltd. The shares allow shareholders to vote at shareholder meetings and receive dividends. Shareholders of Global Retail Ltd are also entitled to acquire goods and services from Global Retail's subsidiary company Local Retail Ltd for a discounted amount. The discount is 5% and is equivalent to discounts offered under Local Retail's frequent shopper programme once the shopper has spent more than $500 in three months.  
  
The membership security is GST-exempt when supplied. However, if Cally purchases goods from Local Retail Ltd for a discount, consideration should be given at the time of supply as to whether GST should be returned on the full purchase price of the goods rather that the discounted price. As the discount offered by Local Retail Ltd is comparable to the discount it offers its customers under its frequent shopper programme, Local Retail is not required to return GST on the full price.

1 Goods and services tax on listed services GST information for listing intermediaries including property managers and agents AD282 Online marketplaces (also known as digital platforms) must collect GST on all listed services provided through their online marketplace. Find out what you need to do. The listed services rules Since 1 April 2024, GST registered online marketplaces that facilitate the sale of listed services by sellers must collect and pay GST of 15% when the service is performed, provided, or received in New Zealand. What listed services are Listed services include the sale of short-stay and visitor accommodation by an accommodation owner through an online marketplace. Listed services do not include supplies of residential rental accommodation that are exempt from GST. This will generally be the case if the accommodation is used by the tenant as their home and there is a residential tenancy agreement. GST must also be collected by the online marketplace on closely connected services provided by the same accommodation owner if they are made available through the marketplace. For example, holiday rental cleaning fees charged on top of the accommodation costs. Services that are not provided through an online marketplace are unaffected by these GST rules. For example, the sale of visitor accommodation services sold through an accommodation owner’s personal website, over the phone, by email or in person. Listing intermediaries The listed services rules apply to listing intermediaries. You will be a listing intermediary if you are a GST-registered person who has entered into an agreement with a marketplace operator in your name to list or advertise visitor accommodation on behalf of the accommodation owner. Common examples are property managers and agents. You will not be a listing intermediary if you only assist accommodation owners to make their own listings on an online marketplace, or if you are not registered for GST. If you are not a listing intermediary, and you have clients that are using an online marketplace, you will need to provide the online marketplace with your client’s details. You do not register with Inland Revenue for your listing intermediary activities separately from your other activities. There are no special GST returns for listing intermediaries for these activities. If you also operate a website or app that allows guests to book accommodation from accommodation owners, you will be an online marketplace for those bookings. For more information about how the rules apply to online marketplaces, see our factsheet Goods and services tax (GST) on listed services – AD278. Listing intermediaries’ obligations If you are a listing intermediary, you: • need to administer the flat-rate credit scheme • may need to help larger accommodation hosts opt-out • may be able to agree with the online marketplace you will be responsible for the GST. Administering the flat-rate credit scheme If you are a listing intermediary, you will need to administer the flat-rate credit scheme for non-GST-registered accommodation owners. This scheme recognises the average costs these accommodation owners incur and would be able to recover if they were GST-registered. Under this scheme, you must claim a flat-rate credit equal to 8.5% of the GST-exclusive price paid by the guest for the accommodation as a credit adjustment in your GST return. Calculate this on the full price paid to the accommodation owner. Do not reduce the flat-rate credit for any discounts provided by the marketplace to guests. You must pass on this credit to the accommodation owner. You can choose when this is paid to fit in with your ordinary payments to them. If the guest also pays you a fee, for example for booking or cleaning services you provide the guest, that amount is not included in the flat-rate credit calculation. 2 Hannah is not GST-registered. She rents out a property on an online marketplace through a property manager. The property is in New Zealand and is available for holiday accommodation. Hannah charges $100 per night. The guest also pays the property manager a fee of $20 per stay for cleaning. The property manager claims a credit adjustment for a flat-rate credit of $8.50 (8.5% of $100 paid by the guest to Hannah). The $20 cleaning fee is not a payment for listed services provided by the accommodation owner and so does not qualify for the flat-rate credit. The property manager passes on the flat-rate credit to Hannah paying her $8.50. Example – Flat-rate credit calculation To calculate the flat-rate credit from: • a GST-exclusive amount paid by a customer, multiply it by 8.5/100. • a GST-inclusive amount, multiply it by 17/230. For example, if the total amount paid by a customer is $115 including GST, the flat-rate credit is $115 x 17/230 = $8.50. You must also provide a statement to the accommodation owner showing the flat-rate credits passed on to them. You need to do this at least once a month. The statement must show the accommodation owner the full amount of the flat-rate credit, it should not be reduced or offset by other fees or charges for services you provide to them. However, the statement can also show other payments made to the accommodation owner. Be careful to not pass on the flat-rate credit to GST-registered sellers. If a GST-registered seller incorrectly receives a flat-rate credit, they may be liable for penalties. You should have systems in place to record which accommodation owners are GST-registered and which are not. Accommodation owners need to give you their name, IRD number and GST registration status - including any changes to this. You can contact us to verify the GST registration status provided to you by an accommodation owner. Similarly, we may tell you that an accommodation owner is GST-registered. If we do this, you will need to act on our notification as soon as practicable. Assisting accommodation owners to opt-out There are opt-out rules for large GST-registered accommodation owners. Accommodation owners who opt-out remain responsible for the GST obligations including providing taxable supply information to guests. Where a GST registered accommodation owner has opted out, the online marketplace does not need to collect and pay the GST to us. You may need to assist an accommodation owner with coming to an agreement with an online marketplace to opt-out. Listing intermediaries cannot opt-out themselves under these rules. An accommodation owner can opt-out if 1 of the following applies. • They are a non-individual and make more than NZ$500,000 of supplies in a 12-month period. They need to tell the online marketplace in writing, for example by email, they are opting out. Online marketplaces will have different methods for doing this. • They list or can reasonably expect to list more than 2,000 nights of accommodation on an online marketplace in a 12-month period. They can enter into an agreement with the online marketplace to opt out. • They make more than $60,000 of supplies of accommodation in a hostel or motel in a 12-month period. They can enter into an agreement with the online marketplace to opt out. To qualify, they must have been registered for GST before 1 April 2024, and provide accommodation through both an online marketplace and directly to their guests. The 2,000-night threshold can be satisfied by a group of related companies. But it is not possible to combine accommodation nights across multiple online marketplaces. In addition, a listing intermediary cannot choose to opt out on the basis that they manage a number of apartments owned by separate accommodation owners that in total would meet this threshold. Note: For an opt-out agreement to be valid, there must be a written agreement the accommodation owner will be responsible for the tax obligations under the GST Act for the supplies of listed services. This includes: • providing guests with taxable supply information, if required • identifying the accommodation owner as the supplier • filing GST returns • collecting and paying GST to us. Keep all information relating to opt-outs in your records. Choosing to collect and pay GST In most cases the online marketplace will collect and pay GST of 15% on accommodation (and any closely connected services) supplied through their marketplace. This includes any services you supply to the guest for a fee through the marketplace, such as cleaning or providing fresh linen. However, you can enter into an agreement with the online marketplace stating you will collect and pay GST of 15% on the supplies. To be able to do this, you must: • be a New Zealand tax resident • list the accommodation provided by the accommodation owner on more than one online marketplace • use an electronic system that automatically manages guests’ bookings. Common examples include Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that send information between your system and the online marketplace, or property management software you use to manage the bookings. 3 The online marketplace will remain responsible for providing the guest with taxable supply information. Receiving payments from guests If you receive the payment from the guest, but you have not entered into an agreement with the online marketplace to collect and pay the GST, you will need to pass on to the online marketplace the funds necessary for it to pay the GST. Completing your GST return If you have not entered into an agreement with an online marketplace to collect and pay GST, you will be treated for GST purposes as supplying to the online marketplace the accommodation services provided by the accommodation owners. These services should be treated as zero-rated supplies in your GST returns. To do this, if you are filing using myIR, choose the total sales and purchases filing option. Include the value of listed services before GST in both total sales and income and zero-rated supplies. If you are filing using a paper return, include the value of listed services before GST in box 5 and 6. If you supply additional services to guests, such as charging a booking fee or providing cleaning services directly to the guest, these should also be included as total sales and income and zero-rated supplies. You should continue to include income from other services made to the accommodation owners (for example management fees) as total sales and income. To claim the flat-rate credits in your GST return using myIR, select yes for credit adjustments, and include them as other adjustments (box 13 on a paper return). You can continue to claim GST on the costs you incur. Property Manager is a listing intermediary. It lists a property on an online marketplace on behalf of an accommodation owner, Tana. The property is in New Zealand and is available for holiday accommodation. Tana charges $100 per night. Property Manager charges the guest a fee of $20 per stay for cleaning, and also charges Tana a fee of $15 for its property management services. Property Manager has not entered into an agreement with the online marketplace to collect and pay GST. Property Manager’s GST return includes the following information. • $100 for the supply of accommodation as total sales and income and zero-rated supplies (box 5 and 6). • $20 for cleaning as total sales and income and zero-rated supplies (box 5 and 6). • $15 for property management fee, a standard rated supply, as total sales and income (box 5). • $8.50 for flat-rate credit (8.5% of $100 paid by the guest to Tana) as a credit adjustment (box 13). • Any costs incurred in making these supplies can also be claimed as total purchases and expenses (box 11). Example – Listing intermediary’s GST return If you agree with an online marketplace that you will collect and pay the GST, you need to include the total sales from listed services including 15% GST, as total sales and income. Include these with all other supplies you make such as services provided directly to guests. There is no separate box for listed services.

GST paid on deposit
===================

2006 case note - Correctness of the CIR's assessment disallowing the refund of output tax originally paid by each disputant on deposits later refunded to them.

Case

TRA No. 018/05, Decision No. 8/2006

Legislative References

GST Act 1985; Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The disputants, registered on a payments basis, entered into sale and purchase agreements to buy a number of apartments. The disputants then entered into sale and purchase agreements to on-sell the apartments to one of three purchaser companies, registered on an invoice basis. Deposits were paid to the disputants by the three companies when GST refunds were paid. The disputants paid output tax on the deposits. The vendor of the first sale and purchase agreement cancelled the contracts with the disputants for non performance. The disputants filed returns claiming back the output tax paid on the deposits. The Commissioner disallowed the claim.

### Background

This case is concerned with the application of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the GST Act") in relation to a property transaction entered into by the disputants. The cases that are the subject of this litigation concern a series of interlocking events which exploit a timing mismatch arising from GST registration on an invoice basis compared to another on a payments basis. In particular, this challenge concerns the correctness of the Commissioner's assessment disallowing the refund of output tax originally paid by each disputant on deposits which were later refunded to them.

### The facts

The disputants are 30 companies ("the disputants"). Mr X was the director of all disputants until he was adjudicated bankrupt in May 2001.

The disputants were each incorporated with 1,000 shares and a capital value of $100 on 30 April 1997. They were registered for GST as "property traders" on a payments basis. Two days prior to incorporation the disputants entered into Sale and Purchase Agreements with a developer, ("vendor") for 45 apartments. No tax invoices were issued.

On the same day the purchase agreements were entered into, each of the disputants entered into agreements to sell the apartment to one of three companies, A Ltd, B Ltd and C Ltd ("the three final purchasers"). The agreements contained conditions for deposits payable to the vendors. $100 of this deposit was to be paid upon execution with the remainder being paid on or before 30 June 1997. The balance was to be paid on the date of settlement being 1 May 2007. A tax invoice was issued by each of the 30 disputants to one of the three final purchasers.

The three final purchasers filed GST returns claiming input credits in respect of the apartments purchased. Upon receiving the refunds, the three final purchasers paid the remaining deposit to the 30 disputants.

On 30 September 1997, the 30 disputants filed GST returns for the periods ending 31 August 1997. They each claimed GST input tax totalling $0 and returned GST output tax totalling $152,756 based on the payment of the second instalment of the deposit which the 30 disputants received from the three final purchasers.

On 17 September 1999 the vendor cancelled its agreements with the 30 disputants for non performance. On 4 July 2001 the 30 disputants filed GST returns claiming back the output tax they had earlier paid on the sales to the three final purchasers.

### Decision

The TRA makes it clear from the outset that the scheme was one designed to take advantage of the timing mismatch in the GST legislation which it viewed as unacceptable. The disputants argued that the forfeited deposits became an item of damages in its hands and therefore was not subject to GST. At the time of cancellation the purchaser lost the right to retain the input credit paid to it. The vendor's liability for output tax was then cancelled and it was entitled to a refund of the GST paid.

The Authority went on to state that the disputants were never entitled to a refund of the GST paid by them on the sales to the end purchaser. The Authority considered GST was always properly payable, and the fact that a series of events had intervened making it impossible for the disputants to perfect the overall scheme of arrangements for the purchase of the apartments did not make it less so.

In addition, the Authority considered that from its inception this was a scheme which blatantly exploited provisions of the GST regime enacted to provide some administrative relief for smaller taxpayers from the burden of GST compliance.

This arrangement sought to take advantage of the timing mismatch possible in the relevant section. The primary motivation in entering the transaction was not the making of taxable supplies but the derivation of large input tax credits. The input tax refunds were then used to pay the deposit to the 0 disputants. The payment of the output tax on these deposits could not be viewed separately from the other transactions that made up the arrangement as a whole.

The Commissioner sought to counteract the tax advantage by disallowing the refunds claimed by the 0 disputants. To permit these refunds would be to allow the disputants to benefit from an arrangement designed to defeat the intent and application of the GST Act. Therefore, the scheme in this case was void against the Commissioner pursuant to section 76.

The Judge confirmed the Commissioner's decision in each of the cases before the Authority.

[Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-budget-measures-act-2010 "Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010")

GST rate increase
=================

Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 increases rate of GST to 15% from 1 Oct 2010.

_**Sections 8, 10, 12, 21CB, 21F, 21I(4B), 46, 78 and 78B of the GST Act 1985; sections MD 3, ME 1, MF 4B, MF 4C, MF 4D, MF 4E of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 13 and 183AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

The rate of goods and services tax (GST) will increase from 12.5% to 15% from 1 October 2010, as part of a switch in the tax mix from income tax to consumption tax announced in Budget 2010. The GST rate was last increased in 1989.

New Zealand relies heavily on income taxes in order to fund expenditure. Income taxes may, however, be harmful for efficiency and growth. Taxes on consumption, such as GST, tend to be less harmful to growth as, unlike income taxes, they do not apply to savings and, therefore, do not discourage this activity. A switch from income tax towards GST can, therefore, boost incentives to save and encourage economic growth.

The merits of changing the tax mix were discussed in the report of Victoria University of Wellington's Tax Working Group, _A Tax System for New Zealand's Future_ released in January this year.

### Background

#### _How will it be calculated?_

Businesses and organisations registered for GST will be required to account for GST at the new rate of 15% from 1 October 2010. The rate of increase will also apply to goods imported on or after 1 October 2010.

The new tax fraction (the tax rate divided by the sum of 100 plus the tax rate) used to calculate GST will be 3/23. This fraction can be applied to the price of goods or services to see how much GST is included in the price. For example, if the cost of a fridge is $2,000 inclusive of GST, the GST included in the price will be $260.87[1](#2)

($2,000 x 3) ÷ 23

#### _Altering systems and prices_

Businesses will need to alter their systems to incorporate the new rate. They may also need to alter the prices they charge for the goods and services they supply to cover the increased GST liability. This may affect businesses' current stocks and transactions as well as forward orders or deferred supplies.

There are rules within the GST Act to deal with transitional matters arising from a rate change. These rules provide for prices in existing contracts to be increased by the amount of GST in certain circumstances, and fees and other charges set by Act or regulation are automatically increased by the amount of the GST rate increase.

The legislation ensures that government grants and subsidies are not automatically increased when there is a change in the GST rate. Instead, the relevant administering public authorities will be considering the implications for grant recipients on a case-by-case basis over the coming months.

#### _Compensation for price increases_

The increase in GST will affect everyone due to a rise in most prices. Statistics New Zealand has estimated that overall prices will increase by about 2.0%. To illustrate this - a $100 item (before GST) will increase in price from $112.50 (current rate of GST) to $115 (the new rate). This is an increase of 2.22%. However, 9% of spending is on items that do not incur GST. When these items are taken into account the overall price impact drops back to 2.02%. Items that are exempt from GST include rent for private premises, mortgage payments, school donations and some credit service charges.

Compensation for price increases has been provided in a range of cases, including in relation to tax credits. Immediate compensation is being provided to people receiving Working for Families tax credits. The Family Tax Credit and the Minimum Family Tax Credit will increase by 2.02% from 1 October 2010. After this increase, the automatic indexation of the Family Tax Credit will continue. That is, if the cumulative increase in the CPI since the last adjustment to the Family Tax Credit (in October 2008) is greater than 5% in December 2010, the credit will be adjusted for the movement in the CPI since that time. However, this adjustment for inflation will exclude the 2.02% increase already provided on 1 October 2010.

#### _Filing returns_

As happened in 1989 when GST was last increased, there will be an effect on businesses' return filing. In particular, registered persons will continue to file GST returns at their normal times, but if the return period straddles 1 October 2010 the return will need to be split into two parts - the first covering the period up to 30 September and the second covering the remainder of the return period from 1 October. A special return will be provided for this purpose.

To simplify the accounting for those who return GST on either a payments or hybrid basis, the new 15% rate will apply to all payments made or received from 1 October. An adjustment based on the registered person's creditors and debtors as at 30 September 2010 will ensure that supplies provided before 1 October but which have not been paid for by that date will in effect be subject to the old lower rate. A similar adjustment mechanism applied in 1989.

If a taxpayer's GST taxable period spans the GST rate change and the taxpayer is required to make a combined GST and provisional tax payment, the transitional return will provide guidance on how to make the combined payment. Advice will also be provided on how to account for the GST on FBT, entertainment tax and other deemed supplies during the transition.

#### _Time of supply rules_

The GST Act contains rules that determine the point in time when a GST-registered person must recognise a supply of goods and services that give rise to an output tax liability. In most cases this will be when the supplier issues an invoice or receives payment. The rules attempt to approximate when a transaction has been concluded and economic control of the goods and services has passed from the supplier to the recipient.[2](#2)

In general, the normal time of supply rules will apply over the transition period. Reliance on the normal time of supply rules may allow businesses to bring forward invoicing so they can take advantage of the old lower GST rate. In excessive cases the general anti-avoidance provision in the GST Act may be applicable if it is clearly evident that businesses are restructuring their business practices to bring forward a material number of transactions.

#### _Communication_

Inland Revenue will be providing explanatory material to taxpayers on the changed requirements and transition arrangements.

#### _Legislative changes_

Some minor legislative changes have been made to the transitional provisions to remove interpretative ambiguity, to cover deemed supplies and to simplify the Act's return filing and record-keeping requirements for returns that straddle the rate-change date. There are also changes to the penalties rules to provide remission of late payment and late filing penalties and use-of-money interest in certain circumstances. These changes, which were included in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010, are explained below.

### Key features

*   The rate of GST will increase to 15% from 1 October 2010. All other key aspects of the GST rules are unaffected. The goods and services subject to GST are not being altered.
*   The transitional rules that applied in 1989 will, with some minor modification, apply to this latest rate change.

### Application date

All changes apply from 1 October 2010.

### Detailed analysis

The minor legislative changes to the GST transitional provisions are:

#### _Rate references_

The rate specified in the GST Act has been amended so that businesses and organisations registered for GST are required to account for GST at the new rate of 15% from 1 October 2010. This also applies to goods imported on or after 1 October 2010. Accordingly, the rate references in sections 8(1) and 12(1) have been changed from "12.5" to "15". The rate reference in section 10(6), which sets the GST rate charged on goods and services provided to individuals in long-term commercial accommodation, has also been changed, from "7.5" to "9".

#### _Contract prices_

Some commentators suggested that there was interpretative uncertainty over whether contract prices expressed as "inclusive of GST" could be increased by the amount of the GST rate increase. Given that many contracts are expressed on a GST-inclusive basis, this issue has been put beyond doubt by amending the relevant section of the GST Act. The policy intent is clear that contract prices expressed as GST-inclusive should be able to be adjusted.

The uncertainty arises from the words in section 78(2) of the GST Act "or where the alteration in the law has been taken into account". Accordingly, these words have been removed.

#### _Deemed supplies_

The GST Act deems supplies to take place in certain situations, such as when there is a fringe benefit, entertainment expenditure and change of use. Since the last GST rate increase in 1989, a number of changes have been made to these time of supply rules, aimed at reducing compliance costs by enabling taxpayers to file less frequently.

In the absence of further legislative change, an unintentional result would have been that when the GST rate was increased, some transactions that took place before the rate-change date would have been subject to the new higher rate, in effect applying the rate change in advance of 1 October 2010. Accordingly, additional transitional provisions ensure that the old rate applies in these cases, so that registered persons are neither disadvantaged nor advantaged by the rate change. These changes are outlined below.

This issue does not arise for FBT as under the FBT time of supply rule the supply is treated as taking place at the time the fringe benefit is or is deemed to be provided or granted. This means that the GST on fringe benefits provided before 1 October will be charged at 12.5%.

_Entertainment expenditure_

In the absence of the additional transitional provisions, that part of entertainment expenditure that was precluded from being deducted would have been subject to the higher rate of GST as the supply would normally have been recognised on the date the registered person furnished their income tax return for the tax year, irrespective of when within the year the entertainment took place.

New section 21I(4B) of the GST Act provides a registered person with the option, for the 2010-11 tax year, of using the normal time of supply rule applicable to the deemed supply, or treating the entertainment expenditure incurred before 1 October 2010 as being supplied on 30 September 2010. The expenses incurred over the rest of the tax year would be recognised on the date the registered person furnishes their income tax return for the 2010-11 tax year.

_Change-of-use adjustments_

Supplies are deemed to occur when there is a change of use. Goods and services intended originally for business purposes may be used for making non-taxable supplies (that is, for exempt or private purposes). In this case output tax is payable. Conversely, goods and services intended originally for exempt or private purposes may be used in the registered person's business. In this case there is a deduction from output tax (calculated as the tax fraction applied to the lower of the market value or cost price of the good or service).

Some registered persons will be making the respective output tax or deduction from output tax in a period other than the taxable period in which there is a change of use. For example, many registered persons make the tax adjustment after the end of the tax year as part of finalising their annual accounts - the adjustments for 2010 would therefore be made in mid-2011. In this situation, and in the absence of additional transitional provisions, the higher GST rate may have applied even when the change of use took place before 1 October 2010.[3](#3)

To ensure the old rate applies in such instances, the legislation has been amended, with regard to a deduction from output tax, to require a registered person to identify items that changed to a business use before 1 October 2010 and to apply a rate of 12.5% to them even if the deduction is made on or after 1 October. The legislative change makes it clear that the tax fraction mentioned in section 21F(1) is, in such cases, the tax fraction at the time the goods were acquired by the registered person.

Similarly, when output tax is required to be paid as a result of the change of use, the legislation explicitly provides the registered person with the additional option of identifying items that changed to a private use before 1 October 2010 and applying a rate of 12.5% to them, even if the output tax is attributed on or after 1 October 2010.

These changes are covered by the definition of "COU tax fraction" and new section 21CB.

#### _Return filing_

When there is a rate change, the transitional mechanism in section 78B avoids the need for special time-of-supply rules for registered persons returning GST on a payments or hybrid basis. The adjustment also affects persons on an invoice basis who have purchased second-hand goods for their business which meet the "qualifying supplies" definition. All the amounts that they pay or receive are accounted for at the new rate but with an adjustment to recognise the fact that the time of supply for some of the transactions would have been before the rate change date.

Basically, the adjustment mechanism takes the difference between a registered person's debtors and creditors immediately before the rate change and multiplies it by the difference between the old and new tax fractions. If the result is a positive amount (that is, creditors on hand exceed debtors on hand) it is treated as output tax in the return period. If it is negative (that is, debtors exceed creditors), the amount must be set off against GST liabilities in the preceding return period, with any balance being carried forward for use in the current return period, and so on.

Some minor legislative changes have been made to these rules to simplify the Act's return filing and record-keeping requirements for returns that straddle the rate change date.

The legislative changes are:

*   The requirement (in former section 78B(2)(b)) that the registered person furnish the form on which they do their adjustment calculation to the Commissioner, has been being removed. Instead, registered persons only need to retain the form as part of their records, and include the adjustment with any other GST adjustments relevant to that return period. As a consequence of the removal of section 78B(2)(b), section 78B(4) which cross-referred to section 78B(2)(b), has been amended to include the references that were in section 78B(2)(b)(i) and (ii).
*   Any excess credits can now be offset against the registered person's other tax liabilities, or even refunded.

#### _Application of penalties and use-of-money interest_

New section 183AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the automatic remission of late payment and late filing penalties and use-of-money interest in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are:

*   that the lateness in filing or paying is reasonably attributable to the change in the GST rate (for example, the required systems changes to accommodate the new rate have not been able to be made in time); and
*   the registered person has made reasonable efforts to comply and, therefore, shortfall penalties such as lack of reasonable care, would not be applicable.

If a shortfall penalty is imposed, the registered person is not eligible for the remission of late payment/late filing penalties and use-of-money interest under the proposed new remission provision. The remission is for a limited time, focusing on the transitional return period(s). Inland Revenue's media release of 27 May 2010 provides further detail.

Further legislative changes to section 139B of the Tax Administration Act ensure that the remitted penalties do not affect the late payment penalty grace period. That grace period allows a taxpayer to make an occasional error without the late payment penalty being imposed.

#### _Legislative adjustment of tax credits for price increases_

These adjustments are provided through several amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 - see amended sections MD 3 and ME 1 and new sections MF 4D and MF 4E. Sections MF 4B and MF 4C have been repealed as a consequence.

* * *

1 The tax fraction under a 12.5% GST rate is 1/9, calculated as 12.5/112.5. Under that scenario, the GST is $2,000/9 = $222.22.

2 Although the time-of-supply rules determine when GST-registered persons are required to recognise a liability for GST, the accounting basis adopted by the registered person can alter the taxable period in which that liability must be disclosed to Inland Revenue.

3 This means, for example, that when a deduction in output tax is required, the deduction from output tax would be at the rate of 15% even though output tax would have been originally paid at 12.5% when the good or service was purchased.

GST refunds and section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985
=================================================================

2009 case note – CIR satisfied obligations under section 46 of the GST Act when investigation notice issued within the prescribed time limits in section 46(5).

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Contract Pacific Limited

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The Commissioner had satisfied his obligations under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 when he issued an investigation notice within the prescribed time limits in section 46(5).

### Impact of decision

Where the Commissioner has issued a notice to investigate within the time limits set out under section 46(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"), he will not need to issue any requests for information (which form part of that investigation) within the time limits set out in section 46(4) to ensure the Commissioner maintains his authority to withhold the refund while he completes that investigation.

### Facts

At all relevant times, Contract Pacific Ltd ("Contract Pacific") carried on the business of an inbound tour operator, selling New Zealand-based holiday packages to overseas wholesalers who then sold to overseas retailers. Those retailers in turn sold to overseas-based holidaymakers who were to visit New Zealand.

Between July 1993 and April 1999, Contract Pacific included goods and services tax ("GST") in the sale prices for the services it sold to overseas wholesalers while other inbound tour operators did not.

In May 1999, the law was changed to remove any ambiguity over liability to include GST in the sale prices for New Zealand-based services sold to overseas persons for the purpose of on-sale to New Zealand-bound visitors.

On 26 June 2000, Contract Pacific filed a GST return in which it sought a readjustment and refund of the GST it had paid between 1 July 1993 and 30 April 1999.

On 10 July 2000, the Commissioner advised that the GST refund had been withheld pending investigation of the readjustment claim.

Through an administrative error, a notice of assessment and refund cheque were issued on 5 February 2001. On 9 February 2001, the Commissioner became aware of the error and took steps to stop payment on the refund cheque.

On 2 April 2001, the Government introduced the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill ("the Bill"). On 2 July 2001 a notice of assessment was sent to Contract Pacific which disallowed the credit adjustment and consequential refund it sought.

On 24 October 2001, the Bill came into force as the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 ("2001 Act"), with retrospective effect. The general effect of the new legislation (section 241) was to make clear there was and always had been liability to pay GST on the services to overseas persons. A savings provision was enacted that exempted a small category of persons from this effect. Contract Pacific would come within this savings provision if the circumstances of receiving the refund cheque meant it had been "paid a refund".

In April 2005, Contract Pacific wrote to the Commissioner requesting payment of $6,281,767 plus interest, being the balance of the stopped refund cheque after a facilitation fee credit adjustment was deducted. The Commissioner rejected the claim.

### High Court judgment

The High Court ((2009) 24 NZTC 23,092) confirmed that the Commissioner had issued a notice under section 46(2)(a) of the GST Act, notifying his intention to investigate the matter, and had done so within the 15-day time limit prescribed in section 46(5). However, the High Court held that as the Commissioner had also made requests for information pursuant to that investigation, and these were made outside the prescribed time limits in section 46(4), he had "lost his authority to withhold the disputed refund".

The High Court also held that, given it was concluded that the cheque issued by the Commissioner was valuable consideration, the position was "unaffected by section 241(6) of the 2001 Act". The High Court did conclude, however, that in any event, under the common law, the cheque was a "payment" for the purposes of section 241(6)(a).

The Commissioner appealed the decision. Both parties agreed to limit the appeal to two issues.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.

_**Issue one - section 46 of the GST Act**_

The Court of Appeal concluded that the Commissioner, when investigating Contract Pacific's GST return, had satisfied the time limits contained in section 46(5) of the GST Act and therefore there was no obligation to make a refund.

In particular, the Court concluded that when the Commissioner issues a notice of investigation within the 15-day period:

> \[37\] ... that investigation is not subject to any limitation, curtailment or restriction. If, in the course of the investigation, instead of or as well as seeking submissions, the Commissioner requires additional information, he can ask for it and such request will not engage section 46(2)(b).
> 
> \[38\] It is artificial to consider that, if the investigation route under section 46(2)(a) is embarked upon, the registered person is immune from information requests except in the 15 day period or subsequent 15 day periods following the provision of information. That is not what the words say and such an interpretation would be most impractical.

The Court of Appeal confirmed that some investigations are complex and therefore require a number of information requests, whereas others will only require additional information that has been overlooked.

The Court held that "it is not sensible for these two different kinds of inquiries to be governed by the same approach. The more expansive must necessarily include the narrower process".

_**Issue two - section 241(6)of the 2001 Act - the "paid" point**_

The Court did not consider this issue on the basis that the parties had agreed that the second issue was unnecessary for the Court to consider should it find in favour of the Commissioner on issue one.

GST rules clarified for non-profit bodies
=========================================

**15 May 2018**

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash has signalled a law change to clarify GST rules around the sale of assets by non-profit bodies.

“The GST treatment of non-profit organisations differs from other entities,” says Mr Nash.

“Non-profits can register for GST and claim GST refunds on most of their expenses even if their turnover is below the $60,000 threshold for registration. In many cases non-profit bodies do not pay much GST on their activities.

“In turn, when a GST-registered body sells an asset for which it has claimed GST expenses, it must pay GST on the income from the sale. Inland Revenue has applied this rule since GST was first introduced in 1986.

“Revenue officials have recently been advised of a new legal interpretation of this rule which exposes the tax system to substantial potential losses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Government will legislate to clarify the GST rules.

“The new interpretation suggests that where a non-profit body sells an asset that is not connected to a fee-earning activity, the organisation can claim back the GST on the costs relating to that asset, but does not have to pay GST on its sale. This could also be the case if a non-profit body receives an insurance pay-out on an asset, such as a building. An insurance pay-out is treated as a sale for GST purposes.

“The new interpretation is not consistent with the way the GST rules have been applied and understood in the past. If GST expenses have been claimed by a non-profit body in relation to an asset, GST should apply to the asset when it is sold or there is an equivalent event, such as an insurance pay-out.

“The tax system is based on fairness, and being simple and efficient to operate. The new interpretation threatens those principles and the Government will move to restore certainty.

“Inland Revenue has released an issues paper seeking public feedback on the issue. We want to hear from organisations who currently hold affected assets. Non-profit bodies like charities do marvellous work and we recognise their valuable contribution. But fairness applies to all taxpayers,” Mr Nash says. 

The proposed new GST rule will apply from 15 May with a savings provision to preserve the tax positions taken by non-profit bodies before that date.

The issues paper is available on the IRD website [http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/)

The deadline for public submissions is 15 June 2018

GST Tax Avoidance
=================

2007 case note – input/output tax constituted tax avoidance - property transactions, deferrable contracts, credit contracts, contract cancellation, objective test.

Case

Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and services tax 1985

### Summary

The taxpayer had claimed GST input tax credits on a total of 117 property transactions. Payment to the vendor was by way of a small deposit with the remainder payable on settlement. The difference in registration types (payment and invoice) between the parties saw the taxpayer claiming an input credit on the entire purchase price whilst the vendor only paid output tax on the deposit paid. The Commissioner considered the arrangement was set up for the tax advantages it could obtain and alleged tax avoidance under section 76 of the GST Act. The TRA, High Court and Court of Appeal all agreed with the Commissioner.

### Background

This was an application for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal ("CA") decision upholding the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") and High Court ("HC") decisions finding that the Commissioner was correct in disallowing input tax credits claimed by Ch'elle Properties Ltd ("Ch'elle").

### Facts

In 1996 and 1997, the taxpayer incorporated a total of 114 companies, all registered for GST purposes on a payment basis.

A friend of the taxpayer's former wife registered Ch'elle in July of 1998 and for GST purposes, it was registered on a monthly invoice basis. The taxable activity was "property trader".

On 5 November 1998, each of the 114 taxpayer companies entered into conditional contracts to purchase from Waverly Developments Ltd a lot in a subdivision in Papakura for $70,000.00. Each contract provided for a $10 deposit on execution with the remainder of the deposit to be payable on the date for settlement specified in the contracts which was 31 August 1999.

On 21 May 1999 Ch'elle entered into conditional contracts with the 114 taxpayer companies to purchase these properties for a total price of $80 million; an average of about $700,000.00 per contract.

Settlement was deferred for between 10 to 20 years. An initial deposit of $10 was payable on execution, with the balance of the deposit ($29,990) being payable subsequently. The vendor did not hold the deposit as a stakeholder but, during the deferred period, the vendor was to construct a house on each section. Each of the vendors issued an invoice to Ch'elle for the total ultimate price.

In June 1999 Ch'elle filed a GST return for the period ending 31 May 1999 claiming input tax credits of $398,333.00 in relation to 13 property transactions, including 10 of the 114 transactions. On 20 October 1999, Ch'elle filed a further GST return for the remaining 104 properties, claiming $9 million in input tax credits based on the estimated market value on the respective settlement dates 10 to 20 years into the future.

The Commissioner issued notices disallowing the claims and all 114 contracts between Waverly Developments and the companies were cancelled for failure to settle on the stipulated date of October 1999.

The TRA, HC and CA all considered the scheme constituted tax avoidance pursuant to section 76 of the GST Act. The HC and CA considered the test of avoidance under that section was an objective one and that while timing mismatches were provided for in the Act, these transactions exploited that provision and defeated the intent and purpose of the Act.

### Decision

The Supreme Court considered it unnecessary to express any view on the merits of Ch'elle's arguments that 1) the CA erred in finding it was unnecessary for the Commissioner to show an intention to defeat the intent and application of the Act and 2) that an arrangement can defeat the intent and application of the act only if there is a tension between the commercial and juristic nature of the transactions, on the basis the TRA had made factual findings that Ch'elle did have an intention to defeat the intent and application of the Act.

The Supreme Court also considered Ch'elle's third ground of appeal that it did not gain a "tax advantage" equally as hopeless. The definition of that term included "any increase in the entitlement of any registered person to a refund of tax". Ch'elle clearly came within this definition.

GST treatment of funding provided to Treaty of Waitangi claimants by the Crown through the Office of Treaty Settlements
=======================================================================================================================

QB (Nov 2006) finds funding provided to Treaty claimants is not subject to GST as there is no supply of goods/services, it's not 'consideration' or a grant/subsidy.

### Sections 5(6D) and 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985-definitions of "consideration", "goods" and "services"

#### Question

In the Interpretation Statement on _Treaty of Waitangi Settlements-GST Treatment_ (published in TIB Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002)) it was considered that redress under a Treaty of Waitangi ("Treaty") settlement was not subject to goods and services tax (GST). The Commissioner has now been asked whether GST is chargeable on funding provided by the Crown through the Office of Treaty Settlements ("OTS") to claimants for negotiation costs ("claimant funding"). (This item does not address the GST treatment of supplies received by claimants that are paid for out of claimant funding.)

#### Answer

Claimant funding is not subject to GST, because:

*   Claimant groups do not supply goods or services to the Crown in the course of negotiating a Treaty settlement;  
      
    
*   Claimant funding does not constitute "consideration" within the statutory definition as there is an insufficient relationship between claimant funding and any supply that might be made by a claimant group to the Crown; and  
      
    
*   Claimant funding is not in the nature of a grant or subsidy in terms of section 5(6D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("the Act").  
    

#### Analysis

#### Background

The Crown accepts that historical breaches of the Treaty have occurred and has indicated its willingness to enter into negotiations to settle claims in respect of such Treaty breaches. The Crown provides a contribution (through the OTS) towards costs incurred by claimant groups in connection with the negotiation of the settlement of such claims. Funding is provided for negotiation costs such as rent, administration, travel, accommodation and communication costs, fees for legal, financial or other advice, negotiators' fees and hui costs. Claimants may decide to undertake additional research to establish a particular aspect of their claim. However, the Crown does not provide funding for research. The Crown may commission research if additional research is required in order to enable settlement to be reached. Claimant funding is not provided to a claimant group unless the group's representatives establish that they have a mandate to represent the group. The representatives of the claimant group receive claimant funding on behalf of the group.

Claimant funding does not necessarily cover all the negotiation costs incurred by a claimant group. The amount of the funding approved by the Crown depends on the size and complexity of the claim, and whether any features of the claimant group could make negotiation and consultation with its members more difficult and expensive (for example, whether the members of the claimant group are in strong agreement about the proposed negotiations, the size of the claimant group and how scattered its members are, and whether hui are required).

The timing of instalments of claimant funding is linked to milestones in the negotiation progress (that is, Mandate, Terms of Negotiation, Formal Negotiation to Deed of Settlement and Ratification). The Crown advises claimant groups of the funding allocated to each milestone once Cabinet has approved the overall amount of claimant funding to be given to a group. Payments are made by instalments of no more than $50,000 each. Claimants must provide copies of itemised invoices for negotiation costs incurred by the claimants to enable the OTS to establish that the funding has been used for negotiation costs. The claimants must also undertake an annual audit and review to:

*   Provide verification that the correct accounting standards have been used and procedures maintained and that the claimants' financial statements represent an accurate view of transactions that have occurred for the period; and  
      
    
*   Ensure claimant funding has been used on valid negotiation-related expenses.  
    

Claimant funding is in addition to any financial redress under the Deed of Settlement between the Crown and the claimant group. It is provided because in the absence of funding by the Crown, it may be difficult to achieve settlement or the settlement reached may not be lasting.

##### Imposition of GST

Under section 8(1) of the Act, GST is imposed on the supply of goods or services in New Zealand by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person by reference to the value of the supply. The value of a supply of goods or services is the "consideration" for the supply: section 10(2) of the Act.

Claimant groups may be registered persons. A supply of goods or services by a claimant group could be a supply made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the claimant group.

##### Whether claimant groups supply goods or services to the Crown

Claimant groups do not supply any goods in the course of negotiating a Treaty settlement. Claimant groups may transfer property to the Crown under the final Deed of Settlement signed on the completion of the negotiations. However, none of the agreements entered into in the course of settlement negotiations (the Deed of Mandate, Terms of Negotiation or Heads of Agreement) involves the transfer of property by the claimant group.

"Services" means some action that helps or benefits the recipient: _Case S65_ (1996) 17 NZTC 7,408; _F B Duvall Ltd v CIR_ (1997) 18 NZTC 3,470. Claimants may undertake the following activities in connection with the negotiation of a Treaty settlement:

*   The preparation for, and conduct of, negotiations with the Crown (including mandating, agreement on the terms of negotiation, preparation of a negotiation brief and formal negotiations);  
      
    
*   A forbearance not to pursue claims through the courts or the Waitangi Tribunal or by other means while in negotiation;  
      
    
*   Research (additional to research the Waitangi Tribunal or the Crown Forestry Rental Trust or the Crown carries out) to support its claims;  
      
    
*   The provision of invoices relating to negotiation costs and audited financial statements accounting for the use of claimant funding.  
    

The pursuit of a Treaty settlement is an activity carried on for the claimant group's benefit, rather than an activity carried on for the Crown's benefit. Mandating establishes that the claimant group's representatives have the authority to represent that group in negotiations with the Crown, and is undertaken for the purpose of enabling a claimant group to initiate negotiations with the Crown. The agreement that negotiations will continue only if the parties do not pursue claims through the courts, the Waitangi Tribunal or by other means during negotiations is part of the framework for Treaty negotiations and relates to the process for negotiating settlement. If a claimant group carries out additional research, it does so in order to obtain evidence to support its claim against the Crown. The carrying out of additional research is part of a process of seeking compensation from the Crown and is incidental to the pursuit of redress from the Crown. Compliance with accounting requirements is not sought as an end in itself and is incidental to the negotiation of a Treaty settlement that is not itself a service. Viewed as a whole, the claimants' activities are directed at obtaining compensation for the Crown's Treaty breaches. Such activities are undertaken to recover compensation from the Crown rather than for the Crown's benefit and do not constitute a service provided by the claimants to the Crown.

Therefore, the Commissioner does not consider that claimant groups provide either goods or services to the Crown in the course of negotiating a Treaty settlement.

##### Whether claimant funding is "consideration" within the statutory definition

Also, for claimant funding to be subject to GST, it must be "consideration" for a supply of goods or services. The definition of "consideration" in section 2(1) of the Act reads as follows:

"Consideration", in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body:

A distinction is drawn between a payment in respect of the payee's taxable activity and a payment that is consideration for a supply of goods and services: _Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan_ (1996) 17 NZTC 12,636; _NZ Refining Co Ltd v CIR_ (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187 (CA). For a payment to be "consideration" within the statutory definition a sufficient relationship must exist between the making of the payment and the supply of goods or services. An expectation that the recipient of the payment would carry out a certain activity is not enough. It is not sufficient that the person who receives the payment carries out some activity that has the effect of benefiting either the person making the payment or some other person. It is also not sufficient that the payment enables the recipient to carry on an activity. The transaction must involve reciprocal obligations between the payer and payee: _NZ Refining Co Ltd v CIR; Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,075.

Hence, it is not sufficient that the Crown agrees to provide claimant funding in the expectation that the claimants will begin and continue negotiations. It is also not sufficient that the claimants' activity in carrying out the negotiations provides a benefit to the Crown in facilitating Treaty settlements or that the provision of claimant funding enables the claimants to carry out negotiations.

The Commissioner considers that there is an insufficient relationship between claimant funding and any supply of goods or services that might be made by a claimant group to the Crown in negotiating a Treaty settlement with the Crown. The real and substantial relationship is between claimant funding and the Crown's Treaty breaches giving rise to the claims to which the negotiations relate. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that claimant funding is not "consideration" within the statutory definition.

##### Whether claimant funding is in the nature of a grant or subsidy

As claimant funding is provided by the Crown through the OTS, section 5(6D) of the Act potentially applies. If section 5(6D) applies, claimant funding would be deemed to be consideration for the supply of goods or services by a claimant group. For section 5(6D) to apply, claimant funding must be a "payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy" and must be paid to a claimant group "in relation to or in respect of" a taxable activity carried on by the claimant group.

The words "in relation to or in respect of" are words of the widest import: _Shell NZ Ltd v CIR_ (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303. It is possible that there may be some relationship between claimant funding and a taxable activity carried on by the claimant group.

The definition of "payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy" in section 5(6E) of the Act is not an exhaustive definition. Therefore, case law on the meaning of "grant or subsidy" is relevant to the interpretation of the phrase "payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy". The case law indicates that:

*   A "grant or subsidy" is financial assistance the Crown or a public body pays in money to promote some activity for the benefit of the community or a section of the community.  
      
    
*   A "grant or subsidy" is a gift in the sense that it is assistance the Crown provides gratuitously and voluntarily.  
      
    
*   A payment the Crown or a public authority makes merely for the purpose of discharging an obligation is not a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy.  
    

See _Placer Development Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia_ (1969) 121 CLR 353; _First Provincial Building Society v Commonwealth of Australia_ 95 ATC 4145; _GTE Sylvania v R_ \[1974\] CTC 751; _Reckitt & Colman Pty Ltd v FCT_ 4 ATR 501; _Director-General of Social Welfare v De Morgan; and Kena Kena Properties Ltd v A-G_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,433.

The Crown agrees to enter into negotiations to settle Treaty claims because it accepts that it has breached its obligations under the Treaty in respect of the claimants. The need for the claimants to incur costs in negotiating a settlement with the Crown is occasioned by the Crown's Treaty breaches. Claimant funding is provided by the Crown in order to enable the Crown to discharge obligations in respect of historical breaches of the Treaty that the Crown acknowledges did occur. The provision of claimant funding is occasioned by an obligation to provide redress for a loss suffered by the claimants as a consequence of the Crown's Treaty breaches and it is provided to facilitate settlement. Claimant funding compensates the claimants for costs that they incur directly as a result of the Crown's Treaty breaches.

A public benefit (in the form of better race relations and social harmony) may result from the settlement of long-standing Treaty grievances generally. However, the t claimant funding is provided in order to enable the Crown to discharge its obligations in respect of breaches of the Treaty.

Therefore, the Commissioner considers that for the purposes of section 5(6D) of the Act claimant funding is not a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy.

##### Surplus in claimant funding

It is possible that the amount of the claimant funding that the Crown has agreed to provide may exceed the negotiation costs the claimants have incurred. Any amount that the Crown has agreed to provide and that has not been spent when settlement is finalised is paid to the claimant group in addition to the Financial Redress (as defined in the Deed of Settlement). In legal terms, a surplus in claimant funding is not part of the Financial Redress. However, in practice, claimant funding is taken into account in developing the overall financial package offered to the claimants.

Whether or not claimant funding, which the Crown has agreed to provide, has been spent in full on negotiation costs, it is not "consideration" for GST purposes, because an insufficient relationship exists between a payment in respect of claimant funding and any goods or services a claimant group may potentially supply and is not a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy.

##### Advance payments of financial redress used for negotiation costs

The amount of claimant funding approved by Cabinet will not normally be increased. However, if the claimants' negotiation costs exceed the amount of the approved funding and good progress has been made in negotiations and settlement is close, the Crown may provide additional funds to the claimants. Additional funds are generally in the form of an advance out of any financial redress that may ultimately be agreed. Any advance payment is deducted from the final settlement amount paid under the Deed of Settlement. Financial and commercial redress under a Treaty settlement is not subject to GST (TIB Vol 14, No 9 (September 2002)). A pre-payment of financial redress is still financial redress and is not subject to GST. It is not relevant that an advance payment is used by a claimant group to meet negotiation costs.

GST treatment of services provided in making videos and films in New Zealand under contracts with non-residents
===============================================================================================================

QB (Feb 2007) considers the GST treatment of services provided in making videos and films in NZ under contracts with non-residents.

We have been asked what is the correct GST treatment of services provided in making videos and films in New Zealand under contracts with non-residents who are not in New Zealand . Would the GST treatment be different if a representative of the film buyer physically collects the completed film in New Zealand?

#### Background

A number of short films (which could include advertisements, documentaries, and background footage) are shot in New Zealand every year by filmmakers contracted directly by the overseas purchasers, who own the rights to the film, and who pay the filmmakers from overseas. The raw footage is then edited by a director and exported, usually in the form of a video cassette. The cassette is usually exported in a courier pack which has the appropriate postal customs declaration attached. Sometimes, for reasons of valuation or security, a representative of the non-resident purchaser will collect the cassette in New Zealand and take it out of the country as accompanying baggage.

#### Inland Revenue view:

Though the terms of contracts vary, in this scenario the fees paid to the New Zealand filmmakers are zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The services are supplied to non-residents who are not in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. There is judicial support for this approach in Case T 54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410. Although the legislation has since been changed by the enactment of section 11A (2) this will not affect the ability of the contractors to zero-rate their supplies.

We have considered whether the zero-rating is lost if a representative of the purchaser physically collects the cassette in New Zealand . Although the final product is reduced to the medium of a video cassette, which would generally be regarded as "goods" - and goods that are supplied to a non-resident who is in New Zealand usually cannot be zero-rated - it is Inland Revenue's view that the payment for this supply can still be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(k).

This is because Inland Revenue considers that the essential nature of the supply (again this would depend on the terms of the contract to produce the film to some extent) relates to the filming and editing services that had been performed before the buyer (or representative) arrived in New Zealand . Provided the representative does nothing materially more than take delivery of the completed work, their presence in New Zealand would be considered a "minor presence" and under section 11A(3) such a minor presence does not prevent zero-rating of services provided to non-residents. The same principle will apply to any exported screen production service provided to non-residents. Where non-resident representatives are present in New Zealand at the time of film production, the issue of whether their presence is more than a "minor presence" is a question of fact and degree of the particular circumstances of each situation.

The GST treatment of video and film services provided under contract to non residents for consumption outside of New Zealand is different in nature to contracts with non residents to provide services for consumption in New Zealand by a third party. Accordingly, the GST consequences will depend on the nature of the supply provided, including the terms of the contract, and whether consumption occurs in New Zealand.

"We're advising all businesses registered on the payments basis, or the hybrid basis, of accounting for GST to compile a list of debtors and creditors as at 30 September," he said. "This information will be required to complete the GST rate change adjustment sheet." The rate change adjustment recognises that businesses will have invoices that were issued pre-1 October with 12.5% included for which payment will be made or received after 1 October when the new 15% GST rate will apply. "A large number of businesses will make the rate change adjustment in their GST returns for the period ended 30 September which are due to be filed by 28 October" Mr Owen said. "However a number of businesses will not be required to make the adjustment until they file GST returns due at a later date". Those businesses should compile the list of debtors and creditors now so that the information is available when the return is due to be filed." "It will make it much easier if you need to make the GST rate change adjustment in GST returns due in November and subsequent months." "Businesses who have their GST returns filed by an accountant or a tax adviser should contact them as soon as possible to help speed up the process of filing GST returns over the transition period".

If the time of supply is on 30th September or earlier, the 12.5% GST rate will apply, if the time of supply is on 1 October or later, the new 15% GST rate will apply. How do I determine which GST rate to use, 12.5% or 15% over the transition period? The correct rate of GST to be used will depend on the time of supply. If the time of supply is on 30th September or earlier, the 12.5% GST rate will apply, if the time of supply is on 1 October or later, the new 15% GST rate will apply. General rule The general time of supply rule is found in s.9(1) of the GST Act. In general the 'time of supply' for goods and services, will be the earlier of the time of a payment, or the date an invoice is issued. This means if you issue an invoice on or before 30th September, or a payment is received on or before 30th September, the GST rate applying will be 12.5%. Note however that the payment must be in respect of "that supply" for the payment to constitute a time of supply for the supply of any goods and services. This means that you cannot prepay for goods and services you intend to acquire at some future time and hope that because payment has been made that the old GST rate will apply. If the invoice is dated on or after 1 October and a payment in respect of the supply is not made until 1 October or later then the GST rate will be 15%. This will be the case even if the invoice is for goods or services provided before 1 October. Some businesses invoice monthly in arrears for the services they provide. If the invoice is dated on or after 1 October GST must be applied at the 15% rate to the entire invoice, even though the services were received by the customer before 1 October. One issue that has been raised with the GST Advisory panel is the actual date invoices are prepared \[issued\]. In many cases the invoice for goods and services supplied in one month are not actually prepared until early in the following month. In the past this has not created any problems as people are in effect advancing, in some cases, the date the GST is payable. A problem will occur however in respect of supplies actually made in September but billed in October even if the invoice is dated September. Technically the new GST rate, 15%, should be applied to those invoices. The Government addressed this issue and made a legislative change that enables people to prepare the invoices for September supplies in the first 11 days of October, provided the invoice is dated on or before 30 September and is issued consistently with the registered person’s practice of issuing invoices for such supplies, and payment for the supply is due no later than 60 days from the invoice date. Continuous supplies The general time of supply rule as set out above in section 9(1) however is modified by the provisions in section (9)(3) of the GST Act. In this case where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire, or where services are supplied under any agreement which provides for periodic payments, they shall be deemed to be successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement, and each of the successive supplies shall be deemed to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier. How do I determine which GST rate to use, 12.5% or 15% over the transition period? HomeUpdatesFAQPanel How do I determine which GST rate to use, 12.5% or 15% over the transition period? | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/how-do-i-determine-which-gst-rate-use-125-or-15-over-transition-period\[24/10/2013 10:42:20\] It is important to note that the issue of an invoice does not trigger the time of supply for agreements to hire, or for services provided over a period of time with periodic payments. The rule in s.(9)(3)(a) as set out above varies from the general time of supply rule by providing that where services are successively supplied, then each such successive supply shall be deemed to take place when any payment becomes due or is received, which ever is the earlier. This recognises that where services are supplied over time, and are paid by way of instalments, it is more appropriate to recognise the time of supply for GST purposes as the earlier of the date when each payment is either due, it is paid. This can raise problems. Take a telecommunications company for example. In most cases these companies will bill for calls made, (a service provided by the company), and a line rental fee, (a charge for a successive supply of access to the company's telephone lines). In this example there are s.9(1) supplies, the toll calls, where the time of supply is effectively the date of the invoice for those tolls. There is also, however, a section 9(3)(a) supply, that is the agreement to access the company's lines, for which a monthly rental is charged in advance by the telecommunications company. The time of supply for this is, effectively, the date the rental charge is due for payment. Needless to say the two "times of supply" on the one account will not always be the same. To address this problem many companies in this type of situation have taken a pragmatic approach, and treated the date of the issue of the invoice as the time of supply, even though this may have advanced the date of payment of the GST in respect of the S.(9((3) supplies. This is fine until there is a GST rate change. Take a September 2010 telephone account; the toll calls were made last month (August). The time of supply is the date of the invoice, say 30th September, GST is payable at the rate of 12.5%, the line charge however is due and payable next month (October) so the GST rate here is at 15%. This is just too hard. As a consequence the Government has agreed to a modification of the law for the GST transition. Suppliers, who arguably may be subject to section 9(3) on at least some of their supplies, have been allowed the option referred to earlier as treating the supply as being made on the date of the invoice provided they meet the requirements of that option. Example Jims Hire Service agrees to hire a truck to Highway Deliveries. The lease is for four months from 1 September 2010, to 30 December 2010. If the transaction is invoiced prior to 1 October 2010, (say 1st September) and is payable, in full, on or before a date 60 days after the invoice date, (the 30th of October) the GST will be at 12.5%, If the agreement provides that payments will be made on the first day of each month in advance, that is 1st September, 1st October, 1st November, and 1st December, the GST on the first payment 1st September 2010 would be at 12.5% and the following months would be at 15%, unless, Highway Deliveries actually paid the following months instalments prior to 1 October 2010. The successive supply rule covers for example everything from the hire of a truck to an insurance premium. In broad terms the time of supply is the earlier of the time at which each successive payment falls due or is paid. In some cases such as a contract of insurance for a twelve month period, the premiums may be paid annually, three monthly, or monthly. A strict application of the provisions in section (9)(3)(a) would mean that the Insurance company would be required to increase the rate of GST in respect of all instalments due and paid after 1 October 2010. This clearly would have had significant compliance costs for both the insurance company and the customer often when only small amounts of extra GST is payable. To address this issue the GST Advisory Panel suggested that the Government make a legislative change to avoid this situation. The change provides:- A grand-parenting option for s 9(3)(s) successive supply contracts in place before 1 October 2010 where the consideration for a supply is set or reviewed with a maximum period of 396 days, under which GST would be payable at 12.5% for the remaining part of the contract provided: All remaining GST for the period is accounted for by the supplier in the return period that includes 30 September 2010; How do I determine which GST rate to use, 12.5% or 15% over the transition period? | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/how-do-i-determine-which-gst-rate-use-125-or-15-over-transition-period\[24/10/2013 10:42:20\] GST-registered customers can only claim back GST at 12.5% and are notified of this by their insurer within 30 days of the GST rate change. This measure will remove the substantial compliance costs for most health and general insurance providers of having to adjust the GST by amounts that are exceeded by the cost of contacting the customer to change the amount of the payment. It would also ensure that customers who paid on an instalment basis were not disadvantaged by having taken up this option rather than the option of paying annually in one lump sum. It should be noted however that the insurance customer is only allowed to claim back the GST at the 12.5% rate. There are further time of supply rules regarding successive supplies in S.9(3)(aa). Where goods are supplied progressively or periodically pursuant to any agreement and the agreement provides for the consideration for that supply to be paid in instalments or periodically in relation to the periodic or progressive supply of those goods, those goods shall be deemed to be successively supplied, and each such successive supply shall be deemed to take place whenever any payment in respect of any supply becomes due, is received, or any invoice relating only to that payment is issued, whichever is the earlier. Where goods and services are supplied directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or an engineering work, and are supplied pursuant to any agreement which provides for the consideration for that supply to become due and payable in instalments or periodically in relation to the progressive nature of that construction, manufacture, or extension, those goods and services shall be deemed to be successively supplied, and each such successive supply shall be deemed to take place whenever any payment in respect of any supply becomes due, is received, or any invoice relating only to that payment is issued, whichever is the earlier.

The recommendations follow substantial consultation with us by many businesses up and down the country who highlighted the substantial compliance costs in some cases of making systems and other changes where contracts involving periodic supplies span the 1 October date, gaps between today’s business practices and legislation that is now more than 20 years old and other issues of simple inconsistency or unfairness. The detail of the measures released today should give businesses a reasonable level of comfort that the worst of the concerns submitted to the Panel will be addressed. I would strongly urge the government to ensure that the legislation is enacted as speedily as possible before the 1 October date. Draft legislation is now available for consultation with Inland Revenue officials up until 16 August and can be obtained by calling the Minister of Revenue’s office on (04) 817 9728 or Inland Revenue on (04) 890 6386. The consultation process has highlighted the need for an overhaul of the GST time of supply rules to bring them into line with business practicalities.

The Government has also released a draft of the legislative amendments for public comment (available on request from Inland Revenue (04 890 6386) and the Minister of Revenue’s office (04 817 9728). Feedback on that draft is sought by 16 August 2010. This paper provides background and further explanation on the changes. Annual contracts involving successive supplies Many contracts, particularly in the general and health insurance area, are for a period of one year or are at least reviewed annually. In some cases the customer pays the premium in one payment while in other cases the premiums are paid progressively, say by monthly instalment. Most of these arrangements will straddle the GST rate change date of 1 October 2010 so that, in the absence of legislative change, some instalments will be at the new GST rate and some at the old. Businesses may be able to seek additional payment from customers to cover the additional GST, but in many cases the compliance cost to them of doing so is excessive relative to the amounts of GST involved. For example, there will be individual cases when the additional costs of collecting the additional GST exceed the additional GST because the contract has very little time to run. The proposed amendment would allow insurers and others the option of applying the 12.5% rate for the rest of the insured period up to the next annual review date (or less if the contract is for a lesser period) provided certain criteria are satisfied. The key criteria are that all the remaining GST is accounted for in the return period ending before 1 October 2010 and GST- registered recipients only claim back GST at the 12.5% rate. This would be achieved by treating the remaining supplies to have been made on 30 September 2010. In the event that an insurance policy or other contract subject to the transitional rule is cancelled and, therefore the supply is not fully provided, businesses would need to issue credit notes to adjust for the change in consideration and the GST incorrectly paid. A business would elect this option by making a tax return on this basis. Example A policy for car insurance covers the period 28 April 2010 to 27 April 2011 and the customer chooses to pay by monthly instalments. The insurer normally pays GST when instalments are due or received but elects to apply the transitional rule and returns the remaining GST at 12.5% in its September GST return. Subrogation payments A subrogation payment is the recovery income received by an insurer for the damages caused by a third party to their insured party. The GST Act deems the time of supply to be the day on which the insurer receives the payment. This means subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 will be subject to the new 15% GST rate, even when the underlying claim to which the payment relates was at 12.5%. The proposed change would allow the rate of GST to remain at 12.5% for subrogation payments received on or after 1 October 2010 provided the underlying claims are agreed and settled before 1 October 2010. Further proposed changes to the GST Act 1985 to help businesses transition to the new GST rate HomeUpdatesFAQPanel Further proposed changes to the GST Act 1985 to help businesses transition to the new GST rate | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/further-proposed-changes-gst-act-1985-help-businesses-transition-new-gst-rate\[24/10/2013 10:42:26\] Finance leases In agreements to hire that are finance leases, GST is applied to the supply of the good in question (a motor vehicle, for example) but not to the finance component of the transaction as financial services are GST-exempt. In finance leases the interest and principal components are calculated actuarially but to ease compliance GST payments are able to be based on a straight-line approach over the term of the lease. This means that more GST is payable on the earlier lease payments than is actually required. A square-up adjustment is normally only done when the lease terminates, to reflect any difference between the actual and expected residual value of the leased asset. With a rate change occurring during the contract term, the new rate would apply to the remaining payments under the finance lease contract. The subsequent reconciliation that would have to be undertaken on these existing contracts becomes complex and substantial systems changes would be required to accommodate it. Most contracts are with GST-registered businesses who would be able to claim back the GST anyway. The proposed change would allow finance leases entered into before 1 October 2010 for a maximum term of five years to continue to be able to be accounted for at the 12.5% rate, provided GST-registered lessees were advised by the lessors to deduct input tax at the 12.5% rate on payments made after 1 October 2010. This solution would be elective, at the option of the supplier. Aligning legislation and practice There are several instances where further legislative flexibility is needed so that GST practices adopted through systems or other commercial imperatives are not unduly affected by the rate increase. The issuing of tax invoices for pre-October supplies The first issue relates to goods or services that are supplied on or before 30 September 2010 but for which the invoice is not issued until early October even though dated before 1 October 2010. Under the GST Act, it is the date when the invoice is issued that is relevant for determining the time of the supply, so these invoices could technically be considered subject to the higher rate even though the goods or services are provided, and the invoice dated, when the rate was 12.5%. Accordingly, for the GST rate transition, the proposal is that suppliers may treat tax invoices issued on or before 11 October 2010 for goods or services provided on or before 30 September 2010 as having been issued on the date of the invoice. This is provided that the invoice is dated on or before 30 September and payment is due no later than 60 days from the invoice date. A cut-off date of 11 October has been chosen to provide two weekends to send out invoices in relation to September supplies. Option of general time of supply or successive supplies rule The second instance arises because some suppliers of what are arguably successive supplies (for example, utilities and phone line rentals) account for GST on the basis of when the invoice is issued rather than when payment is due or received. Technically, the GST rate on a successive supply should be determined by when the payment is due or received rather than when the invoice is issued. Under normal circumstances this makes no difference but with a rate change some suppliers are uncertain about whether a September invoice, for example, would need to be charged at 12.5% or at 15% as this could be dependent on whether the customer paid or was required to pay before 1 October. To address this, it is proposed that for successive supplies, suppliers have the choice of using either the invoice or the “payment due or received” rule provided, as with the previous issue, that the goods or services are provided before 1 October 2010, the invoice for the supply is dated on or before 30 September 2010, the invoice is issued by 11 October 2010 and payment is due not later than 60 days from the invoice date. Replacement invoices The third issue concerns the use of replacement tax invoices. Legally, a supplier cannot issue two tax invoices for the same supply and should be instead issuing credit or debit notes when, for example, goods are returned or additional GST is due as a result of the GST rate increase. Although longer-term this issue needs to be considered in a wider review, in the interim the proposal is that for the GST rate transition period: • As an alternative to issuing a debit note, replacement tax invoices could be issued to replace pre-1 October 2010 invoices Further proposed changes to the GST Act 1985 to help businesses transition to the new GST rate | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/further-proposed-changes-gst-act-1985-help-businesses-transition-new-gst-rate\[24/10/2013 10:42:26\] for supplies that are being provided successively, to cover the amended GST payable on the remaining services provided from 1 October. • Since in some cases a replacement invoice would alter the time of supply and hence the applicable GST rate, there would be an option of allowing the issue of a new invoice at the previous GST rate of 12.5% if it relates to revising an invoice issued before 1 October 2010, as an alternative to issuing a credit note. Layby sales For GST purposes, a layby sale is only recognised as taking place when the goods are delivered, which is normally after the last instalment payment. Goods uplifted after 30 September will, therefore, attract the new 15% GST rate. Although paying all of the lay-by instalments and collecting the layby item before 1 October would preserve the old 12.5% GST rate, this will not always be possible because of the costs involved or the goods simply not being able to be delivered before that date. An amendment is proposed for layby sales contracts that span the GST rate change date and for which a binding contract was in place before Budget night (20 May 2010). The proposal would allow suppliers to elect to apply the old 12.5% GST rate to the extent that any payments in relation to the transaction were received before 1 October 2010. Under this option, the supplier would be required to return these payments in their September 2010 GST return as there would be a deemed supply to the extent of these payments. This would be in effect an apportionment rule, with payments made from 1 October 2010 being at 15%. Private Training Establishments Private Training Establishments (PTEs) are registered with the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and are required to use a trust arrangement when students pay their course fees in full. This is to help protect students from the risk that their intended course provider does not deliver the course. As the courses are delivered, the trustee progressively pays out the funds to the PTE. In the absence of any law change, any payments released by the trust to the PTE after 1 October 2010 would be accounted for at the new 15% rate even when students have paid the full course fees before 1 October 2010. This is because the services are considered to be supplied when the payments are released to the relevant PTEs. It would be impractical for the PTEs to seek additional payments from the students. Accordingly, it is proposed to allow registered private training establishments the option of making an up-front adjustment in their 30 September GST returns that would give them a credit to cover the additional GST that would be payable when course fees held in trust as at 30 September 2010 were subsequently released to them. This would apply irrespective of whether the PTE returned GST on an invoice, hybrid or payments basis. The credit would be based on the amount held in trust for the PTE as at 30 September 2010. Application date These changes would apply from Royal assent.

The Panel was set up to help businesses and the Government implement the GST rate increase to 15% announced in Budget 2010. The website dealt with your queries and comments as you prepared to move to the new rate. The Panel considered your submissions and acted as a conduit between businesses and the Government. It monitored how businesses dealt with the changes so that the Government was aware of particular issues you may have faced in recording and charging GST at the new rate. The Panel also advised the Government on any more general concerns for particular industries, activities or types of transactions related to the GST rate increase. The Government was keen to ensure that any changes were implemented as smoothly as possible.

The general time of supply rule applies for most transactions when there is a rate change. The general rule is that a supply is considered to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or the time any payment is received by the supplier. To determine which period to account for the GST depends on what accounting basis a person or business uses, for example: Persons/businesses on an invoice basis claim GST when they receive an invoice and account for GST when they issue an invoice or receive any payment in respect of that supply, whichever comes first. Persons/businesses on a payments basis account for GST or claim GST on any payments received or made during a taxable period. Persons/businesses on a hybrid basis account for GST on supplies they make using the invoice basis and claim GST on supplies they have received, using the payments basis. Although the general time of supply rule applies for the majority of transactions, the GST Act provides special time of supply rules for some specific transactions. These are listed in the table below.

The first three instalments have been paid to the building company so that there is the last instalment (of $28,000) to be paid at completion on or about 25 October 2010, plus the retentions (of $5000) in January 2011. Will the total cost of $220,000 be increased because of the GST rate increase? The new GST rate of 15 percent will apply to the October 2010 instalment and the retentions. The building company is entitled to increase the price only in relation to the instalments (and retentions) that are payable after 1 October 2010. If the building company increases the price, the new payments would be: Last instalment28,622.22 Retention5,111.11 This is likely to still be the case even where the building contract may have been for a "fixed price". Generally, section 78(2) of the GST Act allows suppliers to increase their prices to take account of an increase in the rate of GST - unless the contract expressly provides that such an increase cannot happen. Stamps, Tokens, or Vouchers.The usual time of supply rule means that a supplier should treat stamps, tokens or vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer purchases them, not when the vouchers are redeemed. Example: Peter buys a $50 voucher from Musikco in Wellington on 15 September and gives this as a gift to Jonathan in Auckland. Jonathan buys CDs with the voucher at Music Time in Auckland on 1 November. The supply takes place when Peter buys the voucher and Musikco accounts for the sale at a GST Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] rate of 12.5% in the return which covers the September period. When Jonathan redeems the voucher, there is no underlying supply at this stage and the goods should be supplied free of GST (s 5(11F)). However, there are circumstances where the issuer of the voucher and the supplier of the goods or services may agree to recognise the supply on redemption of the voucher. Example: Musikco stores nationwide, which are independently owned but affiliated, agree that a supply takes place when a store reimburses another store for redeeming a voucher, rather than when the voucher is sold. In this case, Music Time in the above example would account for the sale at the GST rate of 15% in the GST return that covers the November period. Insurance claims: Claim payments received by a registered person from an Insurance Company under a contract of insurance are a taxable supply. What rate of GST is payable for claims made prior to 1 October but received after 1 October? Time of supply is the day on which the payment is received from the insurance company. GST output tax is accounted for in the period of receipt of payment. Example: Kevin, a registered person who operates a plumbing business, has tools stolen from his garage. Two months after the burglary on 15 October 2010 Kevin receives a payment from his insurance company in respect of his claim for the theft. GST is accounted for in the return which covers the October period at the new rate of 15%. Professional services: I am a solicitor who charges my clients for my legal services every two months. If I have done work for a client in September 2010 and send an invoice in October 2010, can I use the 12.5 percent GST rate? No - all invoices issued on or after 1 October 2010 are required to have the 15 percent GST rate. The solution to this is to ensure all invoices for services provided in September are issued in September. Hire Purchase AgreementsTime of supply occurs at the time the agreement is entered into. All hire purchase sales should be included in the taxable period covering the date the hire purchase agreement is entered into, regardless of the accounting basis is used. Example: Walter Wall sells a carpet on hire purchase to Homer Ohner on 7 June. The cash price is $550, which includes GST. The agreement is for 36 monthly payments of $23, totalling $828. Walter accounts for the sale on the cash price of the goods of $550 in the GST period covering 7 June. Homer also claims GST input tax credits for his purchase on the cash price of the goods ($550) in the period covering 7 June. The difference of $278 is the finance charge, which is an exempt supply. Registered person on a payments basis: I am a registered person and use the payments basis of accounting for GST. I understand that I have to pay GST at 15% on any payments I receive on or after 1 October 2010 and that I will also claim an input tax adjustment of 15% on any payments I make after that date. I also understand an adjustment is required to ensure supplies charged at the old rates are accounted for at those rates. Would you please explain the adjustments I will need to make on 30 September 2010. The adjustment will mean that all income received after 1 October will be accounted for at the new rate even though you may have charged for that work at the old (12.5%) rate. However, you will also be allowed an input tax deduction based on the new rate, even though you may have only been charged 12.5% GST. You will need to calculate the transitional adjustment on a special GST transitional adjustment form, which Inland Revenue will provide you. The calculation requires you to calculate the value of your debtors and creditors on 30 September 2010. You then deduct the value of your debtors from your creditors and divide the difference by 51.75 (which is the difference between the old and new rates of GST). If your debtors exceed your creditors, a GST credit will arise that can be used to offset GST payable. When your creditors exceed your debtors, GST is payable and is included in your GST return for the period covering 30 September 2010. Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] The calculation means that you will not have to continue to account for the income for work you have charged or expenses you have incurred at the old rate after 1 October 2010 when the new GST rate applies. NOTE: if you are using the hybrid method of accounting for GST you will need to check the definition of "qualifying supplies". Second hand goods: I am a registered person and use the invoice basis of accounting for GST. I purchased land for $350,000 from a person who is not registered on 15 September and I still owe $150,000 as at 30 September 2010. How do I claim the second-hand goods input tax deduction? You will need to make a similar adjustment to that set out above. You will make an adjustment on the unpaid portion (i.e. $150,000 / 51.75 = $2,898.55). This figure goes in the GST return for the period ended 30 September 2010. When you pay the $150,000 you will be able to claim an input tax deduction of 3/23rds of the amount paid. Goods supplied under an agreement to hire that provides for periodic payment Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Persons on the invoice basis account for the supply in full in the period in which the earlier of these events occurs. Payments basis customers account for tax at the rate applying when payment is received or made. Example: Anna hired a piece of machinery from Mark on 1 June for six months. Mark advises that they will require monthly payments due on 1stth of each month. GST of 12.5% will apply to payments made in July, August and September. GST of 15% will apply on payments due on 1 October and 1 November. If Anna decides to pay the monthly payments that would be due in October and November early - before 30 September, then GST of 12.5% will apply to those early payments. Mark will need to include those early payments in the GST return covering the period in which the early payment was made by Anna. Local Authority Rates: Super City issue rates notices to their ratepayers in July each year. The rates notice gives ratepayers the option of making a payment for the full amount of the rates on the first instalment date - 20th October, or ratepayers can choose to make payment in four instalments for each quarter ending September 2010 (due 20th October), December 2010 (due 20th January), March 2011 (due 20th April) and June 2011 (due 20th July). The instalment notices for the quarter ended 30 September 2010 are issued on 24th September. Payment will be due 20th October 2010. Super City has asked whether the GST on that instalment should include GST at 12.5%, or 15%. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: the date of an instalment notice is issued; or the due date for payment, or the date when payment is received. As the instalment notice is issued before 1 October 2010, the GST will be at 12.5%. The instalment notices issued for the ensuing quarters will include GST at 15%. However, those residents who choose to pay the full amount of their rates in the first quarter (i.e. they do not choose the instalment option) will pay GST at 12.5%. Periodic supplies: On 1 July 2010 Matt signs an agreement to lease a car park from Parking Co. The agreement requires Matt to pay a fee of $120 each month (inclusive of GST), payable on 20th of each month. A tax invoice was provided to Matt at the time he signed the agreement. The tax invoice requires Matt to pay a fee of $120 per Each monthly payment is a separate supply. The time of supply is the time each payment becomes due or is received, which ever is the earlier. Here, that would be the 20th of each month. The GST Act also allows a supplier to increase their price to provide for the increase in the rate of GST. In Matt’s case Parking Co may increase the monthly payments to $122.66 to reflect the increase in the GST rate. Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] month (inclusive of GST), payable on the 20th of each month. Similar outcomes would apply to commercial leases and other similar commercial arrangements. For example, a monthly fee for the use of an electronic database, or a gym membership. A plumber has asked what rate of GST should be charged on invoices issued prior to 1 October 2010, but for which payment will not be received until after 1 October. All invoices issued prior to 1 October 2010 should have GST included at 12.5% - even if you do not expect to be paid until after that date. If you account for GST using the payments basis you will need to have record of outstanding debtors and creditors as at 30 September 2010. You will make an adjustment so that you will not have to keep a track of income and expenses at different rates of GST. After 1 October you will pay GST at 15% for all payments received, and will also be able to claim GST at 15% on expenses paid after that date. Information about how to make the necessary adjustment will be sent to you by Inland Revenue prior to 1 October. The plumber also asked what rate of GST should be shown on work which was quoted using 12.5% GST, but will not be completed and charged until after 1 October. Section 78(2) of the GST Act states that contracts or agreements entered into prior to a change in the rate of GST may be altered to take account of the rate change, unless the contract expressly provides that this provision is not to apply. This will mean that, unless the contract or agreement provides otherwise, even though a job may have been quoted at 12.5% GST, any work invoiced after the date of the rate change can be charged at the new GST rate. A retailer has asked what rate of GST should be used on a credit note issued for goods that had been purchased before 30 September 2010, but returned after 1 October 2010. The initial supply would have been made using a GST rate of 12.5%. Therefore, the credit note should use that same rate, or the customer will be refunded for more than they had paid for the goods. Normally a credit note would be included in Box 11 of the GST return. However, as the amount of GST is not the \[new\] standard rate, the GST portion only of the credit note should be included as an adjustment to input tax and included with the adjustments at box 13. Example: A fashion store sells a dress for $270 on 29 September. The sale is included in the return for the period ended 30 September. On 3 October the dress is returned and a credit is issued. As the credit note will be made using the old rate of GST (12.5%), the GST portion of the credit note (1/9th of $270 = $30) is included in Box 13 of the store’s GST return for the next GST period. A hotel is providing facilities for a large conference to be held on November 2010. They will be invoicing their client in July, even though the conference will be in November, and have asked what rate of GST should apply. Even though the invoice relates to a service that will be provided after 1 October 2010, the time of supply rule will be triggered at the time the invoice is issued (or any payment is received by the hotel). In this case, because the invoice will be issued before 30 September, the GST rate the hotel should include will be 12.5%. The hotel will include the supply in their GST return covering July 2010. New tax fraction: What is the new tax fraction and how will it be calculated? The new tax fraction (the tax rate divided by the sum of 100 plus the tax rate) will be 3/23. This fraction can be applied to the price of goods or services to see how much GST is included in the price. For example, if the cost of a fridge is $2,000 inclusive of GST, the GST included in the price will be $260.87. ($2,000 x 3) divided by 23 This will mean that 3/23 of all supplies made at the new rate will represent GST payable to the Inland Revenue, and 3/23rds of all supplies received by a registered person will represent GST that can be claimed back by the supplier. Payments basis and hybrid basis taxpayers The GST Act will require everyone on the payments or hybrid basis of Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] accounting for GST to pay 3/23rds of all payments received in respect of taxable supplies after 30th September to the Inland Revenue Department as GST. Conversely they will be able to claim back 3/23rds of all payments made for taxable supplies after 30th September as input tax. In some cases those supplies will have been made and invoiced before 30th September so will include GST at 12.5%. The will mean that in those cases more GST will be paid after 30th September than was invoiced, and more GST will be claimed back after 30th September than was charged. This is compensated by a special adjustment required in the GST return which includes the 30th of September. Example Home town Plumbers Ltd have $13,500 owing to them on 30 September 2010. This was made up of sales $12,000 plus GST of $1,500. They also owe $9,000 on the same date. This was made up of purchases $8,000 plus GST of $1,000. When the company collects the $13,500 on say 15th October thy will account for GST at the new tax fraction of 3/23rds, or $1,760.87. They will pay $260.87 more GST than the company has collected. When the company pays its creditors the $9,000, in say October, they will claim GST at the new tax fraction rate, 3/23rds, and will claim back $1,173.91. This is $173.91 more than the company paid. The purpose of the special adjustment form is to compensate for this difference. In Hometown Plumbers Ltd case thy will be in the following position: More GST paid than charged$260.87 Less more GST claimed than paid$173.91 Net GST overpaid$86.96 This amount is claimed back as an adjustment in the return submitted on 30th September 2010. Adjustment in the GST return which includes the 30th of September. There will be a special adjustment form \[GST 105\] provided by the Inland Revenue Department to make the adjustment described above. The form will require persons registered on the payments basis to provide the following information Creditors at 30 September$ BOX A Debtors at 30 September$ BOX B Subtract BOX B from BOX A$ BOX C Divide BOX C by 51.75$ BOX D If the amount in BOX A is larger than in BOX B the amount in BOX D represents GST payable in the return form for the period which includes 30th September.

It will reduce the GST otherwise payable in that quarter by the amount of the adjustment. What do I do if I am on the payments basis of accounting for GST but have not managed to get details of all my creditors owing on 30the September before I am due to file my GST return on 28th October 2010. Where possible you should make every effort to obtain details. Where you are not able to do this, you can take advantage of a provision in the GST Act which allows you to make an adjustment in a subsequent return where the amount of GST involved is less than $500. This means that if the creditors you are unable to get details of by 28th October do not exceed $25,875 you can make the adjustment, $500, in the next GST return. This would be preferable to filing a late return due to the creditors not being available. Issues where GST returns straddle the GST rate change date The GST is payable with a return furnished monthly, two monthly, or six monthly. The design of the GST Return Form is based on taking the tax fraction of goods and services received or provided and hence arriving at the net GST payable or receivable. Where a taxpayer is accounting for GST on the invoice basis, and has a GST return period ending on 30th September 2010, there will be no problems. The returns will be based on the dates of the invoices received or issued. Where the return straddles 1 October it will not be possible to do a "conventional GST return" using two rates. Therefore a special return will be required on 30th September 2010. Copies of the special return form will automatically be sent to affected taxpayers Trading over midnight on 30 September: My business will be operating on midnight of 30 September, when the new rate takes effect and I will be making supplies both immediately before and immediately after midnight. How do I account for the new rate? It is accepted that in practice it will be difficult to identify the precise point when sales should be returned at the new GST rate in the above circumstances. However, similar issues will arise for this group of taxpayers at the end of each GST reporting period, as businesses who trade on a 24/7 basis, or who make supplies at midnight on the last day of any GST reporting period need to have a notional cut-off time. The cut-off time delineates when sales for one period cease and sales begin to be made for the next period. Inland Revenue have advised that businesses should follow the same process they normally use to determine which GST return a sale around the end of one GST period is made in. For example, Jim is registered for GST on the payments' basis. He operates a bar that trades past midnight every night. It would be assumed that when Jim does his banking on Friday 1 October, the amount that he banks would relate to the sales that his bar made before 1 October. Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] Private Training Establishments (PTE): As a registered PTE, my students' course fees are required to be paid into a trust. As the course progresses, the trust progressively releases these course fees to my PTE. Does the 15 percent GST rate apply to the amounts that are released by the trust to my PTE after 1 October 2010? Yes, the 15% GST rate applies to these amounts. However, the transitional provisions give registered PTEs the option of making an up-front adjustment in their 30 September GST returns, based on the amount held in trust for the PTE as at 30 September 2010. This would apply irrespective of whether the PTE returned GST on an invoice, hybrid or payments basis. The adjustment would give them a credit to cover the additional GST that would be payable when course fees held in trust as at 30 September 2010 are subsequently released to them. To establish the amount of the adjustment the fees held in trust on 30th September should be divided by 51.75. The resulting figure should be entered on the GST Return, which includes the 30th of September, as a credit in box 13 or 13A of the GST return. Laybys: If I put an item on layby, what is the amount of GST I have to pay on the purchase? Generally speaking for laybys, the amount of GST you pay on the purchase depends on when you and take ownership of the item regardless of when the final payment is made. . For example, if you make your final payment and pick up the goods, at a later date, the GST rate applicable is normally the rate applying on the date the goods are uplifted. Therefore if the goods are collected;- on or before 30 September 2010 you'll be charged GST at 12.5%. on or after 1 October 2010 you'll be charged GST at 15%. There are, however, transitional rules for layby sales arrangements made before Budget day (20th May 2010). Layby sales - transitional rule: How do the new lay-by sales transitional provisions apply? Example: A customer enters into an agreement to lay-by a TV for Christmas 2010 on 10 April 2010 with TVco (supplier). The customer pays TVco an amount every fortnight until he picks up the TV on 15 December. As a supplier, TVco can elect to pay for all payments they have received from the customer up to and including 30 September to be at the 12.5% GST rate and include this total figure in their sales for the return period covering September. TVco will need to issue an invoice for the total of these payments. The rest of the payments received after 1 October will be subject to GST at 15%, when the goods are delivered. TVco would include the total of the rest of the payments in the return covering December 2010 at 15%. The supplier will need to issue an invoice for the total of these payments. What is the new composite rate for rest homes and private hospitals?: In 1986 Inland Revenue reached agreement with bodies that represent rest homes and private hospitals on a standard apportionment rate of domestic and non-domestic goods and services for rest homes and for private hospitals. Those rates were: For rest homes - 45% domestic / 55% non-domestic; and For private hospitals 35% domestic / 65% non-domestic. Based on these agreements and a GST rate of 15% for non-domestic goods and services and a 9% rate for domestic goods and services: The new composite rate for rest homes is 12.3% (previously 10.25%); and The new composite rate for private hospitals is 12.9% (previously 10.75%). Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] Bookings made before 1 October 2010: What is the rate of GST for a family holiday in November 2010, which I booked for in 20 August 2010? If you booked and paid for the holiday in full before 1 October, GST at 12.5% would apply. That is, you would pay 12.5% GST on the purchase of trip, and the supplier would account for GST at the corresponding 12.5% rate. If a booking is made, and a deposit has been paid, on a quoted price of 12.5% GST before 1 October 2010, GST would be payable at 12.5% if the supplier actually receives the deposit before 1 October 2010. If there was only a booking made before 1 October, the issuing of an invoice may trigger the time of supply, and GST at 12.5%. In any case, the nature of each individual agreement is important and each agreement will need to be closely examined in light of its own contractual terms. Reissuing of tax invoices after 1 October: I issue a tax invoice on 25 September 2010 with an incorrect name on it. This error is discovered on 13 October. If I reissue a replacement invoice after 1 October, will I have to charge GST at 15% on that supply? The legislation that has been enacted to provide certainty on various transitional issues applies in these circumstances (see new section 78AA(13) of the GST Act). Provided the original incorrect invoice is cancelled by issuing a credit note that complies with the requirements of section 25 of the GST Act and a replacement invoice is issued to the correct recipient, the replacement invoice can account for GST at the 12.5% rate. Insurance receipts: What happens if my insurance company makes a payment to me that I do not receive until after 1 October? When a GST registered party receives an insurance payout from their insurer in relation to a loss incurred in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity, they are required to pay GST on that payment. A deemed supply arises on the day the registered person receives the payment. (section 5(13)) A payment may be made by the insurer in late September 2010 but not received by the insured party until October 2010. This would mean that the recipient has to pay GST at the rate of 15% on the payment, but because the payment by the insurer may only factor in GST at the old rate of 12.5% 1, the overall payment may not fully cover the loss. An amendment provides some leeway for payments in the pipeline (see section 78AA(14)). A payment under a contract of insurance received on or after 1 October 2010 is treated as being received on 30 September 2010 if: the payment is made before 1 October 2010; and the registered person receives the payment on or before 11 October 2010. The old 12.5% rate of GST therefore applies to the payment in these circumstances. A simple way for people on the payments basis or the hybrids basis to deal with this situation is to treat the payment paid in September but received in October, as a debtor as part of the adjustment required in the GST return which includes the 30th of September. Finance leases: What finance leases are covered by the transitional arrangements? In agreements to hire that are finance leases, GST is applied to the supply of the good in question (a motor vehicle, for example) but not to the finance component of the transaction as financial services are GST-exempt. In such leases the interest and principal components may be in effect calculated actuarially but, to ease compliance, GST payments are able to be based on a straight-line approach over the term of the lease. This means that more GST is payable on the earlier lease payments than is actually required. A square-up adjustment is normally only done when the lease terminates, to reflect any difference between the actual and expected residual value of the leased asset. With a rate change occurring during the contract term, and in the absence of the Frequently Asked Questions | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/faq\[24/10/2013 10:42:36\] transitional provision, the new rate would apply to the remaining (monthly) payments under the contract. The transitional provision allows certain finance leases entered into before 1 October 2010 for a maximum term of five years to continue to be able to be accounted for at the 12.5% rate, if the lessor so elects. The lessor electing this option, is required to advise GST-registered lessees to deduct input tax at the 12.5% rate on payments made after 1 October 2010. Only leases where under the agreement part of the (monthly) payment is consideration for a supply that is the provision of credit under a credit contract, and that amount decreases for each successive payment, qualify for the option. Transitional legislation: Where do I find the legislation that enacts the transitional provisions for the GST rate change? The relevant legislation was the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010, recently passed by Parliament. The legislation can be found in the: Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 (PDF, 1.86MB, 104 pages) The transitional provisions are sections 193 (which inserts a new section 78AA of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985), section 194 (which amends section 78B of the GST Act) and section 174 (which inserts a new section 183AA(4)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

All invoices issued prior to 1 October 2010 should have GST included at 12.5% - even if you do not expect to be paid until after that date. If you account for GST using the payments basis you will need to have record of outstanding debtors and creditors as at 30 September 2010. You will make an adjustment so that you will not have to keep a track of income and expenses at different rates of GST. After 1 October you will pay GST at 15% for all payments received, and will also be able to claim GST at 15% on expenses paid after that date. Information about how to make the necessary adjustment will be sent to you by Inland Revenue prior to 1 October. The Plumber also asked what rate of GST should be shown on work which was quoted using 12.5% GST, but will not be completed and charged until after 1 October. Section 78(2) of the GST Act states that contracts or agreements entered into prior to a change in the rate of GST may be altered to take account of the rate change, unless the contract expressly provides that this provision is not to apply. This will mean that, unless the contract or agreement provides otherwise, even though a job may have been quoted at 12.5% GST, any work invoiced after the date of the rate change can be charged at the new GST rate. A retailer has asked what rate of GST should be used on a credit note issued for goods that had The initial supply would have been made using a GST rate of 12.5%. Therefore, the credit note should use that same rate, or the customer will be Transactions that could affect GST registered businesses | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/transactions-could-affect-gst-registered-businesses\[24/10/2013 10:42:56\] been purchased before 30 September 2010, but returned after 1 October 2010. refunded for more than they had paid for the goods. Normally a credit note would be included in Box 11 of the GST return. However, as the amount of GST is not the \[new\] standard rate, the GST portion only of the credit note should be included as an adjustment to input tax and included with the adjustments at box 13. Example: A fashion store sells a dress for $270 on 29 September. The sale is included in the return for the period ended 30 September. On 3 October the dress is returned and a credit is issued. As the credit note will be made using the old rate of GST (12.5%), the GST portion of the credit note (1/9th of $270 = $30) is included in Box 13 of the store’s GST return for the next GST period. A taxpayer who has a dairy that opens until 11:00pm asks how to account for GST on sales made on the evening of 30 September. Generally the taxpayer prepares the GST return from bank statements – accounting for output tax at the time the money is deposited into the bank account. However, trading for the period after banking on 30 September will be deposited on 1 October. The taxpayer is concerned that GST will need to paid at 15% even though it related to sales made when the GST rate was still 12.5%. It may be reasonably common practice to use bank statements to prepare GST returns and to account for cash sales using the date that the money for those sales is deposited into a bank account. However, the time of supply for those cash sales is the time the money was received - that is the time that payment was made. Taxpayers will need to take note of what deposits relate to sales made on or before 30 September and which deposits relate to sales made after that date. Cash sales made on or before 30 September will be liable to GST at the old rate of 12.5%, even if the money is not deposited until after that date. In this case the taxpayer will need to include those sales in their GST return for the period ending 30 September and will pay GST output tax at 12.5%. A hotel is providing facilities for a large conference to be held on November 2010. They will be invoicing their client in July, even though the conference will be in November, and have asked what rate of GST should apply. Even though the invoice relates to a service that will be provided after 1 October 2010, the time of supply rule will be triggered at the time the invoice is issued (or any payment is received by the hotel). In this case, because the invoice will be issued before 30 September, the GST rate the hotel should include will be 12.5%. The hotel will include the supply in their GST return covering July 2010. Payments by instalments: I have entered into a contract with a building company to build our new family home. The first three instalments have been paid to the building company so that there is the last instalment (of $28,000) to be paid at completion on or about 25 October 2010, plus the retentions (of $5000) in January 2011. Will the total cost of $220,000 be increased because of the GST rate increase? The new GST rate of 15 percent will apply to the October 2010 instalment and the retentions. The building company is entitled to increase the price only in relation to the instalments (and retentions) that are payable after 1 October 2010. If the building company increases the price, the new payments would be: Last instalment28,622.22 Retention5,111.11 This is likely to still be the case even where the building contract may have been for a "fixed price". Generally, section 78(2) of the GST Act allows suppliers to increase their prices to take account of an increase in the rate of GST - unless the contract expressly provides that such an increase cannot happen. Stamps, Tokens, or Vouchers.The usual time of supply rule means that a supplier should treat stamps, tokens or vouchers as a supply for GST purposes at the time a customer purchases them, not when the vouchers are redeemed. Example: Peter buys a $50 voucher from Musikco in Wellington on 15 September and gives this as a gift to Jonathan in Auckland. Jonathan buys CDs with the voucher at Music Time in Auckland on 1 November. The supply takes place when Peter buys the voucher and Musikco accounts for the sale at a GST rate of 12.5% in the return which covers the September period. When Transactions that could affect GST registered businesses | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/transactions-could-affect-gst-registered-businesses\[24/10/2013 10:42:56\] Jonathan redeems the voucher, there is no underlying supply at this stage and the goods should be supplied free of GST (s 5(11F)). However, there are circumstances where the issuer of the voucher and the supplier of the goods or services may agree to recognise the supply on redemption of the voucher. Example: Musikco stores nationwide, which are independently owned but affiliated, agree that a supply takes place when a store reimburses another store for redeeming a voucher, rather than when the voucher is sold. In this case, Music Time in the above example would account for the sale at the GST rate of 15% in the GST return that covers the November period. Insurance claims: Claim payments received by a registered person from an Insurance Company under a contract of insurance are a taxable supply. What rate of GST is payable for claims made prior to 1 October but received after 1 October? Time of supply is the day on which the payment is received from the insurance company. GST output tax is accounted for in the period of receipt of payment. Example: Kevin, a registered person who operates a plumbing business, has tools stolen from his garage. Two months after the burglary on 15 October 2010 Kevin receives a payment from his insurance company in respect of his claim for the theft. GST is accounted for in the return which covers the October period at the new rate of 15%. Professional services: I am a solicitor who charges my clients for my legal services every two months. If I have done work for a client in September 2010 and send an invoice in October 2010, can I use the 12.5 percent GST rate? No - all invoices issued on or after 1 October 2010 are required to have the 15 percent GST rate. The solution to this is to ensure all invoices for services provided in September are issued in September. Hire Purchase AgreementsTime of supply occurs at the time the agreement is entered into. All hire purchase sales should be included in the taxable period covering the date the hire purchase agreement is entered into, regardless of the accounting basis is used. Example: Walter Wall sells a carpet on hire purchase to Homer Ohner on 7 June. The cash price is $550, which includes GST. The agreement is for 36 monthly payments of $23, totalling $828. Walter accounts for the sale on the cash price of the goods of $550 in the GST period covering 7 June. Homer also claims GST input tax credits for his purchase on the cash price of the goods ($550) in the period covering 7 June. The difference of $278 is the finance charge, which is an exempt supply. Registered person on a payments basis: I am a registered person and use the payments basis of accounting for GST. I understand that I have to pay GST at 15% on any payments I receive on or after 1 October 2010 and that I will also claim an input tax adjustment of 15% on any payments I make after that date. I also understand an adjustment is required to ensure supplies charged at the old rates are accounted for at those rates. Would you please explain the adjustments I will need to make on 30 September 2010. The adjustment will mean that all income received after 1 October will be accounted for at the new rate even though you may have charged for that work at the old (12.5%) rate. However, you will also be allowed an input tax deduction based on the new rate, even though you may have only been charged 12.5% GST. You will need to calculate the transitional adjustment on a special GST transitional adjustment form, which Inland Revenue will provide you. The calculation requires you to calculate the value of your debtors and creditors on 30 September 2010. You then deduct the value of your debtors from your creditors and multiply the difference by 0.019324 (which is the difference between the old and new rates of GST). If your debtors exceed your creditors, a GST credit will arise that can be used to offset GST payable. When your creditors exceed your debtors, GST is payable and is included in your GST return for the period covering 30 September 2010. Transactions that could affect GST registered businesses | GST Advisory Panel http://www.gstadvisory.govt.nz/content/transactions-could-affect-gst-registered-businesses\[24/10/2013 10:42:56\] The calculation means that you will not have to continue to account for the income for work you have charged or expenses you have incurred at the old rate after 1 October 2010 when the new GST rate applies. NOTE: if you are using the hybrid method of accounting for GST you will need to check the definition of "qualifying supplies". Second hand goods: I am a registered person and use the invoice basis of accounting for GST. I purchased land for $350,000 from a person who is not registered on 15 September and I still owe $150,000 as at 30 September 2010. How do I claim the second-hand goods input tax deduction? You will need to make a similar adjustment to that set out above. You would include the nominal GST on the unpaid portion (i.e. 1/9th of $150,000 = $16,666.66 x 0.019324 = $322.06. This figure goes in the GST return for the period ended 30 September 2010. When you pay the $150,000 you will be able to claim an input tax deduction of 3/23rds of the amount paid. Goods supplied under an agreement to hire that provides for periodic payment Periodic payments and hire agreements are treated as a series of separate supplies for each period of the agreement. The time of supply is the date payment is due or received, whichever is earlier. Persons on the invoice basis account for the supply in full in the period in which the earlier of these events occurs. Payments basis customers account for tax at the rate applying when payment is received or made. Example: Anna hired a piece of machinery from Mark on 1 June for six months. Mark advises that they will require monthly payments due on 1stth of each month. GST of 12.5% will apply to payments made in July, August and September. GST of 15% will apply on payments due on 1 October and 1 November. If Anna decides to pay the monthly payments that would be due in October and November early - before 30 September, then GST of 12.5% will apply to those early payments. Mark will need to include those early payments in the GST return covering the period in which the early payment was made by Anna. Local Authority Rates: Super City issue rates notices to their ratepayers in July each year. The rates notice gives ratepayers the option of making a payment for the full amount of the rates on the first instalment date - 20th October, or ratepayers can choose to make payment in four instalments for each quarter ending September 2010 (due 20th October), December 2010 (due 20th January), March 2011 (due 20th April) and June 2011 (due 20th July). The instalment notices for the quarter ended 30 September 2010 are issued on 24th September. Payment will be due 20th October 2010. Super City has asked whether the GST on that instalment should include GST at 12.5%, or 15%. The time of supply for rates is on the earlier of: the date of an instalment notice is issued; or the due date for payment, or the date when payment is received. As the instalment notice is issued before 1 October 2010, the GST will be at 12.5%. The instalment notices issued for the ensuing quarters will include GST at 15%. However, those residents who choose to pay the full amount of their rates in the first quarter (i.e. they do not choose the instalment option) will pay GST at 12.5%. Periodic supplies: On 1 July 2010 Matt signs an agreement to lease a car park from Parking Co. The agreement requires Matt to pay a fee of $120 each month (inclusive of GST), payable on 20th of each month. A tax invoice was provided to Matt at the time he signed the agreement. The tax invoice requires Matt to pay a fee of $120 per month Each monthly payment is a separate supply. The time of supply is the time each payment becomes due or is received, which ever is the earlier. Here, that would be the 20th of each month. The GST Act also allows a supplier to increase their price to provide for the increase in the rate of GST. In Matt’s case Parking Co may increase the monthly payments to $122.66 to reflect the increase in the GST rate.

Similar outcomes would apply to commercial leases and other similar commercial arrangements. For example, a monthly fee for the use of an electronic database, or a gym membership.

The Panel is already aware of a number of questions and concerns that businesses have. Most of the issues concern the time of supply rules and the impact the increase in GST will have on various supplies that straddle 1 October 2010. Issues discussed at the meeting included: The Panel will continue to consider issues as they arise, and will provide comment on this site on a regular basis. Contracts that the span the GST introduction date of 1 October. An important issue is the “time of supply” of goods and services as the time of supply will determine if the appropriate GST rate is 12.5% or 15%. This is particularly important when goods or services are supplied during a period that includes the GST rate change date. This for example includes insurance contracts where the invoice for the insurance is issued prior to the date of the GST change, but payments are made monthly over a twelve month period. Contracts that span 1 October 2010 also include contracts for the sale and purchase of land which become unconditional prior to 1 October 2010, \[the rate change date\], but which are settled on or after 1 October. Similar issues in respect of both operating and financing leases that are entered into prior to the GST change date, but which continue after 1 October 2010, for example motor vehicle leases. Industry-specific transitional issues including tourism products. There are potential issues where tourism packages have been sold overseas prior to the GST introduction date but the tourists do not arrive in New Zealanduntil after the introduction of the 15% rate. The panel is aware of the difficulties for Local Authorities whose rates year runs from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. Issues arise in respect of the correct GST treatment when the period includes a change in the GST rate. The panel is also aware that some issues will arise for businesses in ensuring their systems are updated for the rate increase. There are also concerns being raised about the filing of GST returns where an organisation's GST return date is not on 30 September. This will involve the return for that period being partially at the old rate, and partially at the new rate. The Panel will continue to consider issues as they arise, and will provide comment on this site on a regular basis.

Guidance on a "reasonable daily travelling distance"
====================================================

2010 article provides guidance on legislation relating to work-related relocation payments, or 'reasonable daily travelling distance'.

This item provides further detail on recently enacted legislation relating to work-related relocation payments.

One of the requirements of a "work-related relocation"[\[1\]](#01)
 is that the relocation of the place where an employee lives is required because the employee's workplace is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee's residence.

"Reasonable daily travelling distance" is not defined in the legislation. A number of submissions during consultation on the development of the policy and legislation in relation to the tax treatment of relocation payments asked for guidelines from Inland Revenue on what is meant by "reasonable travelling distance".

The information provided here is a guideline only. It is ultimately up to the taxpayer to form a view on what he or she considers to be reasonable. The guideline is based on the assumed time it would take the average person to drive the distance to and from work. There may be special circumstances surrounding why an employee or employer might consider a lesser distance or time to be a reasonable cut-off, such as if the person had a physical disability that limited their scope to drive long distances. The guideline also assumes that the employee will choose the most efficient route to work. Usually this will be the shortest route, but this may not always be so; a longer route may be quicker because of lighter traffic flows. An employee might also have a range of transport options, such as travelling by car, rail, bus or ferry. The guideline should be applied using the mode of transport, or reasonable combination of modes, that is quickest and most feasible in the circumstances.

The two key practical constraints on the daily travelling distance to and from work are the actual distance itself and the time it takes to travel that distance. Traffic density at normal travel times to and from work, for example, is a factor in limiting the distance that could be reasonably travelled because it extends the time taken to travel the distance. Traffic density should, however, be less of an issue if there is an adequate public transport alternative. Employees may be prepared to commute longer distances outside of the main centres because the roads are less congested at the time they travel.

The condition of the roads may also affect the distance that can be covered in a given time. For example, in some parts of the country, roads may be more winding than in other areas.

In terms of travelling time, we note that many employees are prepared to commute for up to an hour each way between home and work.

Furthermore, an employee is likely to factor in the aggregate time and distance travelled to get to work and back again when considering whether it is reasonable. A substantially shorter time on one leg of the journey may, for example, compensate for the other leg taking a long time.

Given the range of factors involved in determining what is "a reasonable travelling distance", it is not possible to accommodate them all within a precise formula. Only a general rule of thumb can be provided. In these circumstances, a guideline incorporating the various factors would be whether, taking the two legs in combination, the employee has to, on the relevant day, travel more than two hours at the time the employee needs to travel to get from home to work and from work to home. If this were the case, the distance between home and work would not be considered a reasonable daily travelling distance. Generally this equates to between 50 kms and 80 kms for each leg of the journey or between 100 kms and 160 kms, taking both legs into account, depending on the time of day, state of the roads and the mode of transport.

**Example**

Jessica was previously employed by Fantastic Enterprises in its Papakura branch, which is a relatively short distance from where she lives near the town of Miranda. Fantastic Enterprises requires a new branch manager in Auckland Central and Jessica moves to a house in Waitakere. Fantastic Enterprises wants to pay Jessica"s relocation costs tax-free. The issue is whether Miranda was within a "reasonable daily travelling distance" of the new work premises in Auckland Central. The distance from Miranda to Auckland Central via State Highway 2 is approximately 79 kms, and the travelling time for Jessica to start at 8.30 am is 1 hour 40 minutes. At night, Jessica usually works until 7 pm and her travelling time is about 55 minutes. Jessica has heard that some of her neighbours in Miranda travel the coastal route into Auckland which takes a shorter time, but is a longer distance.

Fantastic Enterprises can pay Jessica's relocation costs tax-free because:

*   the time it would have taken to travel the distance from Miranda to Auckland and back again using State Highway 2 would have been a combined 2 hours 35 minutes
*   alternatively, if Jessica chooses the coastal route (where each leg of the journey is 90 kms but the travel time is only 65 minutes), the combination of the two legs would have also exceeded two hours
*   similarly, if Jessica had used a combination of the two routes, her combined travel distance of 169 kms would take at least two hours.

* * *

1 See section CW 17B(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section CW 17B, an amount that an employer pays to or on behalf of an employee in connection with the expenses of the employee in a work-related relocation is exempt income of the employee.

Guide for completing NOPA for GST dispute about zero-rating
===========================================================

Here are some suggested entries you might make in a Notice of proposed adjustment  (NOPA) - IR770 form for this type of dispute. These are  a guide only and if your circumstances are similar to the scenario, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your view

### Scenario

You have filed your GST return for the period ending 31/03/2022 without claiming an input tax deduction for a major asset purchase. The main reason was because you did not have a tax invoice showing that the amount included GST at the rate of 15%. The vendor considers the transaction to be a zero-rated supply of a going concern. She has issued a tax invoice at the rate of 0% on that basis.

To protect your position, you now want to issue a NOPA for that GST return to claim the input tax deduction even though the vendor has refused to issue a new tax invoice showing that GST at the rate of 15% was charged. Generally, you have 4 months to file this NOPA from the date your return is received by us.

### Suggested entries in the NOPA

#### What is the change you want?

**_For a change to an assessment_**

_Form number of the return you filed_

You’ll need to enter the form number of the return you filed. For example, GST101.

_Period the return covered:_

You’ll need to enter the period the return covered. For example, 01/02/2021 to 31/03/2022

_What is the amount of the change you want made to the assessment?_

You’ll need to enter the amount of the change you want made to the assessment. For example, if you are claiming an additional input tax deduction, you might say, 'I am proposing that I be allowed an input tax deduction of $152,500.00 for the purchase of business assets.'

#### What facts support the change you want?

Describe the facts and circumstances that support your proposed change. Include any important facts you think we may not know. Relevant facts might include:

1.  What your taxable activity involves
2.  The nature of the purchase. For example, earthmoving machinery.
3.  Explain why you do not have a GST inclusive tax invoice for the input tax deduction. For example 'I am disputing whether the sale of the earthmoving machinery is zero-rated or not.' Also, indicate what evidence you have to support your explanation. For example, the sale and purchase contract, proof of payment, vehicle registration details.
4.  Set out the main terms of the contract between yourself and the vendor.
5.  Explain what steps you have taken to obtain the tax invoices.

#### Why do you think your proposed change is correct?

Explain why you think your proposed change is correct. You'll need to provide details of the law you are relying on to support your view. If you can’t do this, then you’ll need to provide enough detail so we can identify any relevant legislative provisions for you. You’ll also need to explain how the law applies to the facts. For example, you might state:

I am a self-employed earthmoving contractor. I incurred expenditure on the purchase of earthmoving machinery in the period ended 31 March 2022.

I do not have a GST-inclusive tax invoice for the input tax claim. The vendor considers I have purchased her business as a going concern and I believe I have just purchased the machinery. I have attached a copy of the sale and purchase contract and the tax invoice issued by the vendor showing that the sale has been zero-rated. There is no agreement to zero-rate the transaction in the sale and purchase contract as required for a transaction to be zero-rated as a going concern.

I realise that the vendor is selling all her machinery and will be closing her business as a consequence of the sale. However, I believe that I am just purchasing the machinery and not her entire business.

I have paid the purchase price and the machinery is registered in my name. It came as a surprise to me that the vendor treated the transaction as the zero-rated sale of a going concern in the tax invoice she issued. I am disputing this with the vendor.

I understand that Inland Revenue is under no obligation to allow my input tax deduction if I do not hold a tax invoice showing the amount of GST charged. However, I am providing other evidence that shows that the transaction should not have been zero-rated. In particular, the sale and purchase contract which does not contain any agreement that the transaction is zero-rated.

#### List the documents you’ve attached

In tax disputes you have the responsibility to prove the assessment is wrong. Attach copies of documents you’re aware of that are relevant to the issues you’ve raised. List the documents you've attached. Documents that might be helpful include:

1.  The sale and purchase contract between yourself and the vendor.
2.  The tax invoice provided by the vendor, showing the sale is zero-rated
3.  Bank statements showing the purchase with as much detail as possible.
4.  . Registration of ownership details for the machinery

Guide for completing NOR for GST dispute about omitted cash sales
=================================================================

Here are some suggested entries you might make in a Notice of response (NOR) - IR771 form for this type of dispute. These are a guide only and if your circumstances are similar to the scenario, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your view.

### Scenario

You run a business. The business has four vehicles and 10 employees. Your tax returns are all filed on time. We have investigated your business and identified what we consider to be unexplained cash deposits into your personal bank account.

We send you a Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) proposing that all the 'unexplained amounts' deposited to your personal bank account be treated as income.

You now want to issue a NOR disputing our NOPA.

Generally, you have two months to file your NOR from the date that our NOPA is issued.

### Suggested entries in the NOR

#### What is the change you want? 

Describe the change you want to any amounts on our NOPA. For example, if our NOPA proposes an increase to your income, you might say, 'I agree that $15,000 of the deposits is income but the balance of the deposits are loans from my parents'. Alternatively, if you think the amount you provided on your income tax return was correct then you can just refer to your return (eg 'Refer to income tax return for the year ended 31/03/2022').

#### What facts support the change you want?

Describe the facts and circumstances that support your view that one or more of the proposed changes in our NOPA are wrong. Include any important facts you think we’re missing. If you disagree with our view of the facts then explain how we’re wrong.

If the facts you’re relying on have already been stated in our NOPA, you can say something like 'I am relying on the facts set out in Inland Revenue’s NOPA'. If you have more facts you would like to add you could also say '…with the addition of the following facts…' and then add the additional facts. Relevant facts might include:

1.  Your explanation of where the money came from.
2.  The circumstances that led you to borrow money from your parents. For example, you might state that you completed a big job for a company that is now in liquidation and there is little chance of getting paid. This has resulted in a large loss and a cash shortfall for the business.
3.  The reason why you deposited the money you borrowed from your parents into your personal bank account. For example, 'I thought it would be easier to keep track of it that way'.

#### Why do you think your view is correct?

Explain why you think your view is correct. You'll need to provide details of the law you are relying on to support your view. If you can’t do this, then you’ll need to provide enough detail so we can identify any relevant legislative provisions for you. You’ll also need to explain how the law applies to the facts. If you disagree with our view of the law then explain how we’re wrong.

An example of law is 'a cash loan in these circumstances is not a business transaction'. Some or all of the law may have already been included in our NOPA. If so, you can say something like 'I am relying on the law set out in Inland Revenue’s NOPA with the addition of …'. Then you might also say:

I borrowed the cash from my parents. The amounts are loans that I have to repay. The attached letter from my parents shows the date, amount, term, interest rate and expected repayment for each of the loans. The loan amounts are not income that was earned by the business. The letter from my parents and the copies of my parent’s bank statements indicate the nature of the transaction and where the money came from.

#### List the documents you’ve attached

In tax disputes you have the responsibility to prove the changes proposed in our NOPA are wrong. Attach copies of documents you’re aware of that are relevant to the issues you’ve raised. List the documents you’ve attached. Documents that might be helpful include:

1.  A letter from (or contract with) your parents setting out the details of the loan (ie, date, amount, term, interest rate, repayments).
2.  A copy of the Liquidator’s report for your client company.
3.  Bank statements and details from your parents showing the source of the cash.

Guide for completing NOR for GST dispute about private expenses
===============================================================

Here are some suggested entries you might make in a  Notice of response (NOR) - R771 form for this type of dispute. These are  a guide only and if your circumstances are similar to the scenario, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your view

### Scenario

You run a small business from home as a personal trainer. Your main focus is on athletes involved in adventure ultra-marathon running.

You arrange training camps so that your customers can do specific training on remote ultra-marathon courses. You charge a one-off fee to your customers and in return provide training, advice, accommodation and food.

Your accountant advised you to voluntarily register for GST even though your turnover is below the compulsory registration threshold. You have filed all your GST returns to date.

We’ve investigated your GST returns and identified what we consider to be private expenses claimed as input tax deductions in your GST returns.

We send you a Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) which proposes that the input tax deductions for groceries purchased from a supermarket should be disallowed.

You now wish to dispute the proposed changes in our NOPA and argue that all the expenses you claimed were related to your taxable activity.

Generally, you have two months to file your NOR from the date that we issued our NOPA.

### Suggested entries in the NOR

#### What is the change you want? 

Describe the change you want to any amounts on our NOPA. For example, if our NOPA proposes changes to the amount of input tax deductions, you might say, 'I agree that $800 of inputs were for private expenses but the balance of the expenses were for my taxable activity'. Alternatively, if you think the amount you provided on your GST return was correct then you can just refer to your return (eg 'Refer to GST return for the period ended 31/03/2022').

#### What facts support the change you want?

Describe the facts and circumstances that support your view that one or more of the proposed changes in our NOPA are wrong. Include any important facts you think we’re missing. If you disagree with our view of the facts then explain how we’re wrong.

If the facts you’re relying on have already been stated in our NOPA, you can say something like 'I am relying on the facts set out in Inland Revenue’s NOPA'. If you have more facts you would like to add you could also say '…with the addition of the following facts…' and then add the additional facts. Relevant facts might include:

1.  What your taxable activity involves.
2.  The nature of the purchases. For example, groceries for training camps.
3.  Why you think the expenditure is deductible. For example, 'I keep my personal grocery shopping separate'.
4.  Why the expenditure amount is significant. For example, 'it turns out that ultra-marathoners are a hungry lot and I incurred significant expenditure on groceries for the camps'.

#### Why do you think your view is correct?

Explain why you think your view is correct. You'll need to provide details of the law you are relying on to support your view. If you can’t do this, then you’ll need to provide enough detail so we can identify any relevant legislative provisions for you. You’ll also need to explain how the law applies to the facts. If you disagree with our view of the law then explain how we’re wrong.

An example of law is 'I paid for groceries that were used in my taxable activity and should be allowed an input tax deduction'. Some or all of the law may have already been included in our NOPA. If so, you can say something like 'I am relying on the law set out in Inland Revenue’s NOPA with the addition of …'. Then you might also say:

My accountant advised me before I started my taxable activity to keep my taxable activity and private affairs separate, and I have done so. Groceries were purchased specifically for the training camps. The promotional material for the training camps shows the food and other grocery items provided to customers. The amounts claimed as input tax deductions were only for groceries used in the taxable activity. The receipts show that the groceries were purchased from supermarkets outside my home town.

#### List the documents you’ve attached

In tax disputes you have the responsibility to prove the changes proposed in our NOPA are wrong. Attach copies of documents you’re aware of that are relevant to the issues you’ve raised. List the documents you’ve attached. Documents that might be helpful include:

1.  Promotional material for the training camps. For example, the menus, special dietary requirements, etc.
2.  Analysis of your separate private spending on groceries to show this separate spending was sufficient for personal living.
3.  Testimonials from customers about the training camps and the quality of the food you provided in remote locations.

Generally, you have 2 months to file your NOR from the date that our NOPA is issued.

### Suggested entries in the NOR

#### What is the change you want? 

Describe the change you want to any amounts on our NOPA. For example, if our NOPA proposes to disallow your input tax deductions, you might say, 'I agree that $2,400 of inputs were not for my taxable activity but the rest of the expenses were for my taxable activity'. Alternatively, if you think the amount you provided on your GST return was correct then you can just refer to your return (eg 'Refer to GST return for the period ended 31/03/2022').

#### What facts support the change you want?

Describe the facts and circumstances that support your view that one or more of the proposed changes in our NOPA are wrong. Include any important facts you think we’re missing. If you disagree with our view of the facts then explain how we’re wrong.

I subdivided and developed the land. See attached subdivision consent and invoices from contractors for work completed to the land. I subsequently sold sections of the land in September and November of 2021.
2.  I carried on the activity continuously. I spent approximately 2 years on this project. This involved on average 5 hours of my time each week.
3.  The activity involved the supply of goods to another person for consideration. I sold the subdivided sections as planned to various purchasers. I received $750,000 for the sales. I have attached copies of the Sale and Purchase Agreements and the settlement statements from my lawyer.

Guide for completing SOP for dispute about unexplained cash deposits
====================================================================

Here are some suggested entries you might make in a Statement of position (SOP) - IR773 form for this type of dispute. These are a guide only and if your circumstances are similar to the scenario, you will need to provide specific evidence to support your view.

### Scenario

You run a retail business. The business has two motor vehicles and eight employees. Your tax returns are all filed on time. We have investigated your business and identified what we consider to be unexplained cash deposits into your personal bank account.

We sent you a Notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) proposing that all the 'unexplained amounts' deposited to your personal bank account be treated as business income. You issued a Notice of response (NOR) disputing our NOPA.

You attended a facilitated conference with us. We were not satisfied with the evidence you provided. We still considered the unexplained cash deposited to your personal bank account to be business income, so we issued a Disclosure notice and SOP.

Generally, you have 2 months to file your SOP from the date we issued the Disclosure notice.

### Suggested entries in the SOP

#### What facts support your view?

Give an outline of the facts and circumstances that support your view. Include any important facts you think we’re missing. If you think the amounts in dispute have changed, give the updated amounts.

You could use the facts you listed in your NOR as a starting point. However, the facts may have been further clarified in the facilitated conference so it is important to update them. For example, if our SOP stated that you have not provided evidence of where the cash deposits came from, you could explain the evidence about these cash deposits that you have obtained since the facilitated conference.

The relevant facts might include:

1.  Your explanation of where the cash deposits came from. For example, 'The cash deposits were loans from my parents'.
2.  The circumstances that led you to borrow money. For example, you might say that you sold goods to a client who did not pay you and the business was suffering from a cash flow shortage. And so this was the reason that you borrowed money from your parents.
3.  The reason why you deposited the money you borrowed from your parents into your personal bank account. For example, 'I thought it would be easier to keep track of it that way'.

#### What questions need to be answered to resolve this dispute?

Describe the questions or issues that you think our Disputes Review Unit, the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court would need to consider before this dispute could be resolved. In tax disputes these are usually questions of how a tax law or principle applies to the facts of the dispute. For example, you might say 'the question is whether the cash deposits are my business income'.

It is important to list all the questions or issues that you think are relevant even if you have done so previously because you won’t be able to add any more issues later unless we agree. A judge may allow issues not finalised in your SOP to be raised in court but this is in very limited circumstances.

#### Why do you think your view is correct?

Explain why you think your view is correct. You'll need to provide details of the law you are relying on to support your view. If you can’t do this, then you’ll need to provide enough detail so we can identify any relevant legislative provisions for you. You’ll also need to explain how the law applies to the facts.

It is important to list all the legal arguments or propositions of law that you think are relevant even if you have done so previously because you won’t be able to add any more propositions of law later unless we agree. A judge may allow propositions of law not finalised in your SOP to be raised in court but this is in very limited circumstances.

You can find examples to help you answer this question and information about tax laws by searching our website. You can also refer to publications, court cases and legal principles that support your arguments. For example, if you search our website (search term: 'unexplained deposits') you will find a case that says you need to explain where the cash deposits came from and what they were for.

Some or all of the law may have already been included in our SOP. If so, you can say something like 'I am relying on the law set out in Inland Revenue’s SOP with the addition of …' Then you might also say:

I searched the IR website and found Case TRA 26/11 \[2014\] NZTRA 09. The judge said that if there was proof that an amount was from a non-taxable source then it was not business income. As far as I can tell, a loan is not a taxable source. I borrowed the cash from my parents. The cash deposits are loans that I have to repay. The cash deposits are not income that was earned by my business.

The attached letter from my parents shows the date, amount, term, interest rate and expected repayment for each of the loans. The letter from my parents and the copies of my parents’ bank statements indicate the nature of the transaction and where the money came from. The cash loans are not unexplained deposits, and therefore they are not business income.

#### List the evidence you’re relying on

In tax disputes **you** have the responsibility to prove the assessment or our decision or proposed change is wrong. List the evidence you’re relying on. You don’t need to give the name of any witnesses who may later give evidence for you in the Taxation Review Authority or High Court. Attach copies of documents you haven’t already provided to us. Evidence that might be helpful includes:

1.  The letter from your parents setting out the details of each loan (ie date, amount, term, interest rate, repayments).

A. PRIORITY Value assessment and prioritisation is primarily assessed against the BENEFITS Contribution the initiative makes to one or a combination of the three broad benefits categories: 1. Customer (Compliance effort/cost), including improved experience 2. Government (Expected impact to assessed revenue), and 3. Inland Revenue (Change to IR administration costs), (a more efficient IR) If the above is not the primary contribution but rather a purely Technical Contribution the following three broad categories can be substituted: A: Contribution to Reduction of Risk, B: Reduction or Elimination of Technical Debt and C: Contribution to Operational Cost Savings (a more efficient IR) The assessment is then balanced against the CHANGE Impact which is measured against COST Impact (one-off delivery cost (from scoping to early life support) and/ or o ngoing cost to IR, Work Effort / Complexity (High, Medium, Low), and SCHEDULE impact assessed against impact on the programme or project’s (critical path and/or key deliverable dates). To support the above, Organisation/Customer Impact is assessed and measured against the impact of policy change, a change to the work environment, tools used and/or, skills required, as well as new ways of working. In addition to looking at how the change contributes to achieving benefit and how complex it may be to implement, there are several additional factors to consider when assessing the priority and ranking of an opportunity or initiative: • Reputational risk (to the Ministry, to personal & business privacy and to IR as a tax authority) • Key impacted stakeholders (Business, Individuals, Families, Employers, Government Departments, etc) • Number of Customers impacted (Low, Medium, High) • Critical customer processes impacted (Filing at tax return, receiving entitlements, etc) • Government priorities (Legislation, integrity of the tax system, Crown Accounting, etc) • Business impact (hours per month) • Urgency (when do we need to make the change - measured in months) • Is the function available as a standard feature in an off the shelf application or system or available in the next version/release of IR applications or systems? • Workarounds available (Yes or No) A prioritisation & ranking tool is available to assist in assessing the above. B. MoSCoW Prioritisation Must Do (Committed): No further assessment is required. Qualified, definitely in, Fully Committed, no argument, a Quick Win, required to deliver the programme outcome and/or minimum viable product – no further assessment required.

JIRA uses the Low to Significant value range. D. BENEFITS Contribution Benefit Contribution is used to track the contribution that a scope item makes to the top five benefits listed in the original BT the business plan. (Please see this document for more information about the high-level benefits). Benefits are captured within three broad categories – 1. Customer, 2. Government, and 3. Inland Revenue. It is not expected that a scope item needs to contribute to all benefits. It may contribute at a medium level to multiple benefits. A rule of thumb is to use the highest rating if a scope item contributes across more than one category: Page | 4 https://irnz.sharepoint.com/sites/BT/PMO/lead/IR's Guide to Transformation External Site - Developing the Narrative/Delivering the Transformation (Collateral)/Delivering Learning and Improving/PMO/IR BT Guide to Scope Rating.docx BT Scope Rating \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Benefits Contribution Category Benefits C ontribution Value None Low Medium High Significant 1, 2 and 3 5 and 8 13 and 21 34 and 55 89 and 144 Little to no change < 10% change < 25% change <50% change > 50% change GOVERNMENT (Revenue) Expected impact to and/or additional Crown Revenue Little to no change @$200m/annum ( < $20m p.a.) @$500m/annum (< $50m p.a.) @$1,000m/ annum (< $100m p.a.) $1.5 billion/annum (> $100m p.a.)

Guideline for an increase in costs is only a guideline, not a rule
==================================================================

2012 case note - Court upheld the majority of CIR's claim for increased costs and allowed for full disbursements incurred by the CIR – High Court Rules.

Case

Sovereign Assurance Company Ltd and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, High Court Rules

### Summary

The Plaintiff objected to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's claim for increased costs for trial preparation and for disbursements, including expert witness fees, on the basis that the increased costs were significantly more than the "rule of thumb" (no more than 50% over the scale) and that the Commissioner's expert fees were excessive. The Court disagreed and upheld the majority of the Commissioner's claim for increased costs and allowed for full disbursements incurred by the Commissioner.

### Impact of decision

This case is an example where, due to its complexity, the Court awarded increased costs.

### Facts

On 4 October and 24 October 2012, the Commissioner filed memoranda to the Court regarding costs. The Commissioner claimed the sum of $383,082 for costs (this was an increase on scale costs) and $716,667.45 for disbursements. The Plaintiffs ("Sovereign") disputed the costs claimed by the Commissioner.

### Decision

#### _Costs_

The main component of the Commissioner's cost claim that was disputed was for trial preparation. Band C of the High Court Rules' scale provides an allocation of 14 days for trial preparation. However, due to the nature of the case, the Commissioner claimed 60 days.

Costs for preparation of statements of defence and the first case management conference were also claimed by the Commissioner who sought:

1.  band C in relation to the initial Statement of Defence;
2.  band B in relation to subsequent substantive defences;
3.  band A in relation to amended and consolidated defences; and
4.  one day each for preparation of the case management conference.

Sovereign objected to the 60 days claimed and argued that the claim would be grossly in excess of the guideline or "rule of thumb" that increases are likely to be limited to 50%.

Furthermore, Sovereign calculated that the increase from 14 to 60 days would be a 429% increase and argued that it was beyond any comparable decisions.

Dobson J considered Sovereign's "rule of thumb" argument but took the same approach as France J in _New Zealand Fish & Game Council v Attorney-General_ (2009) 20 PRNZ 557 (HC) at \[15\], that the 50% increase limit is only a guideline and not a rule. Accordingly, his Honour found that the case was vastly complex and granted an allowance of 50 days for trial preparation.

Dobson J upheld the Commissioner's claim in respect of the defences but agreed with Sovereign that costs relating to the case management conference preparation should be reduced from $2,940 to $1,176.

### Disbursements

Sovereign objected to the Commissioner's claim of $514,057.80 for the four United Kingdom-based expert witnesses as being excessive. Rule 14.12(2)(d) of the High Court Rules was relied upon by Sovereign, arguing disbursements can only be awarded to the extent that they are reasonable in amount.

Sovereign also submitted that two of the four experts would be of little assistance to the Court and proposed that the Commissioner should be limited to a recovery of $70,000 per witness for the UK experts.

His Honour was satisfied that it was appropriate for the Commissioner to retain and call each of the experts due to the complexity of the case. Accordingly, Dobson J allowed the full extent claimed under disbursements.

Guidelines for pre-lodgement meetings
=====================================

What's on this page
-------------------

The following guidelines expand on the information contained in the Binding rulings (IR715) guide.

*   [Purpose of a pre-lodgement meeting (PLM)](#Purpose)
    
*   [Information you need to provide before a PLM](#Information)
    
*   [Who should attend a PLM](#Attendance)

*   [Contacting us about a PLM](#Contact)
    

* * *

Purpose of a pre-lodgement meeting
----------------------------------

The purpose of a pre-lodgement meeting (PLM) is to help you decide whether you want to apply for a ruling, and if so, to submit the best application possible.

If you want a draft ruling within three months, you (or your agent) must contact us to arrange a PLM. In this discussion the requirement for a PLM may be waived, for example, if your application is a straightforward reissue of an existing ruling.

We'll use the PLM to:

*   gain a preliminary understanding of the arrangement and issues
*   discuss the scope of the ruling you are seeking (which could help you to focus on the most important issues)
*   tell you the information you will need to supply with your application (for example, relevant documents, specific areas of analysis, or transaction pre-tax and post-tax cash flows)
*   discuss our timeframes
*   tell you about our fees, which are payable irrespective of the outcome of your application.

### Preliminary understanding of arrangement and information needed

A PLM can be held in respect of a proposed arrangement for which the details have not been finalised. We may ask questions about the arrangement at the PLM, point out areas where more details will be required, or identify the documents that we will need you to include in your application. We may also ask for more information once we receive your application and have reviewed the documents in detail.

### Preliminary understanding of issues and scope of ruling

We will not generally give opinions on technical issues at a PLM, as the purpose of a PLM is not to address specific taxation issues. The only exception to this will be where work has already been done on the issues being raised, or there are known public statements of Inland Revenue policy or interpretation. If we consider that you should include or address additional issues in your application (such as s BG 1) we will raise this with you. We will also raise any obvious issues about Inland Revenue’s ability to rule.

### Timeframes and fees

If necessary, we can explain our three and six month delivery standards at the PLM. In situations where there are compelling transactional requirements, we can sometimes meet requests for a faster delivery time, and can discuss this at the PLM.

If possible, we will provide an indication of the likely fee range. However, we will provide you with a formal estimate (which will be calculated using the hourly rate of $161 including GST) once we receive your application. There is no charge for a PLM.

* * *

Information you need to provide before a pre-lodgement meeting
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you ask for a PLM, you must intend to apply for a binding ruling (although you may later change your mind).

The level of detailed information you provide for the PLM will vary, depending on the stage in the commercial process that you are at. As a minimum, you will need to provide a summary of the facts and taxation laws on which a ruling will be sought, as well as the identity of the applicant – PLMs are not held on a "no names" basis. You do not need to provide a draft application, and it is not necessary to have final (or even draft) documents prepared before the PLM. However, you can provide any of this information if you want to.

Where possible, you should provide this information at the same time that you request a PLM. If this isn’t possible, the information should be provided to us at least a week before the PLM.

* * *

Who should attend a pre-lodgement meeting
-----------------------------------------

Ideally, a representative from the applicant(s) and their tax agent should attend the PLM. In most cases, at least one representative from Service Delivery and one representative from the Taxpayer Rulings Unit of Inland Revenue will attend.

We try to allocate an application to the Inland Revenue staff members who attended the PLM, but this is not always possible (especially where there is a long delay between the PLM and the application being made). The Commissioner does not guarantee that the staff members who attend the PLM will be those who work on the application.

* * *

Relevant timeframes for a pre-lodgement meeting
-----------------------------------------------

Except in exceptional circumstances, we are not able to hold a PLM within one week of a request for a meeting being made. Having this notice helps us to ensure that the right people can attend. A PLM will usually last no more than an hour, although complex arrangements may take longer.

* * *

Location of a pre-lodgement meeting
-----------------------------------

PLMs will usually take place over Microsoft Teams (or similar). There is no need for a PLM to take place in person however we can often accommodate meeting in person, if you prefer.

* * *

Agenda for a pre-lodgement meeting
----------------------------------

A formal agenda is not necessary for a PLM. Generally, a PLM will cover:

*   introductions
*   a summary of the arrangement
*   the issues on which the intended ruling will be sought
*   the information you (as the applicant) will need to provide with your application
*   timeframes
*   an estimate of our fees
*   next steps.

* * *

Delays in lodging an application

Gun buy-back scheme
===================

01 August 2019

The New Zealand Government launched a gun buy-back and amnesty scheme which includes compensation payments being paid for **firearms, parts, magazines and ammunition**. This is effective between 20 June and 20 December 2019.

The general tax treatment of compensation payments is provided below.

If you have more questions or want to know specific tax treatment of your compensation payment please contact your tax agent or contact us.

[Contact us](/contactus/general-enquiries)

For information around the scheme itself refer to the New Zealand Police website.

[New Zealand Police website](https://www.police.govt.nz/advice/firearms-and-safety/firearm-law-changes-prohibited-firearms)

### Recreational hunters and shooters, hobbyists and other personal use

There are generally no tax consequences for receiving compensation for **firearms, parts, magazines or ammunition** intended only for personal use.

Any payment received under the scheme is not taxable. Any loss incurred is not tax deductible.

But, if your main purpose or intention when buying was to sell the items for a profit, you may be liable to pay tax on any profit you have made. See the information under **Buying and selling - traders and dealers** below.

### Firearm used as part of a business – farmers, professional hunters and other sports

There are tax obligations you need to meet if you received compensation for firearms bought and used, or planned to use, as a part of a business and claimed the cost as an expense or claimed depreciation.

**Revenue expense:** If you deducted the cost of the original purchase, you must treat any payment you received as income to the extent of the initial deduction. You are required to return this in the income year in which you receive the compensation payment.

**Capital expense:** You may have treated firearms as a capital asset and depreciated the original cost. In this case, you'll have either depreciation recovery income or a depreciation loss.

Deduct your payment from the asset’s adjusted tax value (book value). If the resulting amount is a positive amount this is income. If it is a negative amount this is a depreciation loss.

#### Example

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase cost (GST exclusive) on the depreciation schedule | $5,000 |
| Book value at 1 April 2019 | $2,000 |
| Compensation payment received | $6,000 |

The difference between the compensation payment and the purchase cost is a non-taxable capital gain ($1,000).

The difference between the compensation payment and the adjusted tax value (less the non-taxable capital gain) is depreciation recovered ($3,000). You must return it as income for income tax purposes.

#### Example

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase cost (GST exclusive) on the depreciation schedule | $5,000 |
| Book value at 1 April 2019 | $2,000 |
| Compensation payment received (GST exclusive) | $1,000 |

The difference between the compensation payment and the book value is a loss on disposal ($1,000). You can claim it as a deduction for income tax purposes.

There are different rules where an asset was only partially used for business purposes or if the asset was in an asset pool.

To find out more about depreciation and what adjustment you need to make when disposing of business assets, refer to Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260.

[Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-expenses/depreciation)

If you're GST registered and have already claimed an input tax deduction for the original purchase or any subsequent adjustments, then exclude GST from the payment amount before working out your depreciation income or loss.

**GST:** If the business is registered for GST then any payment is considered payment for a taxable supply. You must include it in the return for the period in which you receive the compensation payment.

**No payment:** Firearms may have been handed in and destroyed and no payment was received. In these cases, treat the payment as zero and use the treatment described in the relevant situation(s) above.

### Buying and selling - traders and dealers

Whether a payment received under the scheme is taxable depends on several factors and we advise you seek independent tax advice for your situation.

Some factors to consider when determining if you are a dealer or trader include:

*   nature of your activities
*   period engaged in these activities
*   the scope of the operation
*   the volume of transactions undertaken
*   commitment of time, money and effort
*   pattern of activity, and
*   financial results achieved by the activity.

It is likely the payment is taxable income if the firearms, parts, magazines or ammunition were acquired:

*   as part of a trading business
*   with the intention of reselling at a profit
*   as part of a scheme or undertaking to make a profit.

If the gun was purchased with more than one purpose, the main purpose or intention at the time of the original purchase applies.

You may be required to provide evidence to support your position so ensure you retain adequate records.

### Investor

Whether any payment received under the scheme is taxable depends on the main purpose or intention for the items at the time of their original purchase.

A brief overview is included above in **Buying and selling - traders and dealers**.

Hamilton brothers sentenced after major tax evasion case
========================================================

**17 October 2019**

Two Hamilton brothers have been sent to prison for significant tax and charities fraud.

In the Hamilton District Court this week, Judge Kevin Phillips sentenced 61-year-old truck driver Lindsay Scott to 3 years 6 months in prison. His older brother Roger, a 64-year-old lab technician, was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.

The two men were the remaining defendants in a major Inland Revenue prosecution against the Scott family group which also saw their sister Jillian, a former chartered accountant, sentenced to community detention and community work in April.

An associate, Martin Pim, was sentenced in April last year for operating a ‘trust’ and signing fraudulent donation receipts.

Inland Revenue spokesperson Richard Philp says over a 7-year period, the brothers and their sister, carried out a complex scheme to evade taxes and obtain fraudulent refunds from IR, primarily at the direction of Lindsay Scott.

“To make the scheme work, the Scotts incorporated 8 fraudulent companies and 10 supposedly charitable, non-profit entities. In fact, none of the entities undertook any charitable purpose,” Richard Philp says.

“The family members registered companies for GST on the basis of property developments, claimed GST refunds on property purchases and fictitious expenses, which then provided a basis for claimed losses to be offset against their incomes.

“Some of the properties were never even purchased, and the ‘property development’ amounted to no more than wall papering, while they and family members lived in the properties.

“The family members also used the companies and charitable entities to circulate funds through a ‘merry-go-round’ of transactions to give the appearance of genuine charitable donations. They then falsely claimed charitable donation rebates providing each other with receipts and thank you letters

“The shell entities were, in fact, created with the sole intention of extracting fraudulent GST refunds and donation rebates.”

Lindsay, Roger and Jillian Scott collectively claimed GST and Charitable refunds amounting to $594,821 through their group offending.

Lindsay Scott was sentenced for earning more than half a million dollars of undeclared income from which he evaded the assessment and payment of $103,785 of income tax over a ten-year period.

He also fraudulently claimed $4,652 of Working for Families tax credit while receiving a benefit.

“In sentencing on Tuesday, the judge recognised the aggravating factors in what the brothers did, in particular the abuse of the charities regime,’ Richard Philp says.

“Both brothers were entirely unremorseful. They didn’t accept blame for what they did or take responsibility for what they’d done.  They tried to paint themselves as victims because IRD had allowed them to make the claims. 

“People who rip-off the tax system are stealing from ordinary New Zealanders. Inland Revenue staff put a lot of time and effort into this successful prosecution because we believe it’s important to protect the integrity of the tax system and to make sure there’s a level playing field for all taxpayers.”

UNCLASSIFIED PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 18/04 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Harbour Fund III G.P. Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BD 1(4), BD 1(5), BG 1 and YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt by Harbour Fund III LP (the Fund) of proceeds (Proceeds) under individual funding agreements that the Fund will enter into with litigation claimants (the Claimants) in a proposed class action against Steel & Tube New Zealand Limited and/or Steel & Tube Holdings Limited (Steel & Tube) (and possibly other steel manufacturing companies) under which the Fund will agree to pay all legal and other costs incurred by the Claimants in return for a share of the Proceeds. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The offshore parties to the Arrangement 1. The Fund is a limited partnership registered in the Cayman Islands and has been established to make litigation and arbitration funding available for all types of claims other than personal injury, divorce or defamation proceedings. The Fund is not a trustee of a trust. 2. Under the law of Cayman Islands, the Fund does not have separate legal personality from its partners (Limited Partners). The Fund is not the beneficial owner of its assets, which are held by Harbour Fund III GP Limited (the General Partner), in accordance with the terms of the Fund's limited partnership agreement. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 3. The Fund provides funding for litigation claimants all around the world who have met certain criteria. The criteria include the creditworthiness of the defendant, the legal merits of the case, the expertise of the legal team and the likely legal fees. 4. The Fund is advised by Harbour Litigation Cayman Limited (the Investment Advisor) a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The Investment Advisor has been contracted by the General Partner under an investment advisory agreement (Investment Advisory Agreement) to perform investigation, evaluation and due diligence services in respect of potential claims for which funding is sought. 5. Preliminary investigation and due diligence services have in turn been subcontracted by the Investment Advisor to Harbour Litigation Funding Limited (the Sub-Advisor) which is a company incorporated in England and Wales, under a sub-advisory agreement (Sub-Advisory Agreement). 6. Details of the activities undertaken by the Investment Advisor and by the Sub- Advisor (together the Advisors) when investigating and evaluating potential claims are set out below. Summary of the normal investment procedures 7. The Advisors ensure that the business of the Fund is known to interested parties. However, the Advisors do not actively or routinely seek to identify and locate specific claims for which funding might be provided. 8. Once a request for funding is received a confidentiality agreement is entered into, and the Advisors conduct a preliminary assessment. Information is gathered regarding the claim, and an immediate analysis is conducted to assess whether the claim is likely to satisfy the Fund's criteria. If the claim is unlikely to satisfy the criteria, it will generally be rejected at this stage. 9. If a claim passes the first stage of analysis, the Sub-Advisor will, if appropriate, enter into a letter of intent, usually with the claimant directly, but in the case of a class/group action, with the legal representative seeking funding on behalf of the claimants. This procedure has been adopted because there are too many claimants to execute separate documents with and they may not yet have been identified. The Sub-Advisor will then conduct a more detailed due diligence to ascertain whether the claim would be likely to meet the criteria for funding. 10. An Investment Committee established by the Investment Advisor then meets every few weeks to evaluate the legal merits of the cases for which funding is sought which satisfy the Fund’s criteria. The Investment Committee also receives updates on the progress of existing funded claims. 11. At the conclusion of each meeting the Investment Committee, where appropriate, make a formal recommendation to the Board of the Investment Advisor, about investing in proposed new claims. The Investment Committee also reports to the Board of the Investment Advisor on existing funded claims if there have been material adverse developments in the case of existing funded claims. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 12. The Board of the Investment Advisor then considers the recommendations made by the Investment Committee at its monthly meeting. Where the Board of the Investment Advisor considers that a proposed claim is likely to meet the Fund's criteria for funding, a recommendation is made by the Board of the Investment Advisor to the Board of the General Partner, which has the authority to invest in claims on behalf of the Fund. 13. The Board of the General Partner then meets to consider the recommendations made by the Board of the Investment Advisor. 14. Where the Board of the General Partner (on behalf of the Fund) considers that a recommended claim is meritorious, the Fund will make funds directly available for the claim by entering into a funding agreement or funding agreements with the claimants. How the decision to fund this Claim was made 15. The Sub-Advisor was approached in June 2016, via email, by Adina Thorn of Adina Thorn Lawyers, in relation to the possible funding of a representative action in relation to the quality of seismic mesh and the supply of non-compliant seismic mesh for use in building construction, predominantly in and around Christchurch. The potential claim, would be based in negligence and breach of statutory duties, and was expected to involve over 317 Claimants with a claim for damages in excess of NZ$44 million (the Claim). This matter was the subject of an investigation and subsequent prosecution by the Commerce Commission. 16. In accordance with the normal procedure summarised above, this approach for funding was subjected to the preliminary review and assessment process. It was subsequently concluded that the Claim could potentially satisfy the Fund's criteria. 17. Due diligence was then undertaken by the Advisors, and ultimately a recommendation was made to the Board of the General Partner that the Claim be approved for funding. 18. At its July 2017 meeting in the Cayman Islands, the Board of the General Partner approved the Claim for funding. 19. The parties then attended to the finalisation of anticipated timetables and funding amounts, and appropriate documentation was prepared for the Fund to record the terms on which funding would be provided to Claimants. 20. A draft of the funding agreement (Funding Agreement) was prepared, to record the terms on which the Fund will make funding available to Claimants for their legal and other costs incurred in relation to the Claim. A draft relationship agreement (Relationship Agreement) was prepared to record the various invoicing and reporting requirements that will apply to the legal representative (Legal Representative) acting for the funded Claimants throughout the proceedings (Proceedings). 21. The Relationship Agreement was finalised and entered into on 2 August 2016 by the Board of the General Partner and the Legal Representative. At the date that 4 UNCLASSIFIED this Ruling is signed Adina Thorn Lawyers are the Legal Representative, but the Claimants have the ability to appoint a replacement Legal Representative. The Funding Agreement was finalised by 29 June 2018 with Claimants progressively entering into the Funding Agreement from that time. Funding Agreement 22. The Funding Agreement records the terms on which the Fund agrees to make funds available to Claimants (ie, individuals or groups who have suffered damage within the scope of the Claim) for the “Claimant’s legal costs” (Claimant’s Legal Costs). The phrase Claimant’s Legal Costs is defined in cl 20.1 of the Funding Agreement. It includes legal fees incurred in relation to the Claim, and any costs incurred by the Claimants (subject to certain exclusions) should the Claimants be ordered to pay the legal costs of the defendant or any other party involved in the Claim. Under the terms of cl 9 of the Funding Agreement the Claimants have agreed that in the event that the Claimants are successful, the Fund will receive the Proceeds. 23. The Claimants will comprise individuals, groups of individuals and companies (or their respective representatives, such as liquidators or administrators) that are home and building owners, affected by defects in the design and/or manufacture of seismic mesh used in their homes and buildings. 24. Virtually all of the Claimant group is located in New Zealand, and all of the properties to which the Claim relates are located in New Zealand. This Ruling only considers or rules on the Arrangement to the extent it relates to New Zealand properties. Funding process 25. Funding for the Claimants Legal Costs will be made available under the Funding Agreement in two stages. The first stage comprises the point up to which all the pre-conditions for full funding are satisfied, and a statement of claim has been filed. 26. The Applicant advised that due to the process of confirming Claimants taking time, Claimants will be confirmed as being part of the Claimant group on a progressive basis during the first stage of funding. Claimants will continue to be confirmed up until (and potentially after) the time that the statement of claim is filed. It is possible that Claimants could be confirmed and enter into the Funding Agreement after the second stage of funding has commenced. 27. During the first stage, legal fees will be incurred for work which will benefit all Claimants including Claimants who are accepted towards the end of the first stage. The definition of Claimants Legal Costs (cl 20.1 of the Funding Agreement) overcomes a potential problem associated with the timing of, and allocation of, legal costs, which were incurred before a Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. This clause provides that Claimants will agree that each Claimant's proportionate share will be allocated by reference to the value of their claim, regardless of when each Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. 5 UNCLASSIFIED 28. Provided that the Claim satisfies the preconditions for full funding, the Fund will, after the completion of the first stage, fund the second stage of the Claim. Funding will be provided for the second stage of the Claim until such time as the Fund terminates its obligations under the Funding Agreements or the Proceedings are concluded (whether by settlement or judgment of the courts). Fund's entitlement to Proceeds 29. In the event that the Fund funds stage one and two of the Claim, and the Claim is successful, the Fund will be entitled to receive the Proceeds. The amount of the Proceeds will be calculated on the basis set out in the Funding Agreement. Clause 9.1(a)(i) to (vi) outlines how the Proceeds will be allocated between the Fund and the Claimants. 30. In accordance with the Funding Agreement, the Legal Representative will receive and hold any damages, costs and settlement sums received in respect of a Claim on bare trust for the Fund and the Claimants in the proportions agreed until such time as the relevant amounts are paid to the Fund and to the Claimants. All amounts received from the defendant must first be paid to the Fund who will be paid in priority to the Claimants, who shall each receive such sum as is equal to their share of the remaining damages, costs or settlement sum. Control of Claim 31. Control of the Claim will rest with the Claimants. The Fund will have no ability to instruct the Legal Representative or dictate how the Proceedings are to be conducted. Clause 5 of The Funding Agreement expressly acknowledges that the Fund has no control over or right to make decisions about the Proceedings. Only the Claimants, through the Representative Claimant (Representative Claimant) may instruct the Legal Representative and determine, for example, the claims that will be pursued and what actions will be taken or decisions made on a day to day basis in respect of the conduct of the Proceedings. 32. Clause 6.1(e) of the Funding Agreement provides that at any time Claimants will be entitled to change the Legal Representative. While the prior written agreement of the Fund is required, this clause provides that the Fund’s consent to such a change is not to be unreasonably withheld. However, in order to continue to receive funding under the Funding Agreement, the Claimants will be required to ensure that the new Legal Representative executes a deed in favour of the Fund under which the new Legal Representative agrees to be bound by the terms of the Relationship Agreement as if they were the prior Legal Representative. 33. Clauses 5, 6 and 13 of the Funding Agreement outline the Claimants obligations under the Funding Agreement. They include taking certain actions and to provide certain instructions to the Legal Representative in relation to certain anticipated future events including: in relation to the pursuit of an appeal should the Fund wish to provide funding for an appeal, and in relation to settlement decisions should settlement be recommended or not recommended (as the case may be) by the Legal Representative. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 34. The Applicant states that because this is a class action, Claimants will also agree on entering into the Funding Agreement the manner in which the Proceedings will be conducted and the Representative Claimant will instruct the Legal Representative. This is to ensure that the funded Claimants agree at the outset how the Proceedings will be conducted, and so that the Fund can be confident that the Proceedings are being conducted in an optimal manner. Termination 35. Clause 1 of the Funding Agreement contains an initial cooling off period of 20 days. Clause 12 of the Funding Agreement provides that a Claimant will not be able to unilaterally terminate its obligations under the Funding Agreement. Claimants will only be entitled to actively terminate their obligations if there has been a material breach by the Fund which has adversely affected the Claimant's interests and which has not been remedied by the Fund within 30 days. 36. Clause 12 of the Funding Agreement enables a Claimant to opt out of the class action if the Claimant gives instructions to the Legal representative or otherwise exercises a right to opt out of the Proceedings. However, if the Claim is subsequently successful the Fund is still entitled to recover its share of the Proceeds as if the Claimant had not opted out of the class action. 37. Clause 11 of the Funding Agreement provides that the Fund will have the right at any time to terminate its obligation to contribute to future legal costs in respect of the Claim. Key contractual terms relating to process 38. Claimants will agree to take certain actions and provide certain instructions to the Legal Representative in relation to the manner in which the Proceedings will be conducted, and in relation to certain potential future events. These obligations are contained in the following clauses of the Funding Agreement: • Clause 5: Conduct of Proceedings. • Clause 6: Claimant’s Obligations. • Clause 9: Application of Proceeds and Interim Recoveries. • Clause 13: Settlement Decisions. • Clause 19: General Provisions. 39. Under cls 5, 6 and 13 of the Funding Agreement, each Claimant will agree: • That the Representative Claimant will determine, in consultation with the Legal Representative and without direction from the Fund, what claims will be pursued (cl 5.1(a)). • That the Representative Claimant will, without direction from the Fund, give day to day instructions to the Legal Representative and will make binding decisions on behalf of Claimants (cl 5.1(c)). • That the Claimant will provide all information and documents required by the Legal Representative, will deal promptly with all requests made by the Legal 7 UNCLASSIFIED Representative and will co-operate generally with the Legal Representative (cls 6.1(m) to 6.1(o)). • That the Claimant will act reasonably and commercially in the prosecution of the Proceedings and in accordance with the advice of the Legal Representative (cl 6.1(d)). • That the Claimant will accept and follow the Legal Representative’s reasonable legal advice including advice in relation to settlement (cl 6.1(i)). • That the Representative Claimant is authorised to make or take any action constituting a settlement decision provided that the Legal Representative has advised such action is reasonable (cl 13.1). • That the Legal Representative is authorised to and instructed to accept on the Claimant's behalf, any settlement proposed where the Claimant has not initially wanted to act in accordance with the advice of the Legal Representative and the matter has been referred to independent counsel for opinion, with the independent counsel having recommended that the Legal Representative’s advice is reasonable in all the circumstances (cls 13.3 and 13.4). 40. In addition, each Claimant will agree under the Funding Agreement that the Fund is entitled to communicate directly with the Legal Representative, and that the Fund is entitled to receive any information which has or may have a material impact on the Claim and/or the Proceedings (cls 5.1(d) and 6.1(b)). The Relationship Agreement between the Legal Representative and the Fund 41. The terms and conditions in the Relationship Agreement are consistent with the above provisions in the Funding Agreement. The Relationship Agreement provides that the Legal Representative must: • Act consistently with all authorisations and instructions given by the Claimant as contemplated in the Funding Agreement, subject to having received such instructions or authorisations (cl 2.4). • Only enter into a “Retainer” (as that term is defined in the Relationship Agreement) with a Claimant if the Claimant gives the Legal Representative all the authorisations and instructions contemplated and referred to in the Funding Agreement (cl 2.5). • Ensure the Claimant is given all necessary information to facilitate informed instructions (cl 8.2). • Keep the Fund fully informed by providing a monthly report in the form set out in the Relationship Agreement (cl 8.1(b)) and until Proceedings are issued provide a fortnightly report in relation to the progress of the book build and other matters (cl 8.1(a)). • Give the Fund access to, and when requested provide the Fund with copies of, all material documents produced by or for the Claimants in relation to the Proceedings (cl 8.1(c)). • Immediately inform the Claimant, and in accordance with the Claimant's instructions as contemplated in the Retainer and the Funding Agreement, 8 UNCLASSIFIED notify the Fund if the Legal Representative becomes aware of any information which has or may have a material impact on the Claim (cl 8.2(b)). • Immediately notify the Fund in the event that the Claimant receives a settlement offer, and prepare for the Claimant a written recommendation on whether to accept such an offer and provide a copy of that recommendation to the Fund (cl 8.1(f)).

\[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Haukāinga (Intelligent Information Project) Change Management & Communications Case Study Domain Principal – Change Management, ED&I BT Communications Specialist 21/12/2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What were we trying to solve? Business transformation had delivered a range of new IKM tools and capability, however there were still some challenges to be addressed to ensure our people could access the information and insights needed to perform their roles more effectively: -Existing intranet platform to be retired and content to be mo ved to new Corporate Space in Sharepoint. -IR Knowledge Base also needing to be transitioned from e xisting platform and START Help did not have the functionality to offer a guided help experience– a new solution needed. -Multiple new systems for managing documents and i nformation but not yet integrated, and confusion about which tools to use for what purpose (e.g. collaboration, short/long term storage). -No effective search engine that could operate across source s ystems or provide intelligent search functionality. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Project objective \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Stage 1 – Developed guided help for a small number of high-use topics. Expanded use of guided help to customer facing website. Stage 2 – Move from IRIS to Corporate Space, and the new homepage ‘Haukāinga’. Connected search functionality to corporate space Sharepoint. Stage 3 – Connected up STAX and other information sources. Stage 4 – Refined and improved the search functionality. Development of Te Mātāwai knowledge centre and move from IRKB. Project stages \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Project Approach •The IR project team worked in partnership with an external vendor, who led the experience design/co-design using an AGILE methodology. •Their experience led approach involved conducting workshops and in terviews with a range of people from different parts of IR. •These were followed by interaction concept testing in which participants w ere observed while using the new tools and changes were made based on their feedback. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Change Management Approach •Haukāinga had a broad impact: all IR staff would see a change, but for most the impact is low-medium – they will still have access to the information and systems to do their job and there are no changes to our core systems. Exceptions to this were for our content editors and owners who needed training in Sharepoint. •The aim of the change management approach was to have an ‘organic’ uptake of Haukāinga by targeting i nfluential groups, team meetings, webinars and word of mouth – ‘actively engage’ rather than be ‘told to use it’. •Our approach was to be business led and to enable people to become familiar with the change in a way that didn’t consume a lot of time or effort by our people, in particular our team leaders and front-line. There were also major releases for START happening in the same timeframes, alongside organisation design changes, building disruptions and Covid. Old sites and tools were still available for a period so low risk as people still had access to what they needed. •Low key did not mean low effort from a change an communications perspective – t here was a significant amount of work put into developing effective communications and stakeholder engagement throughout the project. •The change management method was to do an initial high-level impact assessment based on user groups, then a mini impact assessment and change plan for each phase/launch as the solution was developed e.g. Corporate Space, Guided help, Haukāinga, Connecting Up. This approach meant we were able to adapt and tailor activities for each phase and learn from previous phases. •Engagement with people in the business, particularly CCS/contact centres was critical to determine how big a c hange this was and how much effort needed to be put into supporting people e.g. through training, communications, info packs etc. •Ourch ange manager attended UX sessions to see how people were using the new tools, what they were finding difficult, how they reacted. The new system was shown to be easy to use and navigate, and features could be changed/added easily based on user feedback. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The key behaviour change required was to get our people to use the search functionality rather than navigating through links (search first). This is important as the search function can return a lot of information from the different sources that are connected up to Haukāinga, and some existing links would no longer be available (although a number were retained e.g. Links to MIRI, ATEA, START). Up to this point there had not been an effective search engine on the IR intranet, and other repositories such as STAX, sharepoint were not connected. •Based on our impact assessment and user experience testing, we determined that training not required for anyone e xcept content editors -instead we did demo videos and supporting FAQ's for Haukāinga and guided help. The CCS team also did their own videos to support and communicate with their teams. •Work was also done with the IKM team to raise awareness about privacy/security - ens uring source documents were correctly classified in the native systems, being open about the data that is collected by the Haukainga platform e.g. What is being searched for, frequency etc. -a rich source of information to help with refining functionality and seeing how people are using the tools but not at an individual level. •Corporate space - us ed 'content owners' to update content, trained them in how to use Sharepointto edit/maintain their content. •The switch over to Corporate Space, with the launch of new Haukāinga home page and search functionality was the most visible component....but transition was designed in a way that everyone still had what they needed until they got used to the new sites. •We used a ‘soft launch’ approach for guided help initially, choosing a few topics to begin with and encouraging peo ple to try using the new tool. •The full launch of Te Mātāwaii n July 2021 took place with the tax and social policy content transitioned from START help, again with an approach of encouraging use and gradual uptake with START help still available for a period. From October 2021 the Tax Law Community Site was migrated, as well as new sites for Child Support and Tax Technical Quality Assurance. The Child Support cohort were the first group to go through their START training using Te Mātāwai. Change Management Approach \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The communication approach A people-led approach to communications In an organisation already experiencing change fatigue and a busy communication environment with many competing messages, the project was committed to ensuring communication activity was meaningful, engaging, timely and reflected the people-led approach to Haukāinga. This meant: •Focusing on need-to-kn ow over nice-to-know •Making it real for people, e.g. T his is how it will make your work-life easier •Making it interactive and giving people the opportunity to contribute to the design •Working alongside influential teams to reach the right people in the right way O ften this meant thinking outside the box, rather than relying on traditional communication channels. Agile communications A separate communications plan was created for each phase. Communications was the major focus of the change effort. Developing a Haukāinga identity Using the IR branding, a visual identity was created for Haukāinga to ensure communication activity was instantly recognisable as relating to the project. Having already worked with the Mahutonga team to select the name, we sought their guidance on imagery and develop pronunciation resources. Multi-channel approach We knew there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach, especially with competing – and higher- priority – communication activity. We had a varied approach to suit the masses but also target the high priority groups. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The communication approach Making it real through gamification Haukāinga as a concept was very new for IR, and very different to the traditional concept of an intranet. This meant it was even more important to help people understand the benefits early, so they would be in a good position to adopt the tool. Part of this involved creating an overarching story to help people understand the core concepts of intelligence led, and the how Haukainga would fit in the ecosystem along with Stax, DIP, START, Corporate Space, and O365. The other part was making it real and relatable to IR roles. One way we did this was develop a workshop game for the 2019 people leaders forum. Teams were asked to take on the persona of a ComCom employee and purchase information to help them make a decision. As the game progressed, we moved from traditional information systems (like M: Drive) to our new, more sophisticated systems (like Haukāinga). The information became more valuable to their decision making but cost them less (signifying the evolution of our data and information systems). It also helped to build understanding of how information and knowledge could be connected to users through Haukāinga to ultimately improve quality decision making. In total, around 300 people completed the 45min workshop –leaders, union representatives and information management staff. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The communication approach Facilitating the people-led design Communication activity helped the continue the people-led design of Haukāinga, something that had been important since the inception of Haukāinga. With limited options for interactivity across traditional IR communication channels, the Haukāinga project became an early adopter of Teams Live and was one of the first groups to begin embedding Slidointo its webinars. Each webinar was developed with three purposes: 1.Show previews and recent development –P articularly relating to outcomes of previous polls 2.Address feedback/issues 3.Invite feedback on an upcoming design decision ( D esign decisions related to new functionality, font and colour preferences, and how people prefer to find the information they need. The results of each poll was reported back to the project team to help guide decision making. The webinars were open to all, but particularly geared towards the change champions network as a group who could influence people in their areas of the business. The average live viewership was ~300 people, with several hundred more watching recordings. \[Information redacted\] \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The communication approach Working alongside the influencers As a project team made up predominantly of contractors, it was important that Haukāinga had an IR voice and –like the project – was delivered by IR for IR. In some cases, that meant including quotes or delivery full communications from respected internal stakeholders. This included a one-off video update from CIRand regular updates to IIS. Team leaders were provided with a ‘meeting in a box’ to equip them to talk with their teams about Haukāinga, as part of our ‘leader led’ change approach. Developed by CCS for CCS Some of our most successful activity involved taking a lead from CCS reps. Working with representatives from CCS, we got greater insight into the communication channel and style preference of CCS people. This led to the co-development of a series of in-house videos featuring CCS people, as well as the development of a virtual treasure hunt using puzzle pieces to encourage people to explore Haukāinga using the search functionality. Embedding the right search behaviours with IKM Working with the knowledge management experts within IKM, we were able to develop fun and engaging videos that promoting 'search first' to get people using the search functionality rather than using links/favourites–The Adventures of Barry. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Outcomes •Use of H aukāinga, and the search functionality continues to increase steadily. •Achieved our vision of ‘our true home’ and a seamless tr ansition from the old intranet with very little fuss. •Feedback on guided help/ Te Mātāwaive ry positive and uptake continues to grow. •Now have ability to publish new topics at pace both i nternally and externally. E.g. for Covid related information. •The team continue to refine and improve Haukāinga and T e Mātāwai. \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Thank you.

What is omnipotent in this world  
It is people, it is people, it is people

I te tau ka huri ko te mate urutā ā-ao te take nui, ā, he nui ngā pānga mai ki tā mātou mahi. Nā ā mātou pūnaha hou i tere ai tā mātou urupare ki ngā huringa ture me ngā huringa kaupapahere, i tū ai ētahi kaupapa katoa i roto i ngā rā ruarua me ngā wiki ruarua hei tautoko i te urupare mate urutā a te Kāwanatanga. Nā tēnei i āwhina ngā pakihi maha kia mahi tonu i te wā aro haehae mō rātou. Kāore hoki i taea tēnei momo horo i mua i te hurihanga nui.

Kua heke iho te rahi o ngā waeatanga mai mā te 30% mai i te tau o mua, i te kore hoki e whai take ināianei o te nuinga ki te waea mai. Hei tauira pai hoki tēnei mō te whakamahi hangarau e wātea ake ai ngā tāngata tērā i torotoro rawa mai ki a mātou i mua.

I raro i ngā tukanga o mua, he maha ngā tāngata i āhei ki te tono whakahokinga moni engari kāore i tutuki nā te matatini me te uaua rawa. Nō te whakatikanga o te whakawhiwhi aromatawai taake takitahi, he nui atu ngā tāngata e whiwhi ana i ngā whakahokinga moni e tika ana. Kei te takiwā o te 90% o te pūtea whakahokinga moni e $455 miriona katoa i tukuna atu i mua i te 30 o Hune 2021 i haere ki ngā kiritaki iti ake ā rātou utu ā-tau i te $70,000 tāra.

Nā ngā tātaritanga kōrero hou, kua mārama ake mātou ki ngā whanonga kiritaki me ngā ara āwhina kia tika ai tā ngā kiritaki. E āhei ana hoki mātou ki te tohu i ngā putanga hou o te mahi tinihanga ka whakarite ai hoki i te urupare tautuku e tika ana.

Kei te kaha tonu mātou ki te whakapakari i te āheinga o ō mātou tāngata. Nā ngā hurihanga ki tā mātou aro whakahaere, kua whai tūranga ā-pūkenga rātou, ā, e ākina ana rātou kia mahi kōtuitui puta noa i Te Tari Taake.

He Kupu nā te Kaikōmihana
=========================

I te tau kua hori, kua mau tonu te arotahi a Te Tari Taake ki ngā mahi hei whakangāwari, hei whakamāmā i te taake mō ngā tāngata takitahi me ngā pakihi, me tōna 99.2% o ngā puka whakahokinga taake ka tukua matihikotia mai i 2023–24.

Kei Aotearoa nei, he tino pai te nui o te tautuku tuao, arā e tata ana ki te 90% ngā utu ka utua i te wā tika i tēnei tau. Ka tuku āwhina mātau ki ā mātau kiritaki e raruraru ana ki te utu i ā rātau kawenga taake.

Kua piki te whiwhinga taake o Aotearoa ki tōna taumata teitei rawa i tēnei tau, arā kua tae ki te $115.4 piriona te whiwhinga taake mō te tau 2023–24. Kei tōna 10.5% nui ake tēnei i tērā o 2022–23. Ka mau tonu tā mātau arotahi ki ngā mahi hei whakangāwari, hei whakamāmā hoki i te taake me ngā takuhe, ā, ka whaiwhai hoki i te hunga kāore i te tautuku mai.

He tuku uara mā ā mātau mahi
----------------------------

I te tau kua hori, i whakahou mātau i tā mātau rautaki pakihi, ka whakapūmau ai i ā mātau tino kawenga ki te mahi tōtika, whaitake hoki, ki te āta tiaki i te pūnaha taake, kaupapahere papori hoki, ki te whai wāhi hoki ki te rāngai tūmatanui mā te mahi tahi.

E hāngai ana te aronga o tā mātau rautaki, me te kawenga tonu ki te mahi tōtika, whaitake hoki, ki ngā mahi hei āwhina i a mātau ki te whakatutuki i ngā whakaarotau o te Kāwanatanga mō te whiwhinga taake.

Nā te whakatutukitanga pai o tā mātau hōtaka whakarerekē pakihi i waenganui o 2022, kua takotoria tētahi kaupapa totoka hei whai atu mā mātau, me te huarahi hoki ki te whakawhiwhi atu i te uara nui ake ki ngā tāngata o Aotearoa. Ko te tau whakamutunga tēnei mō te whakapūrongo i ngā hua o te hōtaka nei, ka taea te panui ētahi kōrero anō mō ngā huanga kei konei.

[Outcomes of the transformation programme](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2024/our-performance/our-services/residual-activities-following-the-transformation-programmes-substantive-closure/outcomes-of-the-transformation-programme)

Ka oti i Te Tari Taake ngā tini kaupapa te whakatutuki i tēnei tau kia pai ake ai te tōtika me te whaitake o ā mātau ratonga. Ka kite koe i ngā kōrero mō ētahi o ēnei kaupapa ki roto i tēnei Pūrongo ā-Tau.

I tēnei tau, kua piki mātiratira ake te nui o ngā nama e tōmuri ana, he āhuatanga tēnei ka hua mai i te taiao ohanga e uaua ana. Kei te whakatōmua mātau i ngā mahi ki te whakahaere, ki te whaiwhai hoki i ngā nama e tōmuri ana, kei te heipū atu ki ngā nama nui te uara, nui te mōrearea hoki, pēnei i ngā kiritaki e nui ana te nama, ā, e rite tonu ana te hapa o ngā utunga mai.

He tokomaha ngā kiritaki whai nama kua āta mahi tōrunga mai ki te whakatau i te nama, pēnei i te whakarite i te utu harangotengote tae atu ki te $4.3 piriona o te noho nama, ā, kua utua tōna $461 miriona o tēnei tae mai ki te 30 o Pipiri 2024. Ko te āheinga o ngā kiritaki ki te whakarite i ā rātau ake whakaritenga tētahi o ngā panonitanga ki roto i te whakahoutanga. Mai i te Pepuere o 2017, arā ko te wā tērā i tīmata ai te āhei kia pēnei te mahi a ngā kiritaki, he nui ake i te 150,000 ngā whakaritenga kua utua, e eke ana ki te $1.5 piriona.

Puta noa i ā mātau mahi tautuku, kua arotake mātau i te $975 miriona whiwhinga tāpiri, ka raua atu ki tēnei ko te $230 miriona o ngā whakahokinga taake me nga whakaitinga taake e hapa ana, e tinihanga ana rānei i kitea i roto i ā mātau pūnaha, aukatia i te wā o te tuku mai i te puka taake. Ko ngā pūkenga tātari i hua mai ai i te whakahoutanga ka whakaāhei i ngā momo arotake i te wā tonu o te kurutetetanga, mā reira e tautokona ai te tautuku, e whakamanawatia mai hoki ngā kiritaki. Ka taea ināianei te arotake tere i te mōrearea e pā ana ki ia kiritaki, ki ia kiritaki.

Kua whakapiki hoki mātau i ā mātau mahi uruhi i tēnei tau mō ērā kiritaki ruarua ka kōwhiri kia kaua e whai i te ara tika. He nui ake ngā tātari kaute me ngā whakamāngohetanga kua oti i a mātau i tēnei tau, tērā i ērā o te tau kua hori. He mahi ēnei ka whakatipu i te whakapono mai, ka

whakamanawa hoki tērā mehemea kei te mahi hē te tangata ka whakauruhi atu mātau.

Ka raua atu ki ngā whakaarotau o te Kāwanatanga hou nei, ko te whakamōrahi i ngā whiwhinga taake, ko te whakaiti i ngā utu mā ngā kiritaki me te whakamāmā i ngā hātepe. I te Tahua Pūtea 2024, ka whakawhiwhia Te Tari Taake ki ētahi pūtea hou kia nui ake ngā mahi tautuku hei whakapiki i te whiwhinga taake. Kei te ū mātau kia $4 te whakahokinga moni mō te $1 ka whakapaua hei 2024–25, ka mutu ka piki atu tērā ki te $8 mō ia $1 hei ngā tau o anamata. Ka tautoko te pūtea i te whakapikinga o ngā whakatewhatewhanga me ngā tātari kaute, ka mutu ka aro hoki ki ngā mahi kohi nama i ngā tāngata noho nama ā-tauira e noho ana ki tāwāhi. Kei te kōkiritia ēnei mahi ki te taha o ngā mahi tautuku o mohoa noa nei.

Te āwhina i ngā kiritaki
------------------------

He mea nui ki a mātau te whakakanohi atu ki ngā hapori e mahi nei mātau, kua whakatū mātau i ngā awheawhe taake mā ngā pakihi me ngā tāngata mahi takitahi, kua toro atu ki ngā kiritaki 1,600 koni atu ki te whakamārama i ā mātau ratonga, ki te kōrero hoki mō ngā āwangawanga.

I haere tonu ā mātau kaupapa whakamōhio, tae noa atu ki tētahi kaupapa e aro ana ki te rāngai hanganui nāna i hua mai ai he whakapikinga tautuku, me te whakanoho mai hoki o te nama e $1.2 miriona ki roto i ngā tikanga utu harangotengote.

I runga i te whakaarotau o te Kāwanatanga ki te whakaiti i ngā utu tautuku mō ngā tangata takitahi me ngā pakihi, kua haere tonu tā mātau tirotiro he aha ngā mahi ka taea hei āwhina i ngā pakihi iti-waenga hoki (SMEs). Kei te mahi hoki mātau ki te whakaiti i te rangiruatanga mō ngā pakihi nui mā te whakarato i te tikanga whakahaere e hāngai pū ana ki ngā pakihi nui rawa.

Ka tautoko tā mātau Te Tari Tohutohu Tāke i ngā mahi tautuku mā te mārama me te pūmau hoki o ngā ture taake kia māia ngā kiritaki ki te whai wāhi atu ki ngā kurutete tauhokohoko.

Hei āpiti atu ki ngā mahi kohikohi whiwhinga taake, ka whakahaere hoki Te Tari Taake i ngā tini takuhe kaupapahere pāpori. Tērā ko tōna āhua 336,000 ngā kiritaki ka whakawhiwhia ki mō ngā takuhe taake o Working for Families Tax Credits, ka whakarite hoki mātau i ngā utu tautoko tamariki mō ngā tamariki 145,000 me ngā tukunga KiwiSaver mā tōna 3.4 miriona ngā tāngata o Aotearoa.

Nō te wāhanga tuatahi o 2024, i āta mahi tahi mātau ki Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora me Te Tāhuhu o te Mātauranga ki te whakarite i ngā mahi hei whakatinana i a FamilyBoost, arā ko te utu hoki a te Kāwanatanga ki te whakahoki i tētahi wāhanga o ngā utu kura kōhungahunga. Ka taea ināianei te kawe atu ngā taonga me ngā ratonga hou kia tere ake ai, kia māmā ai hoki te utu nā runga i te whakahoutanga.

E whakatairangatia ai te mōhio ki tēnei kaupapa hou, me ētahi atu panonitanga ki Working for Families Tax Credits i puta mai i te Tahua Pūtea o 2024, i whakahaere mātau i ētahi kaupapa whakatairanga tuihono kia puta atu te rongo ki te tokomaha o ngā tāngata e māraurau mai ana.

Ko te mahi tahi mā ngā tāngata o Aotearoa
-----------------------------------------

Ehara i a mātau anake ā mātau mahi. Ka mahi tahi mātau me ētahi atu tari kāwanatanga ki te whakawhiwhi ngātahi i te uara e nui ake ana. Ka mahi tahi hoki mātau ki ētahi hoa rangapū puta noa i te taiao taake, tae atu ki ngā kaitakawaenga, ngā kaiwhakawhiwhi pūmanawa rorohiko, ngā rōpū ā-rāngai me ngā rōpū hapori hoki, rātau katoa ka whai wāhi atu ki te tautoko i ā mātau kiritaki.

E whakaritea ai e toitū ana a Aotearoa ki roto i ngā kaupapa taake ā-ao, ka mahi tahi hoki mātau ki ngā whakahaere ā-ao me ngā whenua rangapū ā-taake o Aotearoa ki te tautoko i ngā mahi ā-ao ki te whakarite ka utu ngā tāngata katoa i te taake e tika ana ki a rātau.

I te tau kua hori nei, kua kawea e mātau te whakawhiwhi atu i ā mātau ratonga ki roto i tētahi taiao ā-ohanga, ā-pūtea hoki e taimaha ana, kua nui hoki te tono mahi i ā mātau tāngata. E whakahī ana au ki ngā mahi e kōkiri nei rātau i ia rā ki te tuku huanga tōrunga ki ngā whakatipuranga o Aotearoa o nāianei, o anamata hoki.

We've helped people to get things right and stay on track
=========================================================

Everything we do is aimed at helping people to pay the right amount of tax and get the right social policy payments. This influences how we design policy, products and services; the advice and education we provide; and how we approach investigations and litigation.

We use our analytical capabilities to identify where customers are not getting things right and decide how we can help them. We might text them or let them know through myIR. If it's something a lot of customers are getting wrong, we might send texts or put messages out on social media.

For instance, we called more than 5,000 customers this year, including people newly in business or just elected to Māori authorities, to work through their tax obligations and any issues they may have.

We also reached out to 250,000 customers in April 2022 to let them know about new reporting requirements for trusts and we've continued to explain to people that they may need to pay tax on profits from the sale of a property.

Show all

We're doing more to help people avoid surprise tax bills when they sell a property

The bright-line property rule means people may need to pay tax on any profits from selling a house within 10 years of buying it. People do not have to pay tax when they're selling their main home or an inherited property.

This year, we've continued to make more people aware of bright-line by communicating online to build awareness, sending information to tax professionals, conveyancers and solicitors and holding webinars.

We can now identify sales that may fall within the bright-line rule. Every month we're in touch with between 500 to 800 people who've recently sold a property to let them know that they may have tax to pay.

To make it easy for customers, when we become aware of a sale, we pre-populate information in the property section of their myIR account and alert them to check out this information. This year, we've also started pre-populating information in the customer's bright-line residential property sale information form (IR833) as an attachment to their tax return, unless they'd told us the rule does not apply. We expect customers to include the income in their tax return, and we check to see that they have.

Our compliance framework

Our compliance framework reflects what we've aimed to achieve through our transformation programme - collecting more revenue for New Zealand, with less effort by us and our customers.

### We design the tax and social policy system with compliance in mind

The left side of the framework shows how we design tax policy, systems, processes and guidance to help about 95% of our customers get their tax obligations right.

### We use analytical tools to help ensure people comply

The centre of the framework shows the tools and intelligence capabilities we use to act in real time, and identify and assist customers who need more help to comply with their tax obligations.

### We have interventions for people who do not comply

The right side of the framework shows the interventions we can use with the very few customers who need more help to get things right or more of our attention because they deliberately try to avoid their obligations.

Hidden economy campaign – IR visits hospitality businesses
==========================================================

**29 October 2019**

Inland Revenue compliance staff have searched several Central Otago businesses and made unannounced visits to others, as part of its current hidden economy campaign targeting the hospitality sector.

Café, restaurants, bars and takeaways are the focus of the renewed campaign which follows the successful prosecution of five siblings in the Thai House case.

Inland Revenue spokesman Richard Philp says the recent visits to Queenstown businesses have confirmed the sector has a high risk of cash sales not being reported and employees being paid under the table.  

“We certainly observed those behaviours during our visits. Using court issued warrants, Inland Revenue staff seized wage records, computers and other business records. Staff also seized information on employer provided accommodation, rental properties, working for Families Tax credits and payroll matters,” Richard Philp says.

“Some of the items we removed includes information on staff paid in cash without PAYE being deducted and documents detailing cash deposits in to private bank accounts without being returned for GST and income tax purposes.

“On unannounced visits we seized till records and lists of staff names and work rosters to check against employee details we hold.

“During the operation, a number of taxpayers referred unprompted to the Thai House case and were aware IR was conducting search activities in Queenstown outside of normal business hours.”

Since the operation ended two businesses have indicated they will make voluntary disclosures.

“It’s early days yet in the investigations but it’s always good to see taxpayers or their agents contacting us early after a compliance visit, wanting to make a voluntary disclosure. It helps the taxpayer as they receive a reduction in the penalties imposed,” Richard Philp says.

“Also, we appreciate that investigations can be stressful, and we work with taxpayers to resolve matters in a timely manner so they can get on with their business."  

As a taxpayer, you can also tell IR voluntarily about your own tax situation especially if you think there’s something wrong with your tax returns because you’ve left out some cash sales [https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure](https://www.ird.govt.nz/tasks/make-a-voluntary-disclosure)

Richard Philp says most hospitality businesses are paying the right amount of tax and have good bookkeeping practices but there are still those that don’t.

“Knowing the books are all in good order takes a huge weight off a business owner’s shoulders and means they can sleep easy knowing they have good records,” Richard Philp says.

“We visited more than 30 taxpayers in Arrowtown, Queenstown, and Frankton to talk about our ‘Sleep Easy’ campaign and left information about record keeping with them. We want to support businesses to keep good records and ensure a level playing field for all.

![Sleep Easy magnet](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2019/hidden-economy-campaign--ir-visits-hospitality-businesses/sleep-easy-1-for-follow-up-media-release.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221306&hash=C2BBA308F5F9ACF1FD032D23966BB1DE)

“Everyone should pay their fair share of tax because that’s what pays for the essential things that make New Zealand a great place to live,” Richard Philp says.

If you think someone’s not being honest about their tax you can anonymously report tax evasion [https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html](https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/tax-crime/report/report-tax-evasion.html)
 or you can contact Inland Revenue if you think hospitality businesses are not declaring their full earnings [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#147c7b67647d6075787d606d547d66703a737b62603a7a6e)

High Court backdates charity's registration and confirms that the transitional definition of "tax charity" does not apply once a charity is registered
======================================================================================================================================================

2014 case note – Applicant's registration as a charity backdated so that its registration was continuous and it was not liable for income tax while deregistered.

Case

In re The National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated; The National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZHC 3200

Legislative References

Charities Act 2005, Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The High Court backdated the National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated's ("NCW") registration as a charity so that its registration was continuous. The NCW was, therefore, not liable for income tax during the period it was deregistered.

### Impact of decision

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") is required to refund the tax paid by the NCW.

The transitional definition of "tax charity" in s CW 41(5)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA") has limited application so there are no considerable wider implications for this case.

### Facts

This case involved two proceedings. The first proceeding was an appeal by the NCW against the decision of the Charities Registration Board ("CRB") not to backdate the NCW's registration beyond the date of its application to be registered as a charity ("the appeal").

The second proceeding was a challenge by the NCW against the tax assessed against it by the Commissioner during the period that it was not registered as a charity ("the tax challenge").

The NCW is a charitable organisation established in 1896. On 4 June 2009, following the enactment of the Charities Act 2005 ("CA"), the NCW was registered as a charity by the Charities Commission ("CC"). The effective date of registration was 30 June 2008.

On 22 July 2010, the CC revoked the registration decision with effect from 19 August 2010 ("the date of deregistration").

On 10 September 2012, the NCW applied to the CRB, the successor to the CC, for reregistration as a charitable entity. The NCW requested that it be registered from the date of deregistration so as to avoid any potential exposure to income tax during the period of its deregistration.

On 15 April 2013, the CRB granted the NCW's reregistration application but with effect from 10 September 2012, not 19 August 2010. That meant that during the period from 19 August 2010 to 10 September 2012 ("the deregistration period"), the NCW was not registered as a charity.

The Commissioner assessed the NCW for income tax for the deregistration period on the basis that it was not exempt from income tax.

### Decision

#### _The appeal_

Counsel for the NCW argued that s 20(2)(b) of the CA is to be interpreted literally. She contended that as the NCW had lodged a properly completed application on 28 May 2008, the CRB's backdating power could have applied to any date after 28 May 2008.

Dobson J disagreed. His Honour found that the power to backdate registrations was "of a more confined scope", and that the CRB did not have the discretion to backdate under s 20 of the CA where there had been a deregistration decision (following an initial application and acceptance as a charitable entity) and a second application to the CRB (at \[38\] and \[40\]).

However, his Honour went on to consider whether the Court itself had a wider power to backdate under s 61 of the CA. Section 61(4) of the CA states that the High Court "may make any other order that it thinks fit".

Dobson J found that s 61 afforded wider powers to the Court on appeal than those granted by the CA to the original decision-maker (at \[52\]). Given the overall purpose of the CA is to encourage and promote the effective use of charitable resources, he concluded that an order backdating the NCW's registration to the date of deregistration was justified. Accordingly, his Honour ordered that the NCW is to be registered as a charity from 19 August 2010 (at \[55\]).

#### _The tax challenge_

The order backdating the NCW's registration was sufficient to resolve the tax challenge (at \[56\]). As previously acknowledged by the Commissioner, backdating the NCW's registration removed the basis for the assessments and, in those circumstances, the tax paid is to be refunded.

However, in case he is found to have been wrong in making that order, Dobson J went on to consider the competing positions raised by the parties.

In respect of the NCW's argument that it was a "tax charity" under the transitional definition in s CW 41(5)(b) of the ITA because it had started to take reasonable steps in the process of preparing an application for registration before 1 July 2008 and intended to complete the process of applying for registration, Dobson J stated that there was "an artificiality" in the NCW's contentions (at \[70\]). He stated:

*   … NCW cannot accurately be described as having taken reasonable steps in the process of preparing an application before 1 July 2008 when it had in fact completed and lodged the application prior to that date. Furthermore, it is artificial to treat NCW as having an intention to complete the process of preparing an application from 1 July 2008, when the product of that work was already lodged with the Commission.

Dobson J stated that the NCW was "inarguably outside the scope of the transitional provision in paragraph (b) because it was registered" and that "there are no circumstances in which it could reasonably be contemplated that the transitional provision in paragraph (b) of the definition would be resurrected" (at \[71\] and \[72\]). Accordingly, his Honour rejected the NCW's interpretation of the definition of "tax charity" in s CW 41(5) and upheld the Commissioner's contention that the transitional provision in s CW 41(5)(b) ceased to apply when the NCW lodged its application for registration with the then CC (see \[66\]).

In respect of the NCW's argument that the Commissioner had a discretion to recognise it as a tax charity throughout the period of its deregistration, Dobson J accepted the Commissioner's position that there was no such discretion in s CW 41(5) to allow a care and management solution. He found that the Commissioner does not have discretion to disregard the law.

Accordingly, Dobson J stated that if he was wrong in backdating the NCW's registration, then he would dismiss the NCW's tax challenge.

High Court clarifies that the insuring of an identified risk is not a financial service and the premia paid are not exempt from tax pursuant to ss 3(1)(h) and 3(1)(l) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================

The Court found that the premia paid in insurance policies were not exempt from tax under the financial services exemption.

Case

Provident Insurance Corp Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 995

Legal terms

Financial services, Insurance policies, Premia, Indemnity, Security, Payment of principal interest of other amount whatever

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, s 3 and 14  
Interpretation Act 1999, s 5  
Evidence Act 2006, s 25  
  

### Summary

The Court found that the premia paid in insurance policies where the policy covers an identified risk for a borrower’s loan repayments on the occurrence of a specified insured event, or a policy which covers the difference between the total loss-pay out received from a motor vehicle insurer and any outstanding loan where a car is written off, were not exempt from tax under the financial services exemption.

### Impact

This decision clarifies the position that the insuring of an identified risk is not a financial service and the premia paid are not exempt from tax pursuant to ss 3(1)(h) and 3(1)(l) of the Goods and Services Act 1995 (“the GST Act”).

### Facts

Provident Insurance Corporation Limited (“Provident”) is a specialist insurance company offering a range of products connected with the automotive industry. These products are designed to mitigate risk in relation to the repayment obligations for credit contracts for the purchase of motor vehicles, including:

1.  the Credit Contract Indemnity (“CCI”) policy which covers a borrower’s loan repayments upon the occurrence of specified insured events; and
2.  the Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) policy which, in the event a vehicle is written off in an accident, will cover the difference between the total loss pay-out received from a comprehensive motor vehicle insurer and any outstanding loan balance.

In addition to the CCI and GAP policies, Provident also offers mechanical breakdown insurance and comprehensive motor vehicle insurance. Provident accepts that GST is payable in respect of the premia it receives under these two types of policy. However, Provident asserts that the CCI and GAP policies fall within the financial services exemption set out in s 3(1) of the GST Act.

### Preliminary matter – admissibility of expert evidence

Before the Court could consider the substantive issue at hand, a preliminary issue regarding the admissibility of a brief of evidence needed to be decided. The evidence consisted largely of expressions of opinion of an expert for Provident. The Court considered s 25 of the Evidence Act 2006 determines whether the evidence was admissible or not.

The Court noted that as there was no dispute of relevant fact in these proceedings, it did not need to “ascertain any fact”. The issue was whether the Court was likely to obtain substantial help from the opinions of the expert in relation to other evidence in the proceeding. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) also called an expert in tax policy, solely in case the Court held that the evidence of Provident’s expert witness was admissible.

The Commissioner submitted that the Courts have consistently expressed their disapproval of legal submissions being included in witness statements in similar proceedings, (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Ltd_ \[2009\] NZCA 47, (2009) 19 PRNZ 553 at \[28\]), and objected to the fact that the brief of evidence introduced into evidence a number of documents such as a GST commentary/guide prepared for the insurance industry (_GST Co-ordinating Office Handbook on the Fire and General Insurance Industry_ (April 1986)), and three Government discussion documents on GST (Inland Revenue _GST: A Review_ (March 1999); Inland Revenue _GST and Financial Services_ (October 2002); and Tax Working Group _Future of Tax: Interim Report_ (20 September 2018)). The Commissioner submitted that the Court only takes into account a limited number of sources of extrinsic materials such as Hansard, Bills, explanatory notes to Bills or reports from Parliament’s Select Committee. The Commissioner also referred to the disapproval expressed by the Supreme Court in _Penny v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 95, \[2012\] 1 NZLR 433 at \[32\] (_“Penny v Commissioner of Inland Revenue”_) of the practice of including what are legal submissions in the brief of expert taxation witnesses.

The Court noted that there were no “facts of consequence” to the determination of these proceedings that were required to be ascertained. The Court did not accept that the decision in _Lin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 969, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-016 (_“Lin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue”_) is authority for the proposition that New Zealand Courts accept expert tax witnesses giving their opinions about the policy underpinning a provision in New Zealand tax legislation that the Court is required to interpret. The Court of Appeal in _Lin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ followed the practice referred to in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v JFP Energy_ \[1990\] 3 NZLR 536 (CA) at 54 per Richardson J.

The Court held that the Australian case law referred to by counsel for Provident did not seem to relate directly to the type of evidence in issue here, and to the extent that there was any divergence in approach between the Australian and New Zealand Courts on this issue, his Honour preferred the approach outlined by the Supreme Court in _Penny v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_.

The Court also noted that the evidence of Provident’s expert witness was, in large part, legal submission and that no exception could have been taken to it if the evidence had been presented by counsel.

The Court held that the evidence of both Provident and the Commissioner’s expert witnesses amounted to legal submissions. His Honour was accordingly unable to place any weight on it and held it to be inadmissible.

### Decision

The Court held that Provident had not shown that, on the balance of probabilities, the Commissioner’s assessments were wrong. The Court held as follows:

1.  The purpose of the GST Act is to levy a consumption tax on the widest possible range of goods and services with as few exceptions as possible.
2.  Payment of interest and principal are not payments for the supply of goods and services and were intended to be exempt. As a consumption tax, the purpose of GST was not to tax savings, resulting in the exemption of, for example, life insurance policies, retirement schemes and the like.
3.  To reduce the “self-supplier of services” bias that could be included within an exempt interest charge, the definition of financial services was drafted so as to include services in the nature of brokerage and intermediary services provided other than by financial institutions. However, the reasons behind that exemption do not apply in relation to an insurance policy that is separately priced and provided by a different party to the party who charges interest under the credit contract.
4.  Apart from brokerage and intermediary services, it was not the purpose of Parliament to exempt services connected with the provision of financial services but not themselves financial services.
5.  There is no identifiable policy underlying s 3(1) of the Act that differs from the overall policy of the Act set out above.
6.  The nature of a supply for GST purposes is determined by the contractual relationship between the supplier and the recipient of the supply. The fact that the services supplied may benefit another party in relation to a contract of financial services did not transform what were, in this case, insurance services provided pursuant to a contract of insurance into exempt financial services.
7.  In its natural sense, a contract of indemnity is between two parties, one of whom contracts to make good the losses sustained by the other as a result of loss caused by a third party. This is fundamentally different to a contract of insurance where the insurer agrees, for the payment of a premium, to pay money to, or for the benefit of, the other party to the contract in the event of the happening of an insured event, see _Chitty on Contracts_ (33rd ed, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 2015) Vol 2 at \[44-001\].
8.  If Parliament had intended the use of the word “security” in a very general sense such as “something that secures or makes safe” or “anything that makes the money more assured in its payment or more readily recoverable”, then the words surrounding it in s 3(1)(h) of the GST Act (guarantee, indemnity and bond) would be unnecessary as they could all be described as something “that makes money more assured in its payment or more readily recoverable”.
9.  The word “security” is clearly capable of bearing the meaning “security over real or personal property”. Placement of the word in the context of words such as guarantee, indemnity and bond support the interpretation that the narrow or particular meaning of “security” in accordance with the Black’s Law Dictionary definition was intended.
10.  The principles articulated by the Court of Appeal in _Wilson & Horton Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1996\] 1 NZLR 26 (CA) at 33, were determinative. The financial service in question was the provision of a contract of insurance. The parties were the insurer and the insured. A contract of insurance was not a credit contract. Although the financier may have had certain claims against the insurer pursuant to the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, that was a different issue as to whether the insurer was party to the credit contract. The credit contract was solely between the financier and the insured. The insurer obtained no rights in respect of it. There was no contract of indemnity between the insurer and the financier, and the fact that the financier might have benefited as a result of the provision of insurance services to the insured did not result in the insurer supplying exempt services to the financier.
11.  In analysing whether or not the service provided by Provident amounted to the payment of interest or principal pursuant to ss 3(1)(ka) and 3(1)(l), it was necessary to reflect on the nature of the insurance contracts. The premium was payable by the insured at the commencement of the insurance contracts. It was that premium that was subject to GST. There was no further or additional premium payable if an insured event occurred. In many, perhaps most, of the policies, there would not be any insured event and there would be no payment by Provident on behalf of the insured to a finance company. The service being provided was insuring the identified risk, which was not a financial service. In that respect, the service provided by Provident under the CCI and GAP policies was identical to the service it provided under its other policies.
12.  Just as in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Databank Systems Ltd_ \[1990\] 3 NZLR 385 (PC), the supplier of the service that is connected to, or involved in, a financial service provided by someone else is not itself the supplier of a financial service.

High Court clarifies the meaning of “year” for calculating “ongoing daily care” for the Child Support Act 1991
==============================================================================================================

When there is change to ongoing daily care of a child across two child support years, the calculation of the percentage change to ongoing daily care is not split into two separate child support years.

Case

P v Commissioner of Inland Revenue & Ors \[2018\] NZHC 98

Legal terms

Year, Ongoing daily care

Legislative References

Child Support Act 1991

### Summary

When there is change to ongoing daily care of a child which falls across two child support years (as defined) the calculation of the percentage change to ongoing daily care is not split into two separate child support years.

### Impact

The judgment is an important one for the administration of child support and for changes in the ongoing daily care of a child. The judgment recognises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") practice when calculating whether there has been a change to the percentage of ongoing daily care (of not splitting it into child support years) is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the Child Support Act 1991 ("the Act").

### Facts

This was a judicial review of a decision by the Commissioner regarding child support.

P provided ongoing daily care for her daughter. The father lived in Australia and paid child support. By agreement between P and the father, the child went to stay with the father in December 2017.

There was some disagreement between P and the father about the intended length of the child's stay. P considered the stay would be a short term one that fell over two child support years. She considered this was two short term stays split over two consecutive child support years. The father considered it would be for the long term. The child stayed with the father until July 2018.

The father advised Inland Revenue that the child was living with him. The Commissioner took the view there was a change of circumstances in the ongoing daily care of the child. The father's child support liability was adjusted to nil. P was advised she would no longer receive child support payments.

P objected on the basis the stay was a "three month per year" change using a child support year. On that basis her ongoing daily care of the child did not drop below 35% in any given child support year. The Commissioner disallowed the objection on the basis the Commissioner must give effect to any change in circumstances from the day before the date the liable parent (the father) ceases to be liable under s 25 of the Act. In this case the date P ceased to provide 35% of the ongoing daily care. The Commissioner did not consider she was constrained to using "child support year" but made the calculation commencing on the day before the day the care fell below 35% of the ongoing daily care.

### Decision

Justice Palmer accepted the Commissioner's position. His Honour expressly stated:

*   \[2\] I do not accept the child support year is the only possible basis for calculating the period over which ongoing daily care is assessed. Usually, the relevant period can be expected to be the term of the arrangement, or the period of the regular pattern, of care being assessed by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will need to assess whether short term changes to an arrangement or regular pattern change the overall relative proportions of care on the basis of the circumstances of each case. The key requirement on parents is to be clear in agreeing on their childcare arrangements and to communicate that to Inland Revenue.

His Honour noted there was neither an explicit statement specifying the period over which the costs of caring for a child are to be calculated (at \[17\]) nor a definition of "ongoing daily care" (at \[19\]).

His Honour considered the general scheme and purpose of the Act and, in particular, the purpose of amendments to the Act in 2013 to recognise changes in patterns of parenting since 1991. His Honour continued:

*   \[34\]The legal issue in this case centres on the meaning of "ongoing daily care" and how a percentage of ongoing daily care is calculated. In particular, s 25(3)(b) provides liability ceases when the receiving carer ceases to provide "at least 35% of ongoing daily care". But 35 per cent of ongoing daily care over what period? The Act does not say. Neither does the legislative history. I have found no case law that is directly on point. The cases about who was a "principal provider of ongoing care" or "shared care" under the previous legislative regime do not assist.

*   \[35\]I do not accept P's submission that the child support year is the only possible basis for calculating the period over which ongoing daily care is assessed. That is inconsistent with the purpose of the 2013 amendments in taking into account a wider range of circumstances. Sections 79 and 80 support that by enabling the Commissioner to make an assessment on the basis of less than a year. The relative capacity of parents to provide financial support and their relative levels of care, recognised in s 4(d), must not be determined artificially or mechanistically according only to the Act's definition of a child support year. Rather, it must equitably reflect the circumstances of those involved.

Justice Palmer recognised the Commissioner's approach was pragmatic and consistent with the Act provided the Commissioner genuinely examines the circumstances of each case and does not apply her policy mechanically (at \[38\]).

Tax Administration Act 1994 – ss 89AB, 89AC, 89D(5), 89H(2), 89K, 138P  
Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 – s 26A  
Interpretation Act 1999 – ss 7, 18

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") Notice of Response ("NOR") was filed within two months of the decision by the Taxation Review Authority ("the TRA") that the Commissioner should have accepted the Doug Vesey Trust's ("the Trust") Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") out of time pursuant to s 89K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("the TAA"). In her judgment, Peters J upheld the finding of the TAA that the Commissioner's NOR was filed in time and there was no deemed acceptance of the Trust's NOPA.

### Impact

The judgment makes it clear that both prior to and subsequent to the amendments to ss 89AB and 89AC of the TAA, the Commissioner's NOR is not required until two months after the conclusion of s 89K challenge proceedings. There is no valid NOPA until the hearing authority determines that the Commissioner should have accepted a taxpayer's NOPA out of time. The Commissioner is not required to issue a "protective" NOR in these circumstances.

The judgment also clarifies that, pursuant to s 138P(2), where the disputable decision is not an assessment, the hearing authority's powers are limited to directing the Commissioner to alter her decision, i.e. in this case to issue a s 89K(1) notice.

### Facts

A GST return was filed by the Trust on 5 November 2008 for the period ended 31 October 2008, claiming a refund of $625,000.

On 16 April 2013, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Assessment ("NOA") in respect of that return. She assessed the refund due for the period as "nil".

In order to be within the four month response period the Trust was required to issue a NOPA in response by 16 August 2013. A NOPA was not issued until 30 March 2015 but was accompanied with a request under s 89K that the Commissioner accept the NOPA out of time.

By letter dated 29 April 2015, the Commissioner notified the Trust that she refused to accept the NOPA and that, as a consequence, the Trust was deemed to have accepted the Commissioner's NOA.

In May 2016 the TRA held that the Commissioner ought to have not refused the Trust's late NOPA and set aside the Commissioner's refusal. The Commissioner then issued a NOR within two months of the TRA's decision.

This led to the second hearing before the TRA, and ultimately to this appeal. The Trust contended that the Commissioner's NOR was out of time and, by s 89H(2), the Commissioner was deemed to have accepted the Trust's NOPA and must refund the GST claimed.

Amendments to ss 89AB and 89AC of the TAA came into force on 24 February 2016 ("the amendments"). In the decision under appeal the TRA held the amendments applied and were determinative of the issues. The appellant contends they did not apply.

### Decision

_Response Period_

The appellant's NOPA was of no effect when it was issued on 30 March 2015 (s 89D(5),  TAA).

Section 138P(2) permits the TRA, if it upholds a challenge, to direct the Commissioner to alter her decision – for example to direct the Commissioner to issue a s 89K(1) notice – and the Commissioner must do so. Accordingly, even on a successful challenge under s 89K(6), the most the TRA may do is direct the Commissioner to issue a s 89K(1) notice. Her Honour held that the notice will be in the same terms and the same effect as one given by the Commissioner of her own volition. That is, it is that notice which renders the late-filed document effective and it does not matter that the notice may be issued under a direction from the TRA or the High Court. Therefore, a late filed document becomes effective when the 89K(1) notice is issued and that the time starts to run against the Commissioner from then and not before.

Her Honour held that there is no relevant statutory provision which suggests that the

Commissioner should issue a NOR "just in case" a taxpayer brings a successful challenge to her refusal. She added that there is no good reason to require the Commissioner to devote resources to issuing a NOR that might not be required and that there was no prejudice to a disputant in allowing the challenge procedure to run its course before requiring the Commissioner to take a further step.

The applicable response period for the Commissioner's NOR did not start to run prior to the TAA's decision in May 2016, and was issued in time.

_Did the amendments apply?_

The Judge held that although the words of s 89AC(b) do not reflect the procedure in s 138P(2),the meaning is clear enough. Time starts to run from the date the TRA upholds the challenge or the Commissioner concedes.

The Judge did not accept the appellant's arguments that as the Trust's dispute commenced before the amendments were passed, that they did not apply. She held that the commencement section of the legislation and the commencement provisions for other amendments to Part 4A of the TAA, make it clear that the amendments were to be applied to all, as yet, undetermined disputes.

High Court clarifies when payments made in support of overseas mission services qualify for tax credits
=======================================================================================================

As part of its overseas mission programme, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints expects applicants to commit to raising a “standard amount” towards supporting the Church’s missionary work.

Case

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Trust Board and Coward v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 52

Legal terms

Missionary, Overseas, Donations, Donor, Gifts, Tax credits, Charitable, Public benefit

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007, s LD 1

### Summary

As part of its overseas mission programme, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ("the Church**"**) expects applicants to commit to raising a "standard amount" to go towards supporting the Church's missionary work. The Trust Board of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ("the Trust") is the Church's New Zealand-based entity which receives the "standard amount" payments for New Zealand resident applications and provides the donors (including the plaintiff in the second proceeding, Mr Coward) with deduction receipts.   
The High Court had to consider whether the "standard amount" payments qualified as "gifts" under s LD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act") and therefore whether tax credits could be claimed for such payments.  The Court held that payments made to the Trust by a missionary, their parents, and/or grandparents were not "gifts", while payments by other relatives and friends were.

### Impact

This is an important judgment that clarifies the scope of s LD 1 of the Act.  The principles set out by the judge for determining whether a payment is a gift will be applicable in future cases.

### Facts

The judgment addresses two proceedings, which were heard together, both involving the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") as defendant.  The plaintiff in the first proceeding is the Trust. The plaintiff in the second proceeding is Mr Coward, a New Zealand tax resident and member of the Church, whose daughter was a missionary.

The Church itself is based in Salt Lake City, Utah, but has a worldwide presence, including in New Zealand. Under the Church's missionary programme, young members can apply to take part in an 18 – 24 month mission service overseas. As part of their application, a missionary is expected to commit to raising a "standard amount" to go towards supporting the Church's missionary work. This "standard amount" is not paid towards their mission overseas, but rather towards funding the expenses of other missionaries in New Zealand. The missionaries sent overseas from New Zealand have their expenses paid by the relevant Church-related entity in the country where their mission takes place.

At the time of Mr Coward's daughter's application, the "standard amount" for New Zealand was $475 per month or $5,700 per annum. At issue in Mr Coward's tax challenge were his contributions directed towards this annual amount.

### Decision

The plaintiffs argued that the payments were gifts because they were gratuitous payments made by Church members to the Trust to support the Church's charitable work and were, therefore, dispositions of property without consideration.

 The Commissioner argued that the payments were made to meet the essential personal expenses of the specific missionary while on a mission and not gratuitously made to the Trust.  As such, the payments were not gifts.

_What is a "gift"?_

After having considered relevant cases from Australia, Canada, United States, and New Zealand, Hinton J adopted the following principles for determining whether a payment qualifies as a "gift":

1.  For there to be a gift, there must be a voluntary transfer of property owned by the donor to the donee.
2.  There can be no material benefit flowing to the donor as a result of the donation.
3.  However, a minor benefit or consideration will likely not be sufficient to vitiate the gift.  Neither will a "purely moral" benefit.

In examining whether the donor receives a benefit, the following considerations are relevant:

1.  The benefit to the donor need not arise as a result of meeting a legal obligation.
2.  Anticipation of a benefit may be sufficient to deny a gift.
3.  There must be a connection or link between the donor's payment and the benefit.

The donor does not have to directly benefit from the donation, it is enough that the benefit is indirect, albeit it must be more than a pure moral benefit. For example, there will be a material benefit for a parent or grandparent in ensuring one's children are educated, or if one receives a contractual right to insist on the donee's performance, as a result of the payment.

_Benefit or consideration to the donor_

Hinton J considered that the payments were all voluntary and, as such, the case turned on whether there was any resulting benefit or consideration to the different categories of donor.  To determine whether there was any benefit or consideration, Hinton J asked: 

1.  Was there a sufficient link between the standard payments and the payment of a missionary's essential expenses?
2.  If so, was there a benefit to the different categories of donor as a result of the payment of those expenses?

_There was a sufficient link_

Hinton J considered that there was a clear link between the payments made as part of the application to be a missionary, and receipt by the missionary from the Church overseas of their essential expenses. Donors knew and anticipated that their payments to the Trust would enable the missionary (on behalf of whom they were paying) to go on their mission, and correspondingly to have their expenses paid by the Church. 

_Was there material benefit to each category of donor?_

While Hinton J accepted that the missionary work is rigorous and conducted in very restricted conditions and circumstances, she accepted the Commissioner's argument that Ms Coward, and any other individual missionary, benefited from having their essential expenses paid.

As such, the Judge held that payments by a missionary to the Trust were not "gifts" under s LD 1.

Hinton J then considered whether payments made to the Trust by a parent (such as the payments made by Mr Coward for his daughter's application) or a grandparent were "gifts" under s LD 1. She held that because such payments provide a benefit to the child, they will generally also benefit the parent and grandparent donors who benefit by seeing their child engage in life education, being able to travel, live overseas, and experience being a missionary abroad.

As such, the Judge held that payments by parents and grandparents to the Trust were not "gifts" under s LD 1.

Hinton J considered, however, that payments made to the Trust by other relatives (including siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, and more distant relations), as well as friends of the missionary and other members of the Church, fell into the category of pure generosity and were therefore gifts. This was because these other relatives and friends do not generally feel the same sense of obligation to assist a missionary applicant or to ensure their needs are met, and any benefit to these people is minor or immaterial and is a "pure moral benefit". 

_Summary of result_

Hinton J held that the payments to the Trust in support of a missionary's application to participate in an overseas mission service, by the following classes of people, were not gifts under s LD 1 and, as such, the Trust was not permitted to issue donation receipts in respect of them and Mr Coward was not entitled to tax credits:

1.  missionaries called to serve the Church;
2.  a parent or legal guardian of a missionary; and
3.  a grandparent of a missionary.

However, such payments made by the following classes of people did qualify as gifts and, as such, the Trust was permitted to issue donation receipts in respect of them:

1.  a sibling of a missionary;
2.  a more distant relative of a missionary, such as a cousin, uncle or aunt; and
3.  a Church member unrelated to the missionary, such as a friend of a missionary or a member from the missionary's local ward.

High Court confirms a lease surrender payment is a revenue receipt in the hands of the landlord
===============================================================================================

2017 case note - High Court confirms a lease surrender payment is a revenue receipt in the hands of the landlord – capital, unacceptable tax position.

Case

Easy Park Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 1893

Legislative References

Section CB(1) Income Tax Act 2007, Section 141B Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer is a commercial landlord and received a lump sum payment from one of its tenants for early termination of a lease. The Court held that where the taxpayer is in the business of leasing property the lease surrender payment was received by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business and was therefore a revenue receipt subject to tax. However, as the case was not clear cut, a shortfall penalty was not appropriate.

### Impact

The judgment provides assistance in distinguishing between capital and revenue receipts. However, in the case of lease surrender payments, the impact is limited as the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”) has been amended to make it clear that lease surrender payments are income in the hands of the recipient (see s CC 1C of the ITA effective from 1 April 2013).

### Facts

Easy Park Limited (“the taxpayer”) purchased the four storey Whitcoulls building at 312 Lambton Quay on 28 June 2003. At the time of purchase the building was subject to a 12 year lease by the anchor tenant Whitcoulls Group Limited of levels 1, 1A and 2 of the building. Levels 3 and 4 of the building were later leased to Lifestyle Gym.

When the building was purchased there were no identified earthquake concerns. However, a new earthquake building code was introduced in 2004. In 2007 the Wellington City Council advised the taxpayer that its initial evaluation had placed the building at 11% of the new building standards. The taxpayer commissioned a report which provided that the Whitcoulls building met 16% of the new building standard. Consequently, in 2010 the Wellington City Council issued a notice requiring the taxpayer to strengthen or demolish the Whitcoulls building by 2025.

Whitcoulls Group Limited went into voluntary administration in February 2011. The business was sold to Whitcoulls 2011 Limited (“W2011 Ltd”) in May 2011 and the lease was assigned to the new owners. W2011 Ltd announced publicly that it intended to move to the nearby premises at 226 Lambton Quay.

In June 2011, W2011 Ltd and the taxpayer agreed to surrender the lease and a deed of surrender of lease was signed in February 2012. W2011 Ltd agreed to pay the taxpayer $1.1 million for the early termination of the lease (about a third of the rent remaining).

Bayleys’ commercial leasing team advised the taxpayer that it would need to undertake the required strengthening work in order to attract a quality tenant. While the extent of the remedial work was assessed, the taxpayer agreed in principle to lease levels 1, 1A and 2 to Hallenstein Glassons Limited. An agreement to lease was signed on 5 December 2012 with an annual rent of $1.1 million. As part of the agreement the taxpayer was required to undertake the strengthening work to at least 85% of the new build standard, and was to use its best endeavours to obtain at least 95%.

In February 2013, a deed of surrender of lease was signed with Lifestyle Gym in order to obtain vacant possession and complete the strengthening work. Once the strengthening work was completed Glassons opened its new flagship store on levels 1, 1A and 2 of the building in October 2013. Level 4 was eventually leased to Harrison Grierson in 2014. Level 3 remained vacant.

When the taxpayer filed its tax return for the 2012 income year, it treated the lease surrender payment as a capital receipt (and therefore not subject to income tax) and provided a covering letter drawing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) attention to the treatment of the payment. The Commissioner assessed the payment as income and applied a shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position.

### Decision

The Court canvassed the general principles relating to the distinction between capital and revenue payments and receipts. The Court noted that there is no New Zealand decision in which it has been held that a lease surrender payment received by a landlord is a capital receipt but did look at the relevant cases touching on lease surrender payments. However, the Court noted that these were primarily from the perspective of the payer/lessee rather than the recipient/landlord. Further, the Court considered it clear from the authorities that a payment made to induce a lessee to enter into a lease of premises from which to conduct their business will, in the hands of the lessee, be capital as the payments are made with a view to bringing into existence an asset for an enduring benefit.

The Court rejected the five key points advanced by the taxpayer supporting an argument that the principles relating to the lessee should also apply to the landlord. The Court also rejected the argument that the Court of Appeal decision of _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McKenzies (NZ) Ltd_ 2 NZLR 736 (CA), supported the proposition that the “identifiable asset” approach means leases must generally be regarded as fixed capital in the hands of both the lessee and lessor.

The Court held that it was not correct to say that the “identifiable asset” test will always be regarded for income tax purposes as capital, regardless of the nature of the taxpayer’s business. What is required is an examination of what the relevant transaction and the receipt was calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view in the specific case at hand. That requires examination of the nature of the asset viewed in the context of the taxpayer’s particular business.

In this case the Court accepted that the asset was the lease and that in the hands of W2011 Ltd, it was a capital asset. However, the Court was unable to accept that the lease was a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. The lease did not form part of the taxpayer’s underlying business structure and it was not only indirectly connected with producing revenue. Rather, the lease was the very mechanism which generated profit for the taxpayer and was the taxpayer’s core business.

The Court did not consider that the lease was so fundamental and permanent to the taxpayer’s business that its surrender affected the structure of the taxpayer’s business. The revenue producing asset was the leasehold which could be, and was, made the subject of another lease. Further, the nature of the lease surrender payment in the hands of the taxpayer was not affected by the need to undertake earthquake strengthening work, or the fact that the subsequent lease was on less favourable terms.

#### Shortfall penalty

The test for determining whether the tax position taken by the taxpayer is an unacceptable tax position for the purposes of s 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is an objective one. The Court held that there was no authority which squarely determined the position against that taken by the taxpayer. Further, public rulings are not binding on taxpayers and in any event the fact that there was a public ruling on the matter arguably suggests that its subject matter may be difficult or controversial. The Court held that the capital/revenue divide is notoriously oblique and it is conceivable that circumstances could yet arise where a lease surrender payment might properly be regarded as capital in the hands of the lessor. Accordingly, on balance no shortfall penalty should be imposed.

High Court confirms amounts dealt with on property consultant’s behalf attributable as income
=============================================================================================

Ethnik Krasniqi (“Mr Krasniqi”) had not filed any returns for the 2005 to 2011 income years.

Case

Krasniqi v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2075

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 89A, 138G; Income Tax Act 2007 ss BD 3, CA 1, (CB 6, CB 7)

### Summary

Ethnik Krasniqi (“Mr Krasniqi”) had not filed any returns for the 2005 to 2011 income years. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) conducted an investigation which revealed Mr Krasniqi had undertaken consultancy work in New Zealand during this period. Substantial payments had been made from entities which Mr Krasniqi had worked for to his family members and third parties in Australia, where Mr Krasniqi’s family was based. Mr Krasniqi also had access to an eftpos card connected to one of these entities and he used that card to cover personal expenses. The investigation also revealed Mr Krasniqi was the primary beneficiary of a family trust. The Commissioner issued default assessments in respect of payments she considered had been received by Mr Krasniqi or paid or dealt with on Mr Krasniqi’s behalf or in his interest. The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) upheld the majority of the Commissioner’s assessments. Mr Krasniqi appealed the High Court and the Commissioner cross-appealed. The matter was heard before Wylie J in the High Court. His Honour dismissed both Mr Krasniqi’s appeal and the Commissioner’s cross appeal.

### Impact

The decision confirms that income amounts can be attributable to a non-party to a particular transaction pursuant to s BD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”), where there is a genuine case for suggesting that the amounts have been dealt with on the person’s behalf or in his or her interest.

The judgment confirms that in attribution cases the onus and standard of proof remains unaffected and the Commissioner has no duty to undertake particular enquiries on behalf of the taxpayer. This is so even when the documents relating to the transaction underpinning the assessment are not in the taxpayer’s immediate possession but held by the parties directly involved in the transaction.

Note should be taken of the Judge’s expressed view that costs should lie where they fall as a result of the Commissioner being unsuccessful in her cross-appeal. In considering whether to cross-appeal in future cases, the possibility of not being awarded costs should be taken into account.

### Facts

Mr Krasniqi is a New Zealand citizen and tax resident, who was involved in property trading and land development as a consultant during the disputed period (being the 2005-2011 income years). He primarily provided his consultancy services in connection with the business dealings of his father and two childhood friends “Mr Brown” and “Mr Smith” (“associates”). The Commissioner assessed deposits and expenditure of trusts and other entities of his associates as income to Mr Krasniqi because she considered he received them in exchange for consultancy services provided. Other deposits from unknown sources into Mr Krasniqi’s personal bank account and the bank account of a related trust “the Krasniqi Discretionary Trust” have also been assessed as income to Mr Krasniqi.

The Commissioner was largely successful in the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”), but certain isolated amounts which had either been paid by Mr Brown to an outfit in Thailand or which had not originated from entities controlled by his associates had been found not assessable as income to Mr Krasniqi under ordinary concepts.

Mr Krasniqi appealed to the High Court in respect of certain (but not all) of the payments which had been found attributable as income to him and the Commissioner cross-appealed in respect of all of the amounts which the TRA found not assessable.

### Decision

_Section 138G(2) Application_

The High Court confirmed the TRA’s decision not to allow new issues, which had not been included in the Mr Krasniqi’s Statement of Position (“SOP”), to be raised.

Wylie J noted that the Commissioner had provided substantial information to Mr Krasniqi and his solicitor throughout the disputes process and had reasonably informed Mr Krasniqi of certain documents in the Commissioner’s position which it was expected that Mr Krasniqi could source for himself. Mr Krasniqi had been given lists of documentary evidence held by the Commissioner, but had not requested copies of those and had not taken up the opportunity to attend a facilitated conference when offered to him, instead sending his legal advisor. Mr Krasniqi himself had not been forthcoming in providing documents despite promises being made to this effect.

In the circumstances, Mr Krasniqi’s argument that it was not until after discovery had been provided that he had been able to understand the basis for the Commissioner’s assessments was not accepted.

_Mr Krasniqi’s Appeal_

Wylie J dismissed Mr Krasniqi’s appeal on all points, noting that Mr Krasniqi had failed to discharge the onus of proof and had not provided any corroborating documentation or witness statements to support his various explanations.

With respect to the $1,309,185.04 worth of deposits into the Krasniqi Discretionary Trust, his Honour found that the TRA had correctly found the amount assessable to Mr Krasniqi on the basis of the evidence that he was the primary beneficiary of the trust and had some (albeit limited) authority with respect to the trust’s bank account. The Court further noted that there was a correlation between the use of Mr Krasniqi’s personal account and the use of the trust account with eftpos transactions on the same dates and places and transfers between the accounts.

With respect to the $105,000 payment by Mr Brown’s entity to an outfit called “Roverland”, Wylie J noted that there were several avenues open to Mr Krasniqi for corroborating his blanket denial that this vehicle was not purchased for his personal use. For example, he could have called Mr Brown or other business associates or personal friends to give evidence about his usual mode of transport while in New Zealand. Accordingly, Mr Krasniqi had failed to discharge the onus on this issue also.

More finely balanced was the $100,025 international payment from Mr Brown’s entity which contained a reference to Mr Krasniqi’s brother, Flamur Kransiqi. The Court noted that while there was a reference to Flamur Krasniqi on the payment reference, the payment was not itemised in Flamur Krasniqi’s Australian bank statements in the same way as other payments from Mr Brown’s entities had been. Again, the onus being on Mr Krasniqi, who had not called any witnesses or produced any documents to show this payment was not his, the High Court found that the TRA had correctly found the amount assessable as his income.

Finally the Court also dismissed Mr Krasniqi’s appeal in respect of certain payments which Mr Krasniqi argued were related to the acquisition and subsequent sale of a residential property in Remuera which he claimed he had used as his private home. Mr Krasniqi had originally put forward both in his Notice of Proposed Adjustment and his SOP that he did not have a permanent place of abode available to him and thus was not a tax resident (an argument abandoned early in the proceeding as Mr Krasniqi was clearly caught by the day count test). Wylie J noted that Mr Krasniqi’s recent claim that the amounts related to the acquisition and sale of his private home was not only uncorroborated, but “conflicting, unconvincing and totally self-serving”.

_The Commissioner’s Cross Appeal_

The High Court agreed with the TRA’s finding that one deposit for AUD $519,351.45 from Sun Marine Services into Mr Krasniqi’s Australian bank account was not assessable as income to Mr Krasniqi because it was not a payment from any of Mr Krasniqi’s associates, but from an unrelated third-party entity and was likely the sale of a boat which would not ordinarily be taxable and thus not income under ordinary concepts. On the same basis, two deposits totalling $66,300 from the same entity into the Krasniqi Discretionary Trust were also found not assessable.

Two further transactions of $10,020 and $12,020 from Mr Brown’s entities to an entity in Phuket were also found not to be income attributable to Mr Krasniqi because Mr Krasniqi could not be connected to the payments in Thailand.

High Court confirms deductions for bad debts not available as operating a “Benevolence on the Conscience Loan Fund” not a money lending business
================================================================================================================================================

Unsuccessful taxpayer appeal of a decision in the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”).

Case

Boon Gunn Hong v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 2539

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007 ss DA 1, DB 31(1), DB31(3); Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 15B, 141A; Insolvency Act 2006 s 304

### Summary

Unsuccessful taxpayer appeal of a decision in the Taxation Review Authority (“the TRA”). The High Court confirmed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) assessments disallowing two deductions for bad debts under s DB 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the ITA”) and imposing shortfall penalties under s 141A for not taking reasonable care. The appellant was found not to carry on a business of holding financial arrangements, nor had he discharged the onus of proving that he wrote the debts off as bad in the 2011 income year.

### Impact

This is the first High Court authority on the application of s DB 31 of the ITA (or its predecessors) in 23 years, the latest being _Budget Rent a Car Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263. It is also the first time the High Court considers subsection DB 31(1)(a)(ii) of the ITA which was inserted in the legislation on 27 February 2014 with retrospective effect to debts that go bad on or after 1 April 2008.

The High Court approached s DB 31 consistent with previous TRA decisions and applied settled legal principles (including the business test as laid down in _Grieve v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 101). For the most part, the case turned on its facts.

### Facts

In a decision dated 29 March 2018, the TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessments disallowing two deductions claimed in the appellant’s 2011 income tax return for bad debts in the amount of $50,000 and $122,280 respectively and imposing shortfall penalties under s 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) on the basis the appellant had not taken reasonable care (“the TRA’s Decision”). The loans were advanced in 2006 to two clients of the appellant’s legal practice out of a fund which the appellant had created for this purpose in 2005 and which he called his “Benevolence on the Conscience Loan Fund”. The clients were facing financial difficulties.

On appeal, the High Court upheld the TRA’s Decision.

### Decision

The High Court found the appellant had not shown, according to his own accounting procedures, that the loans had been written off in the 2011 income year. Jagose J noted that except for the appellant’s own assertion there was no evidence that his office administrator, Ms Chan, had entered the write-offs in the spreadsheet during the 2011 income year. Ms Chan’s absence as a witness was unexplained. An inference was therefore available that what she may have said in evidence would not have assisted the appellant.

The High Court further found that the debtors (both being natural persons) had not been released at law from making further payments as they had not been discharged from bankruptcy under s 304 of the Insolvency Act 2006 at the time the deductions were claimed. Section DB 31(1)(a)(ii) of the ITA was therefore not applicable.

His Honour applied the business test in _Grieve_ and held that the appellant was not carrying on, even in part, a lending business for the purpose of deriving assessible income. The appellant’s only hope of financial return was if grateful clients elected to reimburse him. The lending was a side project which was not carried on in an organised and coherent manner, or with sufficient continuity and extent to constitute a business.

There was also an insufficient connection between the appellant’s legal services business and the financial arrangements for which deductions were sought. Jagose J noted the two do not easily or naturally co-exist as lending money to clients raises significant issues under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008.

The High Court upheld TRA’s findings that the appellant failed to take reasonable care on the basis that a reasonable person in the appellant’s circumstances would have: (a) taken sufficient steps to understand relevant taxpayer obligations; (b) kept adequate books and records in regards to the Claimed Loans and the reasons for assessing the debts had gone bad; and (c) filed returns and paid tax on time.

High Court confirms tax avoidance and opening of time bar on basis of returns being wilfully misleading
=======================================================================================================

2016 case note - High Court confirms tax avoidance and opening of time bar on basis of returns being wilfully misleading - Abusive Tax Shortfall Penalty.

Case

Great North Motor Company Limited (In Receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993; Income Tax Act 2007; Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Great North Motor Company Limited (“Great North”) commenced challenge proceedings against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“Commissioner”) in respect of the Commissioner’s assessments in the income tax periods 31 March 1996 to 2011. The High Court upheld the Commissioner’s assessments.

### Facts

Great North was incorporated on 21 October 1959 and until 7 February 1992 was called Zupps Motors Ltd. It operated a used car yard. 99.99 percent of the plaintiff’s shares are held by Glen Eden Holdings Ltd (“Glen Eden”). Glen Eden is wholly owned by Commercial Management Ltd (“Commercial Management”). Commercial Management is wholly owned by Commercial Administration Ltd (“Commercial Administration”) and Commercial Administration is wholly owned by Glen Eden. The remaining 0.01 percent of Great North is owned by Downsview Nominees Ltd (“Downsview”) and Downsview is wholly owned by Commercial Administration. The Court noted that Great North’s ownership “may be fairly described as circular”.

Mr John George Russell was the sole director of Glen Eden, Commercial Management and Commercial Administration as well as accountant and secretary to all three companies.

Mr Radisich and his companies are longstanding clients of Mr Russell and Mr Radisich is a former shareholder of Great North (he held 98.4 percent of the shares until September 1998). All shares in Great North are held on trust for Mr Radisich’s benefit.

On 20 August 1993, Great North issued a debenture to Glen Eden in return for Glen Eden advancing $380,277 to Great North. This sum was repayable “on demand”; meaning Great North was liable to repay the advance in full at any time. Interest was payable at any rate specified by Glen Eden, but only when Glen Eden actually demanded payment of interest. In the absence of Glen Eden stipulating an interest rate, the default rate was 28 percent per annum. Under the debenture, Great North was entitled to make repayments of principal at any time. At that time, Great North was insolvent. It had ceased trading on 10 December 1993, some four months after Glen Eden had injected the funding. The Court considered it likely however that these funds were used to repay a creditor (Ron West Ltd, of which 99.99 per cent of the shares were owned by Mr Radisich and the remaining 0.01 percent by Downsview).

On 14 July 1994, Mr Russell wrote to the Commissioner saying Great North had no assets or income and thus no funds to pay PAYE tax deductions from 31 March 1991. Mr Russell corresponded similarly on 21 March 1995. Great North was placed in liquidation, in the intervening period, on 1 September 1994.

On 20 April and 28 June 1995, Mr Russell filed income tax returns for Great North for that year. The returns asserted that Great North had made combined losses of $1,785,076.12. Great North was removed from the companies register on 8 May 1996. However, it was restored to the register on 1 July 1997 on application by Glen Eden and Mr Russell.

On 23 December 1997 Mr Russell wrote two letters to the Commissioner outlining objections to the Commissioner’s 1991 to 1995 determinations. In April 1998, Great North instituted judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner in relation to these determinations. However, Great North did not recommence business and was again placed in liquidation on 24 June 1998. Glen Eden (the shareholder) abandoned its judicial review proceedings in September 1998.

On 25 May 2005 Kensington Developments Ltd (“KDL”) acquired 14 debentures from Glen Eden, including that issued by Great North to Glen Eden in 1993.

KDL was incorporated in 1979 but has been in receivership since 30 June 1994. Mr Russell has been its receiver from July 1994 and sole director from 1 April 2008. The Court considered it was unlikely KDL paid anything to acquire the debentures yet Great North now owed KDL (by virtue of the transfer) $5.9 million under the debenture. On 26 May 2005, Mr Russell appointed himself receiver of Great North. On 29 May 2005, Great North was struck off the companies register.

In July 2005 Mr Russell filed tax returns on behalf of Great North even though the company had been removed from the register two months earlier. The returns were for the tax years ending 31 March 1996 to 31 March 2005 inclusive and claimed expenditure and associated losses made up of the interest payable on Great North’s debenture since inception (which by 2005 had reached $7,206,855.66).

On 13 July 2006 Mr Russell filed Great North’s return for that year (with losses of $8,875,561.97). Computer generated determinations were automatically issued allowing the claimed expenditure and losses. From 11 October 2005, the Commissioner issued re-assessments disallowing the expenditure and losses.

The Court considered it “almost certain” that Mr Russell had anticipated the Commissioner’s re-assessments as:

1.  On 27 August 2010 Mr Russell and Glen Eden applied to reinstate Great North to the companies register, and it was reinstated from 8 October 2010;
2.  On 5 January 2011 Mr Russell filed tax returns for 2007–2009; and
3.  On 10 January 2011 in response to a letter from the Commissioner, Mr Russell informed the Commissioner that her re-assessments were time-barred because of the operation of s 330 of the Companies Act 1993.

Over 2011 and 2012 Mr Russell filed Great North’s tax returns for the 2010–2011 years. On 7 April 2011, the Commissioner commenced an investigation into Great North’s returns and sought information from Mr Russell. The parties continued corresponding into 2012.

On 4 September 2012 KDL transferred (at least some of) its interest in the debenture to Timberton Investment Ltd (“Timberton”). Timberton is wholly owned by Mr Radisich. Mr Russell signed the deed of assignment as receivers for both Great North and KDL. Timberton paid KDL a total of $600,000 (albeit the Court noted that Mr Russell had accepted this was paid to use up Great North’s tax losses). Great North agreed to pay contributory interest as necessary at a rate of 10 percent per annum. Timberton acquired Great North’s tax losses at a rate of 15 cents per dollar of loss.

In 2014, the Commissioner concluded that Great North had engaged in tax avoidance and s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) permitted re-assessments to be made.

### Decision

Before considering each issue in turn, the Court firstly noted that Mr Russell’s evidence was unpersuasive.

_**Tax avoidance**_

The Court confirmed that the specific provisions were satisfied but found that the arrangement was a tax avoidance arrangement.

The Court considered that Great North had issued debentures to Glen Eden when it knew it was insolvent, the debenture terms reinforced the artificiality of the arrangement and the debenture was later transferred to KDL without consideration. The Court noted that the ownership of the relevant entities was circular and there was no genuine economic consequence for Great North or KDL or even Timberton.

The Court considered that the arrangement was artificial and contrived with creditors being replaced to alter the incidence of tax. The Court concluded that Parliament would not have contemplated the deduction of interest as a business-related expense in this way.

_**Time bar: s 108 of the TAA**_

The Court concluded that for the purposes of s 108(2) of the TAA, Mr Russell knew the returns he completed and filed on behalf of Great North were misleading on the basis that, either, he had actual knowledge the arrangement constituted tax avoidance or that it was highly likely tax avoidance (and therefore subjectively reckless).

_**Shortfall penalty**_

The Court found that the tax position taken by Great North was unacceptable and abusive and was therefore satisfied that the Commissioner did not err in imposing shortfall penalties for an abusive tax position.

_**Time bar: s 330 of the Companies Act 1993**_

The Court considered that it is clear from s 15 of the Companies Act 1993 that once removed from the register a company does not exist in law. However, the Court accepted that s 330 of the Companies Act 1993 (as demonstrated by the relevant case law) provides that the actions of a deregistered company are not treated as nullities upon the company’s restoration to the register. Accordingly a return can be retrospectively validated.

However, the Court considered that validation does not backdate the return to the time of filing:

1.  Until restoration there is no taxpayer with whom the Commissioner can deal and therefore until restored, the deregistered company cannot defend itself by complying with the applicable statutory time period;
2.  Sections 328(6) and 329(4) of the Companies Act 1993 seek to ensure that neither the restored company nor any other person is unfairly affected by the company’s removal from the register and that s 330 should be read alongside those powers; and
3.  Section 108 strikes a balance between the finality of taxpayer affairs and the effective maintenance of the tax base and “unbridled retrospective validation” of a tax return under s 330 of the Companies Act 1993 could imperil s 108 of the TAA. The Court said that, if it was a live issue, it would have concluded that the time bar commenced only when Great North was restored to the register on 8 October 2010.

High Court confirms that judicial review is discretionary and it is inappropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion to grant relief where it could serve no purpose or have practical effect
===================================================================================================================================================================================================

Brian Cyril Rowell (“Mr Rowell”) judicially reviewed Zohrab’s J decision to decline to recuse himself from hearing Mr Rowell’s criminal charges.

Case

Brian Cyril Rowell v District Court at Blenheim and Attorney General \[2018\] NZHC 1863

Legislative References

Judicial Review Procedure Act 2016; Tax Administration Act 1994 s 92B; Criminal Procedure Act

### Summary

Brian Cyril Rowell (“Mr Rowell”) judicially reviewed Zohrab’s J decision to decline to recuse himself from hearing Mr Rowell’s criminal charges. The basis for the judicial review was that Zohrab J showed bias in favour of the Prosecutor against Mr Rowell when he “provided a privately-distributed minute” to the prosecutor to use in New Zealand Law Society complaint proceedings. The Attorney-General opposed the application on the basis that Mr Rowell did not establish actual or apparent bias and that the judicial review was moot. There would be no practical effect of granting relief in this case as the charges against Mr Rowell have been transferred to the Wellington District Court and Zohrab J will not preside over any further proceedings involving Mr Rowell.

The Court found for the Attorney-General and the judicial review application was dismissed.

### Impact

This Judgment confirms that it is procedurally wrong to have information placed before a decision-maker, without the information being disclosed to all parties. However, where it was a genuine mistake and not with intent to secretly keep information from the defendant, it does not give rise to an appearance of bias of the Judge.

The Judgment also confirms that relief in judicial review proceedings is discretionary and it is inappropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion to grant relief where it could serve no useful purpose or have practical effect.

### Facts

Mr Rowell is facing 31 criminal charges (to be heard in the Wellington District Court) of aiding and abetting his companies to provide false Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns. His application to have the charges dismissed was heard and dismissed by Zohrab J in the Blenheim District Court on 10 February 2016.

During the hearing Mr Rowell became aware the prosecution’s summary of facts had been given to Zohrab J at his request prior to the hearing. While Mr Rowell received a copy of the summary of facts, he was unaware Zohrab J received a copy.

On 15 April 2016, Mr Rowell complained to the New Zealand Law Society that the prosecutor had not told him that the summary of facts was handed up to Zohrab J.

On 6 May 2016, Zohrab J issued a minute in which he explained how the Court came to be in possession of the summary of facts.

Due to an error by a Deputy Registrar, the minute was not sent to Mr Rowell. The minute was sent to the prosecutor and used by the prosecutor in the defence of the Mr Rowell’s complaint to the Law Society.

Mr Rowell then applied for Zohrab J to recuse himself on the ground of bias, which was declined on 28 June 2016.

On 10 August 2017, Mr Rowell’s criminal trial was transferred from Blenheim District to the Wellington District court by consent.

On 13 December 2017, Mr Rowell applied for judicial review seeking to have the 28 June 2016 decision quashed.

### Decision

_Issue 1: Was there actual or apparent bias?_

The Court noted and applied the relevant principles for recusal that were settled by the Supreme Court in _Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Co Ltd_ \[2009\] NZSC 72, \[2010\] 1 NZLR 35 (at \[3\]–\[4\], \[20\], \[81\] and \[86\]; recalled on the merits by _Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Co Ltd_ (No 2) \[2009\] NZSC 122, \[2010\] 1 NZLR 76 at \[4\]). A Judge should recuse himself or herself on the basis of apparent bias if a fair-minded and properly-informed lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question which the Judge is to decide. This involves two stages:

1.  First, the Judge must identify the circumstances that may lead the Judge to decide a case other than on its merits.
2.  Second, the party alleging apparent bias must also articulate a logical connection between the matter complained of and the feared deviation from impartiality.

The Court identified two key issues relating to the issuing of Zohrab J’s minute.

1.  The first issue was whether the issuing of the minute demonstrated actual or apparent bias on the part of Zohrab J. In the Courts view, the minute Zohrab J issued simply explains in an objective a way that he was responsible for requesting the summary of facts before the February hearing. Accordingly, there was no actual or apparent bias as there was no nexus or logical connection between Zohrab J issuing his minute and there being a possibility he was biased.
2.  The second issued relates to the minute not being provided to both parties. In the Court’s view this was clearly a procedural error and while this reflected poorly on Court administration, it occurred because of a genuine mistake or oversight which does not give rise to an appearance of bias on the part of Zohrab J. The Court also held that there was no actual or apparent bias in this.

_Issue 2: Was the application moot and should relief be awarded?_

The Court applied the principle confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Unison Networks Ltd v Commerce Commission_ CA284/05, 19 December 2006 at \[83\] that relief in judicial review is discretionary and it is inappropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion to grant relief where it could serve no purpose or have practical effect.

To this end the Court accepted the Attorney-General’s submission that the application is moot and there would be no practical effect of granting relief in this case. The charges against Mr Rowell had been transferred to the Wellington District Court and Zohrab J was not going to preside over any further proceedings involving Mr Rowell. There was accordingly no need for Zohrab J to recuse himself and even if he did, it would have no effect.

High Court confirms the use of the Mannix Rule
==============================================

The Commissioner opposed Emborion’s applications. In the High Court, van Bohemen J dismissed all of Emborion’s applications.

Case

Emborion International Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2018\] NZHC 178

Legislative References

High Court Rules 2016; New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990; Interpretation Act 1999

### Summary

Emborion International Ltd (“Emborion”) applied to the High Court seeking orders regarding representation during the conduct of the proceeding and substantive hearing, that this matter be heard on the papers and that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) meet all of Emborion’s legal fees and court costs. The Commissioner opposed Emborion’s applications. In the High Court, van Bohemen J dismissed all of Emborion’s applications.

### Impact

The decision confirms the application of the decision in _Re G J Mannix_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 309 (“_Re G J Mannix_”).

### Facts

Emborion has challenged the Commissioner’s assessment in the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”).

On 1 November 2016, Moore J granted the Commissioner’s application to transfer the matter to the High Court on the grounds, inter alia, that the proceedings are moderately complex, that they involve a tax arrangement orchestrated by John George Russell, and that three other proceedings involving similar issues with companies associated with Mr Russell have been transferred from the TRA to the High Court. By Minute dated 12 April 2017, Moore J refused Emborion’s subsequent application to recall his decision to transfer the dispute to the High Court.

On 31 January 2018, Emborion lodged an application signed by Glenda Frances Rogers (Emborion’s sole director) seeking orders that the dispute be heard on the papers and that the Commissioner meet all of Emborion’s legal fees and court costs, alongside a memorandum for the case management conference also signed by Mrs Rogers, which set out the issues involved in the dispute and proposed a timetable for the proceeding.

On 2 February 2018, the Commissioner filed a memorandum in response, stating that whether Mrs Rogers has standing to file documents on behalf of Emborion. Further, the Commissioner opposed Emborion’s application to have the dispute heard on the papers but largely agreed with the issues identified and the timetabling proposed.

On 13 February 2018, the Commissioner filed a further Notice of Opposition to Emborion’s application that the dispute be heard on the papers and that the Commissioner pay Emborion’s legal fees and court costs.

### Decision

_Representation of Emborion_

The Court could see no reason to depart from the decision in _Re G J Mannix_, namely that a company must be represented by a barrister or solicitor and the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and Interpretation Act 1999 do not make companies into natural persons. Accordingly the Court confirmed that Emborion may not be represented in this proceeding except by a barrister or solicitor.

Regarding Mrs Roger’s standing to file documents in the proceeding, the Court was prepared to grant Emborion some latitude as the agreed timetable requires some action in the coming weeks. Regardless, the Court stated that if Emborion intends to pursue its challenge, it should obtain professional legal advice as soon as possible.

Lastly, the Court made it very clear that even though Mr Russell’s participation in this conference was not objected to, if Mr Russell should attend any future conferences, he will not be able to address the Court on behalf of the company.

_Emborion's application for the proceeding to be determined on the papers_

The Court dismissed Emborion’s application to have the matter determined on the papers. First, the Court found that the high level of disagreement of the points at issue between the Commissioner and Emborion would make it a difficult matter for a judge to determine on the papers. Secondly, as it was proposed that the hearing would take five days and the Commissioner will likely wish to cross examine Mr Russell, it would again make it difficult to be satisfactorily determined on the papers.

Additionally, the Court also dismissed Emborion’s application to have its legal fees and court costs met by the Commissioner. Costs will only be determined once the outcome of a matter is known.

_Schedule 5 of the High Court Rules_

The Court noted that the parties are largely in agreement on the matters to be considered under Schedule 5 of the High Court Rules. A timetable was accordingly set down for the matter.

High Court considers a right to use land in context of depreciable intangible property
======================================================================================

2016 case note - High Court considers a right to use land in the context of depreciable intangible property.

Case

ANZCO Foods Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1015

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This case concerned an interest obtained under a settlement deed which amended an encumbrance over the taxpayer's land. The High Court rejected the taxpayer's argument that this interest was a right to use land pursuant to sch 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("ITA") and was deductible as depreciable intangible property.    

### Impact

The decision is useful guidance in considering whether a deduction can be allowed in respect of depreciable intangible property. Although the case only concerns a "right to use land" as listed in sch 14, the principles are applicable to depreciable intangible property generally.

### Facts

This is a tax challenge by ANZCO Foods Limited ("ANZCO"), seeking to challenge assessments by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") disallowing deductions claimed for depreciation. The deductions were based on a payment to allow ANZCO to undertake meat processing and freezing activities at a plant previously owned by a rival meat processing company, AFFCO New Zealand Limited ("AFFCO").

The payment arose from a negotiated settlement to vary an encumbrance on land purchased by ANZCO. This encumbrance restricted ANZCO from using the land to slaughter, freeze, cool, and further process meat products. ANZCO treated the result of settlement with AFFCO as conferring upon it a right to use land and sought to depreciate that item under the ITA.

AFFCO closed and sold off a number of its properties during the 1990s. One of the properties, a meat processing plant located in Waitara, was sold to a third party and included an encumbrance/limitation in the sale and purchase agreement.

This encumbrance stated that the purchaser will not use the property for "slaughtering, processing, cooling or freezing of lamb, sheep, Bobby calves, cattle or goats for a period of twenty (20) years from the possession date". The sale and purchase agreement required the third party purchaser to secure the performance of this covenant by the purchaser and its successors in title.

ANZCO purchased the Waitara property from the third party in February 2004.  ANZCO did not consider that its activities at the plant were caught under the encumbrance. AFFCO disagreed and issued proceedings seeking an injunction to prevent the land being used for the purpose of processing or manufacturing meat products. 

AFFCO was successful in their proceedings in the High Court (_AFFCO New Zealand Ltd v ANZCO Foods Waitara Ltd_ HC Wellington CIV-2004-985-499, 23 August 2004) and partially successful in the Court of Appeal (_ANZCO Foods Waitara Ltd v AFFCO New Zealand Ltd_ \[2006\] 3 NZLR 351 (CA)). ANZCO applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court; however, a settlement was reached in July 2005 whereby ANZCO agreed to pay $5,600,000 plus GST to use the property and the words "further processing, cooling or freezing" were deleted from the terms of the encumbrance.

ANZCO treated the agreement as constituting the purchase of a "right to use" land under sch 14 of the ITA which was then spread as a deduction under s EA 3 ITA.

The Commissioner disagreed that the payment made by ANZCO to AFFCO under the settlement deed was depreciable intangible property and disallowed the deduction.

_ANZCO'S position_

ANZCO submitted it acquired a chose in action which was an item of intangible property. Further, this was an item of depreciable property as described in sections EE 6 to EE 8 of the ITA and the rights or interests it acquired from the settlement also fell within the definition of depreciable intangible property in s EE 62 of the ITA. The right to use land is listed as an item of depreciable property in sch 14 of the ITA and this is what ANZCO contend they receive under the settlement.

_The Commissioner's position_

The Commissioner submitted that all ANZCO secured as a result of the settlement was its release from the restriction on the use of its own property. The removal of the encumbrance reinstated rights that attached to its ownership of the land. In so doing the capital value of the land was enhanced. The value of the rights obtained would not depreciate over subsequent years. The payment made by ANZCO was therefore capital in nature and not capable of being the subject of any deduction.

The Commissioner argued the interest obtained by ANZCO was not a right to use land within sch 14. Furthermore, ANZCO obtained reinstated rights of ownership that do not decline in value as required by s EE 6(1) ITA and also the  rights did not constitute separate "property" distinct from the ownership of the land.

### Decision

_What did ANZCO obtain as a result of its settlement with AFFCO?_

Mander J considered that on the face of it a "right to use" the Waitara property was granted by the settlement deed. However, having considered the case law on this point (_Mills v Dowdall_ \[1983\] NZLR 154 (CA) at 159; _Re Securitibank Ltd_ (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136 (CA); _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 and _Buckley & Young Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485 (CA)), he concluded that "right to use" descriptor used in the terms of the contract cannot by itself be determinative. Rather, it is the legal character of the transaction that is actually entered into and the legal steps which are followed which are decisive.

The legal character of the transaction is to be ascertained by careful consideration of the contractual arrangements entered into. AFFCO did not hold or own any rights to use the Waitara property. The restriction contained in the original 1999 sale and purchase agreement did not equate to any retention by AFFCO of a right to use the property in any way. Rather, the covenant was negative in nature, restricting the use to which the Waitara property could be put.

Mander J considered the Court of Appeal's analysis from the earlier _ANZCO v AFFCO_ litigation confirmed that when AFFCO entered into the sale and purchase agreement with the third party in 1999, it did not retain any subset of rights attaching to the fee simple estate. What rights acquired to prevent the use of the land for certain purposes were distinct from that bundle of rights and in particular from the right to use the land.

His Honour considered that the amendment of the encumbrance by removing a restriction on existing rights which formed part of the fee simple estate held by ANZCO was not to be equated with a conveyance or grant of rights held or enjoyed by AFFCO. Underscoring this finding is the fact the restriction was limited to a finite period after which the covenant expired. Upon that event triggering, no "right to use land" passed to the land owner, rather the contractual restriction (the "chose in action") secured by the encumbrance would extinguish.

His Honour identified an inconsistency with ANZCO's argument that it held intangible property, being a "chose in action". This was because in the hands of the owner of the land, the chose in action upon which the claim for depreciation is dependent no longer exists. The property owner's rights are no longer encumbered and the chose in action, the right to enforce that aspect of the contract, evaporates. The intangible property of the type contended for by ANZCO therefore only exists as a separate item of property in the hands of AFFCO or another third party.

Mander J concluded that what ANZCO obtained from the settlement was not a "right to use land" but the removal of a contractual restriction over its existing rights of use.

**Did what ANZCO obtain constitute intangible depreciable property under the Act?**

_Was a "right to use land" as that term is to be interpreted in schedule 14 of the ITA acquired by ANZCO as a result of the settlement?_

Schedule 14 of the ITA lists "the right to use land" as an item of depreciable intangible property. ANZCO argued this term should bear its plain and natural meaning and this is what they obtained under the settlement. The Commissioner argued the rights or interests acquired did not fall within the Schedule.

Mander J, noting principles relevant to the interpretation of tax statutes, went on to consider sch 14 in the immediate and general legislative context. His Honour also cited the _Simkin Trust cases_ (_Trustees of the Simkin Trust v Commisioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2003\] 2 NZLR 315 (CA) and _Trustees in the CB Simkin Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2004\] UKPC 55, (2005) 22 NZTC 19,001) which provide a detailed analysis of (what is now) sch 14. One of the principles emerging from this was that sch 14 must be interpreted consistently with the criterion that the property must have a finite useful life and that it would in normal circumstances be expected to decline in value over time.

His Honour considered that requirement may be viewed as an amalgam of the criterion in s EE 62(2)(b) and the qualifying description of depreciable property in s EE 6(1), but that ultimately the effect is the same; intangible depreciable property cannot include property that does not have a limited useful life. Mander J went on to conclude that the rights obtained by ANZCO were the reinstated rights of ownership and did not have a finite life span.

_Was the "right to use land" depreciable property under section EE 6(1) of the ITA?_

Mander J considered that even if he were to proceed on the basis the interest or right conveyed under the settlement deed was capable of constituting a right to use land under sch 14, ANZCO must still satisfy the requirement of s EE 6(3)(b) that the intangible property was depreciable property under subs (1). In order to be depreciable, the item of intangible property must be property that in normal circumstances might reasonably be expected to decline in value while it is used or available for use in deriving assessable income or in carrying on a business for such purpose.

Mander J found that it was apparent that ANZCO was unable to satisfy the test because what was conveyed to ANZCO under the settlement deed was the restoration of inherent rights of ownership. The encumbrance held by AFFCO was for a limited period. However, once that period expired, ANZCO's full ownership rights would revive in perpetuity. ANZCO effectively bought out the restriction which prevented the use of its ownership rights which in normal circumstances would not be expected to decline in value. The reinstated rights of ANZCO to undertake further processing, cooling and freezing at the Waitara plant would continue to run with its ownership.

It was important to draw a distinction between what AFFCO held and what ANZCO received. The worth of the restrictive covenant declined over time, but it does not follow the value of the right to use the land reduced. ANZCO argued that what was conveyed to it was a right to use land but it relied on the value of the restriction on its use of the land in the hands of a competitor to meet the statutory requirement that the intangible property depreciated over time. This highlighted that what ANZCO acquired as a result of the settlement was not a right to use land but the discharge of a limitation over a right it already held as the owner of the fee simple state.

### Conclusion

Mander J concluded that what ANZCO obtained pursuant to the settlement deed was a variation of the encumbrance which secured a contractual restriction on the landowner's rights of ownership. AFFCO had no actual right to use the Waitara land to convey to ANZCO.

His Honour considered that the meaning of a "right to use land" as listed in sch 14 as depreciable intangible property does not extend to include rights which form part of the ownership of the fee simple estate. The rights to use the land which became available to ANZCO as a result of the settlement do not have finite useful life over which they will depreciate. As a consequence, the payment made by ANZCO to obtain the variation of the encumbrance in order to access those rights reflects the increased capital value of the property in the hands of the owner.

While the value of the restriction in AFFCO's hands as a competitor of ANZCO reduced as the period of the covenant diminished, the value of the rights to use the land which were restricted by the covenant would not diminish over time in the hands of the landowner. There could be no expectation that such property rights would decline in value while being used to derive assessable income. In the absence of the value of the rights to use the land declining, such intangible property does not qualify as depreciable property under the Act.

Although the settlement deed may describe the transaction in terms of AFFCO granting to ANZCO the right to use the Waitara property in a particular way, the true contractual nature of the settlement was that the ambit of the encumbrance was simply reduced. At that point there was no basis upon which the previously encumbered rights could reasonably be expected to decline in value.

High Court considers whether a repayment of a loan can generate an input tax deduction
======================================================================================

The matter was an appeal of a TRA decision, denying Mr Burke the right to claim additional input deductions for a payment made during the two-month taxable period ending 30 September 2007

Case

Darryl Patrick Burke v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 2569

Legal terms

Input tax, Repayment of a loan, Taxable supply, GST, Goods and Services

Legislative References

Goods and services tax

### Summary

The matter was an appeal of a Tax Review Authority (“the TRA”) decision, _TRA 08/18_ \[2019\] NZTRA 3, denying Mr Darryl Patrick Burke the right to claim additional input deductions for a payment made during the two-month taxable period ending 30 September 2007 (“the Disputed Period”). Mr Burke argued that the payment of $498,640.48 to his financier, Citywide Capital Limited (“CCL”), represented payment for the goods and services supplied to him during the development. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) viewed the payment as fulfilment of Mr Burke’s obligation under a loan agreement with CCL; the payment was not charged with goods and services tax (“GST”) and accordingly cannot generate an input tax deduction. The TRA agreed.

The High Court found in favour of the Commissioner. The reasons given by Justice Downs largely mirror those of Judge Sinclair from the TRA which the High Court held to have been “undoubtedly correct” (at \[18\]).

### Impact

The judgment reclarifies the fact that a repayment of a loan is not consideration for a supply.

### Facts

Mr Burke entered into a property venture in mid-2006 with CCL who provided funding for the purchase of two properties (secured by a mortgage) and the costs of developing the properties for sale. The loan agreement between Mr Burke and CCL resulted in suppliers being paid by CCL through draw downs on the development funds. The payments to suppliers increased the overall debt Mr Burke had with CCL, and the GST refunds received during the development of the properties which were paid to CCL by Mr Burke, were credited against his loan.

In August 2007, after the first property was sold, a payment of $498,640.48 (“August 2007 payment”) was made to CCL by Mr Burke. Mr Burke claimed that his unique financial arrangement with CCL meant that he only made payment of the invoices to the suppliers when he made the August 2007 payment. The fact that the supplier’s invoices had already been paid by CCL at the time, was not relevant to his position.

### Issues

The sole issue for the court to determine was whether the August 2007 payment should activate the deductibility of Mr Burke’s earlier expenses to offset his GST liability in the Disputed Period (at \[8\]).

### Decision

In dismissing the appeal in its entirety, Justice Downs agreed with the TRA that the August 2007 payment was a loan repayment; one required by the loan agreement between CCL and Mr Burke. Justice Downs held the payment “was obviously _not_ made to obtain supplies from his suppliers” and “this payment was not made in exchange for a good or service attracting GST” (at \[15\]; emphasis added by the Court).

Section 20(3) of the Good and Services Tax Act 1985 establishes how much GST is payable in a taxable period. Those who account for tax on a payment or hybrid basis are governed by s 20(3)(b)(i). It provides:

(3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period—

(b) in the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19, the amount of the following:

(i) input tax in relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6), to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period:

For a person using the payments or hybrid basis, the input tax is deducted from the output tax in relation to the supply of goods and services “to the extent……_a payment in respect of that supply has been made during a taxable period_” (at \[13\]; emphasis added by the Court).

Justice Downs held that s 20(3)(b)(i) answered Mr Burke’s case – Mr Burke was supplied goods in the three previous GST periods (ending March, May and July 2007) and these were paid by Mr Burke within these periods. He was entitled to, and he did claim, the corresponding input tax deductions within each of the three periods. “No further input tax deduction arose for the disputed period in terms of s 20(3)(b)(i); Mr Burke’s suppliers had already been paid” (at \[14\]). It did not matter who paid Mr Burke’s suppliers – they were paid.

Therefore, contrary to Mr Burke’s submission, there was no material linkage between the August 2007 payment and the goods earlier supplied to him. Mr Burke’s repayment to CCL did not somehow mean his suppliers were paid only then (at \[15\]).

High Court costs - accountancy fees were not properly claimable as a disbursement
=================================================================================

2017 case note - Court allowed the plaintiff's disbursements as claimed save for the plaintiff's accountancy fees - change of costs' classification.

Case

Patty Tzu Chou Lin v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 1548

Legislative References

Rule 14.2, 14.3, 14.5, 14.12 High Court Rules 2016

### Summary

On 12 May 2017 the High Court ("Court") gave judgment for the plaintiff and found that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessments and default assessments in respect of the plaintiff's income tax were incorrect. This judgment is currently under appeal.

The plaintiff subsequently sought costs on a category 3 basis in accordance with the High Court Rules 2016. The Commissioner disagreed with the calculation and allocation of costs.

The Court awarded the plaintiff costs on a category 3B basis, save that band C would be applied to the preparation of briefs and preparation for hearing. The Court also allowed the plaintiff's disbursements as claimed save for the plaintiff's accountancy fees which the Court said were not properly claimable as a disbursement.

### Impact

Accountancy fees cannot be claimed as a disbursement by a successful party in a proceeding unless it can be shown that they are specific to the conduct of the proceeding, reasonably necessary for the conduct of the proceedings and reasonable in amount.

### Facts

The plaintiff sought category 3 costs against the Commissioner of $92,070 plus disbursements of $24,374.30.

The Court determined the issue of costs on the papers.

### Decision

_**Category 2 or category 3?**_

On 29 February 2016 the parties filed a joint memorandum in advance of the first case management conference advising that the proceeding should be classified as a category 2 proceeding for costs purposes.

On 3 March 2016 the Court, satisfied with the contents of the joint memorandum, issued a Minute but did not record an allocation of the costs' category. On this basis, the plaintiff said that no costs category had ever been assigned.

The plaintiff submitted that the Court could appropriately categorise the proceeding as a category 3 (the current daily rate for Category 3 proceedings is $3,300 and $2,230 for Category 2 proceedings) as the view of the parties in the joint memorandum was irrelevant.

The plaintiff said that the proceeding should be classified as category 3 because of the complexities involved.

Furthermore, even if the parties' previous view in classifying the proceeding as category 3 was relevant, the plaintiff said that the parties understated the appropriate costs category and that the Court was free to allocate the proceeding an appropriate category at this stage.

The Commissioner responded that any change to the classification of a proceeding should be made at the point when it is apparent that the existing classification is not appropriate. In this case the change was raised for the first time in the plaintiff's costs submissions (post judgment). The Court agreed that the plaintiff was effectively requesting a change of costs' classification.

The main issue was whether "special reasons" existed to justify post hearing re-categorisation of costs from category 2 to category 3.

The Commissioner did not disagree with the plaintiff's assessment of the factors for why category 3 would be appropriate but contended that was nothing to justify a change which would amount to a "special reason" (Rule 14.3 High Court Rules 2016 and _Body Corporate No 189855 v North Shore City Council (Costs)_ HC Auckland CIV-2005-404-5561, 2 October 2008 and _J L Tindall & Ors v Far North District Council_ (unreported HC AK CIV 2003-488-000135 25 May 2005))

The Court said that one of the fundamental principles applying to determination of costs is that the award should reflect the complexity and significance of the proceeding.

In the usual course, and particularly in light of policy considerations, the Court said that it is unlikely that special reasons would be found where there is only a change of opinion regarding the adequacy of the initial categorisation.

However, in the circumstances of this case, the Court held that the way in which the proceeding developed does amount to special reasons and therefore category 3 would be appropriate.

_**Increased time bands**_

The plaintiff sought an increased time band from B to C in respect of preparation of briefs, preparation for hearing and supplementary submissions.

The Commissioner opposed the increase, noting there was no factual evidence at the hearing and, given the only evidence was expert evidence, the Commissioner did not accept that the plaintiff's counsel was required to undertake significant attendances in preparing the brief. Rather, the Commissioner submitted that minimal input would have been required having also pointed out that the plaintiff's principal counsel was an experienced tax barrister.

The main issue was whether "a comparatively large amount of time for the particular steps is considered reasonable" in which case band C should be allocated, or whether a "normal amount of time is considered reasonable", in which case band B should be allocated (Rule 14.5(2) High Court Rules 2016).

The Court was satisfied that a comparatively large amount of time would have been required for preparation of the expert brief and for the hearing. However, the Court was not satisfied that a large amount of time would have been required for the supplementary submissions.

The Court allocated band C for the preparation of briefs and preparation for hearing only and band B for all other matters.

**_Disbursements: accountancy fees_**

The Commissioner objected to the plaintiff's claim for the accountancy fees charged by her accountant.

The plaintiff claimed these fees as a disbursement, being a necessary and reasonable expense paid by her specifically for the purposes of the proceeding (Rule 14.12 High Court Rules 2016).

The Court held that these fees do not fall under HCR 14.12 and therefore need to be approved by the Court.

The Court agreed with the Commissioner's approach that, given the plaintiff engaged counsel with specialist skill in tax law, and was represented by two counsel at the hearing, with a highly qualified expert, there was no need to have the assistance of a chartered accountant.

On that basis the Court held that these fees were not properly claimable as a disbursement.

**_Result_**

The plaintiff was awarded costs on a category 3B basis, save that band C was to be applied to the preparation of briefs and the hearing.

The plaintiff was awarded disbursements as claimed with the exception of the accountancy fees which were disallowed.

High Court declines to add new defendants to tax litigation
===========================================================

2010 case note – taxpayer's application to add more parties to long-running litigation denied by High Court - joinder of parties.

Case

"Y" Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer sought to add more parties to long-running litigation on the basis that the Commissioner had not correctly identified a tax avoidance arrangement and that without the other parties no one was capable of paying the taxes if the Commissioner was ultimately successful. The application was declined by the High Court.

### Impact of decision

The decision rebuts any suggestion that liability to taxes should be linked to recovery of the same taxes when a tax challenge is proceeding. The same logic would apply to the disputes process under the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). First the liability to pay taxes needs to be established prior to any issue of recovery being addressed.

The decision is clear that argument regarding the scope of the arrangement does not necessitate adding additional parties and such addition would be detrimental to those parties.

### Facts

This was an interlocutory application by the taxpayer to add further defendants to the case. This is possible under High Court Rule 4.56(1).

The case was a tax challenge by Y Limited against assessments made by the Commissioner on the basis of tax avoidance by the taxpayer for the income tax years 1996 to 1998 inclusive.

The taxpayer argued that certain banks should be added to the proceedings because the:

1.  banks were said to have owed money to Y Limited under the arrangement and without recovery by Y Limited against the banks the Commissioner would not be able to recover any taxes owed from Y Limited
2.  Commissioner's identified tax avoidance arrangement was wrong and should include a purported wider tax avoidance arrangement the taxpayer had identified and a resulting advantage to the banks
3.  Commissioner had a duty under section 6A (3) of the TAA to collect the highest net revenue, and that implied joining the banks to assure recovery.

The Commissioner opposed the application on the following grounds:

1.  The issue of _recovery_ was irrelevant to a challenge about the _liability_ for the taxes. The two matters were separate issues and could not be run together. This also addressed the section 6A argument advanced by Y Limited.
2.  There was no arrangement involving the banks and, if there were, it did not excuse the tax advantage obtained by Y Limited.

### Decision

Justice Mackenzie declined to add the banks and dismissed the application. Of each ground the Judge concluded:

> The present proceeding is concerned only with the determination of the extent of the plaintiff's tax liability. It is not concerned with recovery by the Commissioner of the amount of that tax liability. That would be a later stage. Only at that later stage of collection of tax could the Commissioner's duty under section 6A (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have any relevance. Further, if it were relevant, it is for the Commissioner, not this Court, to determine how that duty is fulfilled. The Commissioner has a wide managerial discretion as to the best means of obtaining the highest net return. I do not consider that section 6A provides any support for the proposition that, either in the ordinary case which I have described or in this case, debt recovery proceedings against a third party should be joined with a challenge to the Commissioner's assessment \[17\].  
> The Commissioner has not taken any steps against the banks alleging that they are parties to a tax avoidance arrangement so as to affect their tax liability. If the banks were joined as parties, and if the plaintiff were successful in its contention that the banks were involved in a wider tax avoidance arrangement, then the banks would, as parties, be bound, as a matter of _res judicata_, by the Court's findings on that issue. That might expose the banks to subsequent reassessment by the Commissioner, which the banks might not be able to fully defend under the usual processes, by reason of the findings in this litigation \[24\].  
> On the other hand, Y \[Limited\] will not be precluded from making any arguments which it may wish to make as to the extent of any wider tax avoidance arrangement, so far as that may affect the tax liability of Y \[Limited\], if the banks are not parties. Full details of the arrangement will (subject to the constraints of the Tax Administration Act) be able to be adduced, if the banks are not parties. Any necessary evidence from the banks can be obtained, if the banks are not parties, by the use of the available interlocutory proceedings \[25\].

High Court dismisses judicial review application
================================================

2005 case note - CIR's refusal to accept settlement offers were not unreasonable and did not breach statutory duties – Judicial review, highest net revenue.

Case

Rogerson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), sections 6, 6A, 176, 141E and 177C

### Summary

The Commissioner's refusals to accept the taxpayer's settlement offers were not unreasonable and did not breach any statutory duties under section 176 TAA: _Raynel & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 and _Clarke v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_; _Money v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (unreported HC Auckland CIV 2003-404-5631 and CIV 2003-404-2148 applied). The Commissioner was entitled, indeed obliged, to take into account that acceptance of the amounts variously offered, which did not nearly equate with the taxpayer's tax debt, would not protect the integrity of the tax system, nor ultimately collect the highest tax revenue, given the taxpayer's compliance history. The Commissioner was precluded by sections 141E(2) and 177C TAA from accepting the settlement offers.

### Facts

The taxpayer, Mr Rogerson, had a long history of non-compliance with tax reporting requirements and non-payment of tax assessed in relation to various related entities, resulting in significant tax arrears.

On 30 May 2000 the Commissioner met with the taxpayer to discuss the arrears. The taxpayer said he had no funds. Subsequently the Commissioner issued NOPAs to the taxpayer and the related entities. The assessments included shortfall penalties. On 18 March 2003 the Commissioner obtained judgment against the taxpayer for $18,658.55.

During 2003, Mr Rogerson made several offers of settlement, which the Commissioner rejected. The Commissioner contended the offers could not be accepted because: (1) section 177C(3) TAA precluded the Commissioner from writing off any amount of outstanding tax if the taxpayer was liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or similar act in respect of that tax; and (2) such a write-off would not promote the principles of voluntary compliance, protection of the integrity of the tax system or ultimately collect the highest net revenue.

The Commissioner applied to have the taxpayer adjudged bankrupt. The taxpayer sought to have the bankruptcy application set aside on the grounds that the Commissioner's refusal of the settlement offers was in breach of the statutory duties under sections 6A and 176 TAA, as there was no evidence that bankruptcy would recover the most revenue over time. The taxpayer also argued that he was suffering from a mental condition that led him to ignore the letters from the Commissioner demanding payment.

Subsequently the Commissioner prosecuted Mr Rogerson and a related entity under section 143A(1)(d) TAA for nine counts of knowingly applying or permitting the application of amounts deducted from employees' wages for a purpose other than payment to the Commissioner. The jury found on the balance of probabilities that the failures to account were due to a cause beyond the taxpayer's control (being his mental disorder of which evidence was given at the trial), and that the amounts due had been accounted for.

Following the trial the Commissioner declined to accept a further settlement offer from the taxpayer because of his continued non-compliance with his tax obligations and his continued failure to pay the outstanding tax.

The taxpayer applied for judicial review of the Commissioner's decisions to refuse to accept the settlement offers. He argued that the decisions:

(1) breached a statutory duty to collect the highest revenue over time; and (2) were unreasonable. He also sought a declaration setting aside the bankruptcy application and the shortfall penalties.

### Decision

Potter J, finding for the Commissioner, dismissed the application for judicial review.

Potter J held that the Commissioner had not breached a statutory duty to collect the highest revenue over time in refusing to accept the settlement offers. The duty imposed by section 6A(3) TAA applied notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, and therefore section 6A(3) TAA prevailed over section 176 TAA. The obligation to collect the highest net revenue was not absolute. The Commissioner was only required to take steps to recover revenue which were practicable and lawful. The Commissioner was required to have regard to the resources available, the importance of promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers, and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. The cornerstone of the taxation system was the concept of voluntary compliance. Taxpayers who complied with the requirements of the Inland Revenue Acts were entitled to expect that appropriate and (where necessary) firm action would be taken against taxpayers who shirked their obligations. The Commissioner was entitled, indeed obliged, to take into account that acceptance of the amounts variously offered, which did not nearly equate with the taxpayer's tax debt, would not protect the integrity of the tax system, nor ultimately collect the highest tax revenue, given the taxpayer's compliance history.

On the second issue, Potter J held that the Commissioner's decision to decline to accept the settlement offers was not unreasonable. Section 141E(2) TAA which provided for situations when a shortfall penalty for tax evasion under section 141E(1)(b) TAA should not be chargeable, expressly required as a condition of the exercise by the Commissioner of a discretion in the matter, that the taxpayer had honoured the taxpayer's obligations to the Commissioner and to the taxation system as a whole, by accounting for the deduction for which the taxpayer was liable. Unless the Commissioner could be satisfied that the taxpayer had met those obligations, the Commissioner was precluded from exercising a discretion under section 141E(2) TAA. Similarly under section 177C, outstanding tax including shortfall penalties could not be written off if the taxpayer was liable for shortfall penalties for evasion. The taxpayer had not accounted for the amount of the deductions in terms of s 141E(2) TAA and there was no jurisdiction under section 177C TAA to write off tax because the taxpayer remained liable for shortfall penalties. For the Commissioner to exercise the discretion under section 141E(2) the Commissioner had to be satisfied that the failure to account for the relevant deductions within the prescribed time was due to illness, accident or some other cause beyond the taxpayer's control. The Commissioner was concerned with a much longer period than the period to which the nine charges related, and with a wider spectrum of non-compliance. The discretion under section 141E(2) TAA (if it arose) had to be exercised solely by the Commissioner. There was nothing irrational or unreasonable about the Commissioner's decision, or the matters taken into account in reaching it.

============================================================================================================================

2016 case note – Taxpayer's appeal dismissed, CIR's assessment an honest appraisal and genuine exercise of judgement - Income under ordinary concepts.

Case

Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 934

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The High Court dismissed Mr Musuku's appeal and upheld the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("Commissioner's") assessment as an honest appraisal and genuine exercise of judgement. Justice Moore agreed with the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") that the amounts assessed were dividend income under s CD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 ("Act"), employment income under s CE 1 of the Act or income under ordinary concepts under s CA 1 of the Act.

### Facts

Mr Musuku ("the appellant") was a director and shareholder of three pharmacy owning companies which employed him as a pharmacist. The appellant was also the trustee of the Musuku Family Trust ("Trust") and a director and shareholder of another closely held company.

At the time the Commissioner commenced her review of the appellant's tax affairs, the appellant had not filed a tax return for six years, two of his companies had failed to submit goods and service tax returns since incorporation, one of his companies had last filed an income tax return three tax years prior and the Trust and one of his companies did not have an IRD number and had not filed any returns.

The Commissioner's investigation occupied some seven years. Finally, in the face of the appellant's effective refusal to co-operate, the Commissioner made a default income tax assessment for the 2006 tax year. The resulting disputes phase was also protracted. The Disputes Review Unit upheld the Commissioner's statement of position in late July 2013 and an amended assessment was made on the basis that amounts deposited into various business and personal bank accounts to which the appellant had access and that were spent on his behalf and to his private benefit or were made available to him, was his taxable income as dividend income, employment income or income under ordinary concepts.

The TRA delivered a reserved decision on 27 July 2015 confirming that the appellant had not discharged the onus on him to prove on the balance of probabilities that (a) the amended assessment (and/or default assessment) was arbitrary and not a genuine attempt by the Commissioner to assess the appellant's taxable income and/or (b) the amended assessment was incorrect and, if so, by how much.

The appeal proceeded by way of a re-hearing.

### Decision

_Did the Commissioner fail to issue a proper assessment?_

The appellant made three claims. Firstly, that the default and amended assessments were arbitrary. Secondly, that the assessments were not made on a credible or reasonable basis. Thirdly, that the assessments did not fully apply known facts and law.

Justice Moore held that on the evidence it was apparent that the Commissioner went to considerable lengths to ascertain the appellant's correct tax position and exhibited commendable patience in the face of a wide range of frustrations and difficulties in completing the enquiry in a timely way.

His Honour held that he was easily satisfied that the Commissioner's amended assessment and earlier default assessment were, in each case, an honest appraisal of the appellant's tax position and a genuine exercise of judgement.

_Was the Commissioner's assessment incorrect?_

_Dividend income_

Justice Moore found that the appellant had received amounts into his joint bank account from his companies which he retained and used for his private benefit Furthermore, his Honour found that the appellant had received the benefit of amounts spent by his companies for his private benefit.

His Honour was satisfied that the transfers of value from the companies would not have been made but for the appellant's shareholding. Furthermore, his Honour held that no reliable or credible evidence of loans or drawings existed and the information provided with the appellant's notice of proposed adjustment (including the schedule of current accounts) appeared to have been created in an attempt to retrospectively justify the appellant's position, namely that the amounts were drawings and not dividends.

His Honour held that the appellant could be taken to have derived as dividend income under s CD 1 of the Act an amount equal to the private expenditure.

_Employment income_

Justice Moore agreed with the Commissioner that s CE 1(1)(g) of the Act casts a wide net to include in a person's employment income a cash amount derived that has a connection with their employment or service, even if that amount falls outside of the specific categories in s CE 1 of the Act.

His Honour held that to the extent the funds the companies made available to him were not dividends they would be his employment income under s CE 1 of the Act. In reaching this conclusion Justice Moore referred to the appellant's income protection insurance and the appellant's $19,000 declared salary which was not commensurate with the work undertaken by him.

_Income under ordinary concepts_

Justice Moore was also satisfied that if the amounts were not dividend income or income received as an employee then it would be income under ordinary concepts under s CA 1 of the Act.

_Rent payments_

Furthermore, his Honour was satisfied that rent payments made into the joint account of the appellant and his wife were income to the appellant under ordinary concepts.

_Appeal dismissed and costs awarded_

The appellant's appeal was dismissed and costs were awarded in favour of the Commissioner on a category 3 basis.

High Court finds for Commissioner on tax avoidance and imposes an abusive tax position shortfall penalty
========================================================================================================

2016 case note – High Court found taxpayer engaged in an arrangement that had a tax avoidance purpose or effect and CIR correct to disallow GST refund.

Case

Tale Holdings Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 141D, 141FB and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ss 9, 11, 76

### Summary

Tale Holdings Limited ("Tale") entered into an arrangement to purchase a property development ("Delta") from Te Anau Lakeside Estates Limited ("Te Anau") facing liquidation action. Under the arrangement the purchase price was set according to the amount owed under Te Anau's mortgage. Tale took the property subject to the mortgage and paid no money to Te Anau. Tale claimed a goods and services tax ("GST") input tax deduction for the tax fraction of the purchase price and Te Anau did not pay any GST output tax. The Court held that:

*   Tale was engaged in an arrangement that had a tax avoidance purpose or effect that was not merely incidental;
*   The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was correct to disallow the whole of the GST refund sought by Tale; and
*   The Commissioner’s assessment of a shortfall penalty was correct.

### Impact

The black letter law position in this case was determined under the GST legislation prior to 1 April 2011 (after which date transactions between GST-registered parties involving land, or in which land is a component, are mandatorily zero-rated). On black letter law the taxpayer was allowed the GST input claim, but the High Court upheld the voiding of the arrangement as tax avoidance.

### Facts

Tale acquired a land subdivision called Delta from Te Anau. Tale did not pay any money for Delta. Instead, Tale acquired Delta on the basis it would accept liability for a debt of approximately $8.5 million, which Te Anau owed the bank. At the time, the rateable value of Delta was approximately $4.2 million and its market value was approximately $3.2 million.

Tale claimed a GST refund of $936,629 based upon the "purchase price" of Delta and Te Anau did not pay any output tax on the sale of Delta to Tale.

The Commissioner concluded Tale was engaged in a tax avoidance arrangement and also imposed an abusive tax position shortfall penalty (ATP shortfall penalty) of 100 per cent, reduced by 50 per cent for previous good behaviour in accordance with s 141FB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), of the GST refund denied to Tale.

### Decision

_**Was there an arrangement for the purposes of s 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act")?**_

Tale argued that the Commissioner identified in her submissions two new steps in the arrangement (compared to in her Statement of Position) and that the inability of the Commissioner to accurately identify what the alleged arrangement was pointed to the fact that there was no agreement which could be identified as constituting an arrangement.

The Court considered that although the Commissioner should be as precise as possible when identifying what constitutes an arrangement (in the dispute process documents), the Commissioner’s statutory obligations do not extend to providing the taxpayer with an extensive analysis of the facts and law she relies upon; rather the Commissioner must provide a concise statement of the key facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform of the grounds of the proposed adjustment (TAA, s 89F(2)(b).

The Court noted that aspects of the Commissioner’s case about what constituted the arrangement had evolved, there were five key elements that remained since the time the Commissioner issued her Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") that satisfied the definition of "arrangement."

_**Did the arrangement have a tax avoidance purpose or effect?**_

In order to identify whether the arrangement in this case had a tax avoidance purpose or effect, the Court first focussed on the objectives of the GST regime, and then upon the effect and purpose of the arrangement.

The Court found particular relevance in two features of the GST regime: (1) that transactions will be driven by market forces; and (2) that over time there will be a netting off of the GST components of sales and purchases - the Act does not contemplate a taxpayer claiming GST input tax credits when there is no possibility of output tax being paid over time.

In determining the purpose of the arrangement, the Court focused on the artificiality of the purchase price, the fact that Tale did not pay anything for Delta and that the transaction was unlikely to result in GST being paid.

As to the artificiality of the purchase price, the Court noted that Tale did not obtain an independent valuation of Delta to determine if the purchase price was consistent with the market value.

The Court noted that the assumptions made by Tale’s witnesses regarding the value of Delta at the time of purchase were very optimistic and Tale did not call any independent evidence to support those assumptions or to challenge the conclusions of the expert called by the Commissioner concerning the market value of Delta at the time of purchase. The Court found that the expert’s assessment of the market value of Delta at $3,200,000 at the time Tale acquired it was accurate.

The Court was satisfied that the transaction at the heart of the arrangement was not a normal commercial transaction because the shareholders of Tale did not provide any equity and had no capital at risk and because Tale acquired Delta at a price which was set by reference to Te Anau’s debt to the bank, not the market value of the land in question.

The Court also considered that because Tale would be unlikely to sell Delta at a price greater than the amount required to pay the bank mortgage in full, Tale would only ever be able to pay output tax on the sale of Delta to the extent that the bank would allow. This would result in Tale claiming and recovering an input tax deduction and not paying the output tax that would normally be expected to be present where transactions are governed by ordinary market forces. This is exactly what transpired. Allowing Tale to obtain a GST refund for the acquisition of Delta in such circumstances defeats the revenue collection purpose of the GST Act and does not result in netting off of inputs and outputs over time.

The Court accordingly held that the arrangement in this case was designed to alter the incidence of GST in a way which could not have been within the contemplation of Parliament. As a result, the arrangement clearly had a tax avoidance purpose or effect.

_**Did the arrangement have a tax avoidance purpose or effect which was not merely incidental?**_

The Court held that the tax avoidance purpose or effect of this arrangement was more than merely incidental because:

1.  Tale acknowledged that it was part of the plan it engaged in that it would receive a GST refund, which was to be applied to the debt owed to the bank;
2.  Tale accepted that obtaining the GST refund was a key objective in itself. The refund was likely to be its most significant source of revenue, at least in the initial state of development and sales by Tale; and
3.  The GST refund sought was based on a contrived and artificial price that had no resemblance to the true market value of Delta which involved the suspension of ordinary market forces.

_**Was it wrong for the Commissioner to disallow the entire GST refund sought by Tale?**_

Tale suggested that if the transaction had an inflated value then the Commissioner was required to reconstruct the transaction and assign an appropriate value to it in order to calculate the GST refund to which Tale was entitled. However, the Commissioner did not undertake an adjustment under s 76(3) of the GST Act. The onus was accordingly on Tale to demonstrate that the transaction could not have been zero-rated and that commercial objectives were connected to the arrangement.

The Court held that although Tale had not been registered for GST at the time of sale and there was no agreement in writing that the supply was of a going concern, the sale by Te Anau to Tale was in all other respects of a going concern which was able to be zero-rated for GST purposes. There was no reason why Tale could not have achieved its alleged commercial objectives by entering into the arrangement in a way that was tax neutral and did not involve tax avoidance.

_**Was the Commissioner’s assessment of a shortfall penalty correct?**_

The Court considered that there were similarities between this arrangement and the one in _Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 116, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359. In both cases the purchaser was a shell company, the price was not paid in economic terms, the price "paid" was inflated and GST was not paid by the vendor. The Court concluded that at the time Tale took its tax position there was significant Supreme Court case law which strongly indicated the position being taken by Tale was not, when viewed objectively, likely to be correct. The Commissioner was therefore correct when she assessed Tale as being liable for an Abusive Tax Position shortfall penalty under s 141D of the TAA.

High Court finds in favour of retrospective departure orders
============================================================

2011 case note - High Court finds in favour of retrospective departure orders in relation to a child support matter.

Case

B v X & Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Child Support Act 1991

### Summary

The non-custodial parent had appealed the findings of the Family Court awarding a departure order from formula assessment in favour of the custodial parent. The non-custodial parent appealed on a number of grounds. The reason the Commissioner intervened in this matter was primarily because of one ground whereby the non-custodial parent argued that there is no jurisdiction for the Commissioner to make retrospective departure orders.

### Impact of decision

There are several differing decisions in the High Court as to whether retrospective departure orders from formula assessments can be made. However, in light of _IPD v KME_ \[2008\] 2 NZLR 523, and now _B v X & Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ it does seem clearer that the recent jurisprudence favours retrospectivity.

As this case is under appeal by the respondent, the Commissioner will seek leave of the High Court to have the "retrospectivity" question of law determined by the Court of Appeal.

### Facts

This is a child support matter where the non-custodial parent is challenging a Family Court ruling whereby the Family Court granted an application by the custodial parent for a departure from a formula assessment of child support under the Child Support Act 1991. The formula assessment had been varied to be the maximum allowable for the years in question, as well as two other payments to meet the special needs of two of the children. As Fogarty J put it: "At the heart of the dispute is a contention that the father avoided child support by diverting much of his income to a trust, which he controlled, which in turn returned that income to him in a non-taxable character."

### Decision

#### _Issue 1_

Fogarty J agreed that departure orders from formula assessments can be granted retrospectively. Although he did emphasise that the criteria regarding the application of departure orders has to take into account the facts and circumstances, not just of the years to which the departure orders will apply but also the facts and circumstances that exist when the application for the departure order is made. This is best summarised in \[33\] of Fogarty J's judgment:

*   I conclude that retrospective orders can be made. However, considerable care has to be made to ensure that at the time they are made the consequences of such orders are just and equitable and appropriate \[s 105(4)\].

#### _Issue 2_

Fogarty J differed with the calculations as to the non-custodial parent's level of income. He also did not adopt wholeheartedly the evidence of either party's accountants.

#### _Issue 3_

Although obiter and not of primary importance to the Commissioner in this case, it is worth noting that Fogarty J seems to disagree with the reasoning of the High Court in _F v W_ (where the District Court was found to not have the equitable jurisdiction to declare a trust a sham). Fogarty J states at \[73\]:

*   I do not see any issue of sham or not to be resolved by the law of equity. Rather the law of sham is part of the common law of fraud. A sham exists where there is an intention to conceal the true nature of any transaction.

Regarding whether the trust in question was itself a sham, Fogarty J found that while not a sham, he had no problem with the family court attributing the net cashflow of a business as income of the non-custodial parent.

#### _Issue 4_

Fogarty J disagreed with the Family Court's quantum of the lump-sum payment required by the departure order. He felt that it was not just and equitable for such a lump-sum payment, and the financial hardship that entails, to be placed on the non-custodial parent. He therefore varied the near $300,000 owing, down to $30,000 plus the two special payments (being $6,372.21 and $5,734.08) and interest.

High Court finds no jurisdiction to judicially review the Commissioner's reassessment of goods and services tax
===============================================================================================================

2013 case note – High Court finds no jurisdiction to judicially review the CIR's reassessment of GST - natural justice, maladministration, deemed acceptance.

Case

Peter William Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust v Commissioner of Inland Revenue & Registrar of the Taxation Review Authority \[2013\] NZHC 3564

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994, Interpretation Act 1999

### Summary

The plaintiff applied for judicial review of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") reassessment of goods and services tax ("GST") on a number of grounds. The Commissioner objected to the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear and determine the causes of action based on _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158, \[2012\] 2 NZLR ("_Tannadyce_"). The High Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine the matter, as the proscription in section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") prevents litigation of "disputable decisions."

### Impact of decision

The Courts will uphold the decision on _Tannadyce_.

### Facts

The Forest Trust ("the Trust") claimed a refund of $67,011.65 for the GST period ended 31 July 2009. The Commissioner used section 89C(eb) of the TAA to make a reassessment of that amount, which she reassessed to nil, without issuing a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA").

The Trust issued its own NOPA in relation to that reassessment, and the Commissioner responded with her notice of response ("NOR"). The Trust claimed that the Commissioner's NOR was issued out of time and therefore the Commissioner was deemed to have accepted the Trust's adjustment.

The trustee of the Trust, Peter Mawhinney, applied for judicial review in relation to the Commissioner's reassessment, pleading five separate but interconnected grounds:

1.  The Commissioner's use of section 89C(eb) was unlawful as the section does not authorise the Commissioner to assess or disallow refunds. Further, there is nothing in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 that excludes GST from being applied to fraudulent activity.
2.  The Commissioner's reassessment was made in breach of natural justice.
3.  The Commissioner's failure to reassess the corresponding output tax in the GST period ended 30 September 2010 was unreasonable and amounted to conscious maladministration.
4.  The Commissioner failed to respond to the Trust's NOPA in time and so the Trust's NOPA was deemed to be accepted under section 89H(2) of the TAA.
5.  The Commissioner breached three statutory duties:
    1.  a duty under the Interpretation Act 1999 to interpret the Inland Revenue Acts by ascertaining their meaning from their text and in light of their purpose;
    2.  a duty under section 111 of the TAA to issue a NOPA to the Trust as soon as convenient after making an assessment; and
    3.  a duty to observe the principles of natural justice.

The Commissioner objected to jurisdiction on the basis that the statutory disputes and challenge procedures under Parts 4A and 8A of the TAA preclude judicial review, in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in _Tannadyce_.

### Decision

The Court found that Mr Mawhinney could invoke the statutory disputes and challenge procedure to raise each of the five issues.

#### _Issue 1_

The proper assessment of the GST in question was plainly a matter that was able to be resolved in the statutory disputes and challenge procedure. Anything of relevance to the correct assessment could be considered in that process, including the fraudulent activity issue.

#### _Issue 2_

Any relevant breach of natural justice could be resolved or ameliorated in the disputes and challenge procedure because that procedure involves the potential exercise of the same powers that are available to the High Court on an application for judicial review.

#### _Issue 3_

The Commissioner had issued a NOPA in respect of the period ended 30 September 2010. Accordingly, Mr Mawhinney was able to have the Commissioner's failure to reassess the corresponding output tax considered and determined in the disputes and challenge process.

#### _Issue 4_

The issue concerning whether the Commissioner was deemed to have accepted the Trust's NOPA was one that could be considered in the disputes and challenge process.

#### _Issue 5_

Each of the alleged breaches of statutory duty could be raised and considered in the disputes and challenge process.

#### _Conclusion_

Accordingly, the Court had no jurisdiction to determine the causes of action against the Commissioner and the application as against the Commissioner was dismissed.

### _Costs_

The Court understood Mr Mawhinney to be an undischarged bankrupt and therefore inferred no issue as to costs arose.

High Court finds no reviewable error made by Commissioner
=========================================================

2009 case note - High Court found CIR's decision was focused on the correct test -serious hardship, minimum living standards, judicial review.

Case

Larmer v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The judicial review proceeding failed as the High Court found that the Commissioner's decision was focused on the correct and appropriate statutory test and no error of law was demonstrated.

### Impact of decision

Further consideration is being given by Inland Revenue to its application of the serious hardship provisions. Current procedures should continue to be followed until further notice.

The household expenditure guide is a tool to assist the Commissioner but it is a value judgment for the Commissioner whether or not a particular taxpayer is able to meet the minimum living expenses according to normal community standards.

### Facts

The taxpayer had arrears of income tax and goods and services tax ("GST") amounting to $175,641.68. Inland Revenue had commenced debt recovery proceedings in the District Court.

In July 2008, the taxpayer had applied for financial relief under the serious hardship provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") claiming that her serious hardship was the result of significant financial difficulty that arose from her inability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards. The Commissioner declined her application for relief and the taxpayer judicially reviewed that decision. At a settlement conference it was agreed that the Commissioner would consider a new application for relief.

In December 2008, the taxpayer filed the new application for relief. The Commissioner determined that she met the criteria for serious hardship in respect of the income years ended 31 March 2000 to 31 March 2003 but not during tax years subsequent to 2003. The taxpayer applied for judicial review of this second decision declining relief for the years subsequent to 2003.

### Decision

#### Global v Year by year

A taxpayer's claim, under section 177(1)(a) of the TAA, must state why recovery of outstanding tax would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. Serious hardship is defined in section 177A as including significant financial difficulties that arise because of the taxpayer's inability to meet minimum expenses according to normal community standards; section 177A(1)(a)(i).

This does not include significant financial difficulties that arise because the taxpayer is obligated to pay tax.

The Commissioner's approach was to consider whether, in the year the obligation to pay the tax arose, the taxpayer was able to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards and if not, to grant relief. Each tax year was considered individually, not all tax years together. The Court found that this approach was correct.

Such an approach is a practical way of reconciling the "rather difficult interrelationship" between paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 177A of the TAA. The global approach - considering the position at the time the application is made - would potentially:

1.  advantage a taxpayer who failed to pay tax in the year the obligation to pay the tax arose when financially able to do so but was financially unable when applying for relief; or
2.  disadvantage a taxpayer who failed to pay tax in the year the obligation to pay the tax arose when financially unable to do so but was financially able when applying for relief.

Such outcomes would be inconsistent with the scheme and purpose of the TAA. The financial hardship regime focuses on the ability of the taxpayer to pay the tax at the time when the tax became payable.

The Court found:

*   The exclusion from consideration, as possible grounds of serious hardship, of difficulties arising because of the obligation to pay tax, indicates a clear legislative intention that defaulting taxpayers may be pursued to a point which may result in serious hardship. That suggests the appropriate focus is the ability to pay the tax when the obligation arose, rather than at the point when enforcement proceedings are taken. \[paragraph 14\]

#### Minimum living standards

The taxpayer questioned the way in which the Commissioner applied the household debt expenditure guide. The guide sets out figures for the weekly average expenditure on certain items for different categories of household; the relevant one here being a one-person household.

The Court found that the guide is a tool to assist the Commissioner in determining what the minimum living expenses according to normal community standards for the particular taxpayer are. It is, however, a value judgment for the Commissioner.

#### Judicial review

The Court confirmed that an application for judicial review is not an appeal against the Commissioner's decision. The onus is on the taxpayer to demonstrate the Commissioner has erred in law in adopting the approach that he has. Here, the taxpayer had fallen well short of demonstrating that the use of the household expenditure guide constituted a reviewable error.

The taxpayer's submission that the Commissioner erred in his assessment of the information available is one that goes to the merits that might be relevant to an appeal. However, there was no error of law or principle, within the purview of judicial review that had been demonstrated by the taxpayer.

Finally, there was no substance to the taxpayer's submission that there was no specific reference in the Commissioner's letters to the statutory definition of serious hardship or whether the test had been met. It is clear that the Commissioner's decision was correctly focused on the correct statutory test and no error of law had been demonstrated.

The Court found the application for judicial review failed.

High Court finds tax avoidance in an arrangement to develop and sell software
=============================================================================

2010 case note - confirms that arrangements involving mismatches in GST accounting and payments bases will be considered tax avoidance arrangements.

Case

Education Administration Limited v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

The High Court found an arrangement whereby two companies deliberately registered for GST on a mismatched accounting basis and incorporated by non-arm's length individuals for the purpose of developing and selling software was tax avoidance. Consequently, the Commissioner's decision to treat the arrangement as void was correct.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that artificial and contrived arrangements involving mismatches in goods and services tax (GST) accounting and payments bases will be struck down by the Court as tax avoidance arrangements.

### Facts

In 2001, Mr Grove was managing two Kip McGrath Education Centres ("the Centres") owned by his mother. He entered into an agreement with his mother's accountant Mr Grimmett to develop a software program for recording financial information that could be tailored to the Centres' needs. Two separate companies, the Taxpayer owned by Mr Grove's trust and Administration Systems Development Limited ("ASDL") owned by Mr Grimmett were established.

ASDL was responsible for developing the software and the Taxpayer was responsible for marketing and selling it once it was developed.

The Taxpayer was registered for goods and services tax (GST) on the invoice basis (filing its returns each month) and ASDL was registered for GST on the payments basis (filing its returns every six months). It was acknowledged that the registrations had been done this way deliberately as a means of generating funding for the development of the software.

The Commissioner assessed the Taxpayer by disallowing its tax input credits on the grounds of tax avoidance.

### Decision

Her honour Justice French found that the arrangement had tax avoidance as a more than merely incidental purpose or effect and was structured in a way that could not have been contemplated by Parliament. The arrangement was found to be artificial and contrived in the manner described in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited & Ors v CIR_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 (SC). In coming to this decision Justice French considered the following factors to be significant.

#### The relationship between the parties

It was considered that the creation of the two companies was pivotal to obtaining a GST benefit. Also the relationship and dealings between Mr Grove and Mr Grimmett were not at arm's length and were considered to be more in the nature of a joint venture rather than separate businesses. The Court could see no reason why the different objectives could not have been accommodated or recognised within a single company and two separate entities were not necessary.

#### The terms of the agreement between the Taxpayer and ASDL

The Court considered that the agreement contained some unusual features. Significantly the Taxpayer was only required to pay 10% of each of ASDL's invoices with the remaining 90% to be paid at some unspecified time in the future with no interest being charged and payment being conditional on revenue generated by sales. The agreement was in effect an interest-free loan and as such the Taxpayer was not subject to a real economic burden. The Taxpayer was therefore considered to be using the Act in a way Parliament did not intend. The higher than market hourly rate charged by ASDL was also considered to be an unusual feature of the agreement. The high rate had the effect of artificially increasing the amount of the invoices and the subsequent GST refund that could be claimed.

#### The fact that the Taxpayer had no independent source of funds

The Taxpayer had no independent source of funds other than through the receipt of the GST refunds. While this was on its own not considered to be sufficient to bring the arrangement within the ambit of section 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, in combination with all the other factors noted above it did assume some significance for the Court.

#### Section 19D of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

Counsel for the Taxpayer argued that section 19D of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 evidenced Parliament's intention to mark out specific thresholds of time and value which it considered to be acceptable and unacceptable in relation to timing mismatches and the risk to the revenue. The Court rejected that contention.

High Court functus officio
==========================

2012 case note - confirms that to set aside a judgment on the basis that it was obtained by fraud requires actual fraud in the strict legal sense.

Case

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court held that the plaintiffs did not allege fraud so as to engage the jurisdiction of the Court to set aside its judgment of 20 December 2004. Furthermore, the judgment of 20 December 2004 was not a nullity. Accordingly, the High Court was functus officio.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that to set aside a judgment on the basis that it was obtained by fraud requires actual fraud (in the strict legal sense) being something in the nature of the deliberate presentation of false evidence, the deliberate suppression of a material fact(s) or the falsification of documents. The decision also confirms that where an unsealed judgment has been the subject of an appeal there is no jurisdiction for the trial Court to recall its judgment on the basis that counsel had failed to direct the Court's attention to a legislative provision or authoritative decision.

### Facts

On 20 December 2004, the High Court held that the Trinity scheme was created for the purpose of tax avoidance. That finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

The plaintiffs sought to set aside the judgment of 20 December 2004 on the basis that the Commissioner presented a false case and in the alternative, that the judgment was a nullity.

The Commissioner entered a protest to the High Court's jurisdiction and applied to dismiss the proceedings.

### Decision

His Honour, Justice Venning said that the starting point in litigation is the principle of finality and related to that principle is the principle that the trial Court is functus officio once its decision has been finally recorded or overtaken by the processes in superior courts. There are exceptions to the principle of finality, however, Justice Venning held that the Court's inherent power to set aside a judgment will only be invoked in exceptional circumstances to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

Fraud is a genuine, albeit limited, exception to the important principle of finality of litigation. However, Justice Venning did not consider that exceptional circumstances had been raised on the plaintiffs' pleadings and that the plaintiffs' case was in the nature of an allegation of an error of law being made, not fraud. His Honour said that unlike evidence, the applicability of a statutory provision cannot, by definition, be concealed or suppressed. In any event, Justice Venning held that it could hardly be suggested that a false case was put forward by the Commissioner.

Justice Venning held that actual fraud in a strict legal sense is required if a judgment of the High Court (that has been taken through two levels of appeal) is to be set aside. He said that to set aside a judgment on the basis that it was obtained by fraud requires something in the nature of the deliberate presentation of false evidence, the deliberate suppression of a material fact(s) or the falsification of documents.

The plaintiffs advanced the argument that the judgment of 20 December 2004 was a nullity as it was made without jurisdiction. The plaintiffs submitted that by failing to apply section EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 to the assessment of the licence premium, the Commissioner did not comply with statutory requirements and accordingly, the assessments, the challenge proceedings and consequently the judgment were all nullities. Justice Venning rejected the plaintiffs' argument relying on section 138P of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which gave the Court jurisdiction to determine whether the Commissioner's assessment of the plaintiffs for tax under section EG of the Income Tax Act 1994 (and other relevant provisions) was valid or not; and the principle that the Commissioner's assessment, has de facto operation unless and until it is declared a nullity by a competent court: _Love v Porirua City Council_ \[1984\] NZLR 308 at 310. Justice Venning held that if the High Court was wrong not to cancel the assessment, then that was an error to law to be addressed on appeal.

Justice Venning held that there was no jurisdiction for the High Court to declare its earlier decision a nullity as it is functus officio, given the appeals taken from that decision. If the plaintiffs were right and the process had been flawed because at law there was no valid assessment and therefore no valid decisions, then the Supreme Court (as the last superior Court to have dealt with the matter) was the proper Court to determine the issue.

High Court grants Commissioner's application for transfer
=========================================================

2015 case note – CIR's application for transfer to the High Court granted - Section 138N(2), transfer, s 330, complexity, likelihood of appeal, s 108, vendetta.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Great North Motor Company Limited (In Receivership) \[2015\] NZHC 1645

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court granted the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") application, made pursuant to s 138N of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"), to transfer the challenge proceeding filed by Great North Motor Company Limited (In rec) ("Great North") in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") to the High Court.

### Facts

The Commissioner applied to transfer the substantive proceedings, currently before the TRA, to the High Court and also applied to bring this application by way of originating application. The respondent, Great North, opposed the Commissioner's transfer application but did not oppose the Commissioner's application being brought by way of originating application.

John George Russell is the sole director and receiver of Great North. Great North's shareholdings are held by two separate companies, Glen Eden Holdings Ltd ("Glen Eden") and Downsview Nominees Ltd ("Downsview").

On 20 August 1993, Great North issued a debenture to Glen Eden ("the Debenture"). Glen Eden held the Debenture as nominee for Downsview. The terms of the Debenture provided that the principal sum would be repaid on demand and with interest. Great North has made no actual interest or principal payments on the Debenture but has claimed annual income tax deductions for the interest payable.

On 25 May 2005, Glen Eden assigned the Debenture to Kensington Developments Ltd. The Commissioner now calculates the amount owing on the Debenture to be nearly $22 million. It appears that no steps have been made to recover the amount owing.

The Commissioner reassessed the returns filed by Mr Russell on behalf of Great North. The primary issue in the substantive proceeding is whether Great North has entered into an arrangement that has the purpose or effect of tax avoidance.

### Decision

The Court was satisfied that this was an appropriate case for transfer to the High Court.

#### _Leave to commence proceeding by way of originating application_

The High Court noted there are numerous High Court cases that have confirmed that an originating application under Part 19 of the High Court Rules is the appropriate way to commence proceedings under s 138N(2) of the TAA. The Court also noted that Great North did not oppose the application.

Accordingly, the Court granted leave for the Commissioner to commence this proceeding by way of originating application.

#### _Transfer of proceeding to the High Court under s 138N(2) of the TAA_

The High Court noted that the courts have been left to establish a number of principles relevant to considering when a transfer application should be granted. These principles were recently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in _Kensington Developments Ltd (in rec) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2015\] NZCA 60 ("_Kensington_").

The Commissioner gave submissions on the following factors in support of her application for transfer:

1.  complexity of the arrangement;
2.  importance of the proceeding from the Commissioner's perspective;
3.  likelihood of appeal;
4.  amount of money at stake;
5.  vendetta allegations;
6.  any advantages to Great North from the proceeding remaining in the TRA.

#### _Complexity of the arrangement_

The High Court found that for some of the factors raised by the Commissioner, the substantive proceeding will involve some complexity.

The Court noted the Court of Appeal's finding in _Kensington_ that "the moderate complexity weighed in favour of transfer to the High Court but could not on its own be decisive" \[29\]. Accordingly, the High Court considered the other factors identified by the Commissioner.

#### _Importance of the proceeding from the Commissioner's perspective_

The Commissioner treated the tax returns for the 1996–2005 period as a nullity because during that period Great North had been taken off the company register and did not exist. Great North argues that pursuant to s 330(2) of the Companies Act 1993, the returns are not nullities and that the Commissioner cannot make assessments to re-assess the losses that were claimed because she is out of time under s 108 of the TAA.

Counsel for Great North relied upon the Supreme Court's decision in _Clark v Libra Developments Ltd_ (\[2007\] NZSC 16, \[2007\] 2 NZLR 709) ("_Clark_"), submitting that s 330(2) of the Companies Act plainly validates the returns. The High Court noted that it was not clear that _Clark_ was decisive of the interplay between s 108 of the TAA and s 330(2) of the Companies Act. The Court noted that a decision that _Clark_ has the effect argued by Great North in this case would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the Commissioner deals with companies that have been struck off the register. Accordingly, the Court found that this factor favours transfer of the proceeding to the High Court.

#### _Likelihood of appeal_

The High Court noted that given the importance of the case to the Commissioner and Mr Russell's litigation history, it is almost certain that the decision will be appealed by the unsuccessful party. The Court found that this factor favours transfer.

#### _Amount of money at stake_

The High Court agreed that the $21,717,813.79 at stake in the proceeding goes to the significance that the parties attach to the proceeding and the likelihood of appeal. Accordingly, the Court found that this factor favours transfer.

#### _Vendetta allegations_

The Court considered that the nature of the allegations on behalf of the taxpayer weighs strongly in favour of transfer to the High Court.

#### _Advantages to Great North of the proceeding remaining in the TRA_

Great North submitted that the confidentiality of the TRA combined with its ability to receive evidence not admissible in a court of law and costs savings were factors that must be given more weight than the factors outlined by the Commissioner in support of her transfer application. The Court found Great North's considerations unpersuasive and supported the Commissioner's submissions on these points.

High Court grants Commissioner's application to transfer a challenge filed in the Taxation Review Authority to the High Court
=============================================================================================================================

2013 case note – CIR's application to transfer a challenge filed in the Taxation Review Authority to the High Court granted.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Kensington Developments Limited \[2013\] NZHC 3537

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This case concerns an application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") for an order transferring a challenge proceeding filed by the taxpayer in the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") to the High Court under section 138N(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The High Court granted the Commissioner's application, and made an order for transfer.

### Facts

This decision involved an application made by the Commissioner seeking orders to transfer challenge proceedings (_Kensington Developments Ltd (in receivership) v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (TRA 28/11)) filed by the respondent, Kensington Developments Limited ("Kensington"), in the TRA to the High Court. The Court granted the Commissioner's application, and made an order for transfer.

The application was made in reliance on section 138N(2) of the TAA, which provides that the Commissioner "… may apply to the High Court to have the challenge transferred to the High Court". Although there is no stipulated procedure to follow in making such an application, the Court acknowledged that making an originating application under Part 19 of the High Court Rules was appropriate.

### Decision

#### **Is the dispute of sufficient complexity to warrant transfer?**

In finding that the challenge was moderately complex, Allan J rejected Kensington's submissions that no actual tax had been avoided and the losses had not been offset against any income. His Honour observed that nevertheless the losses remain available for offset, and that tax loss companies can have considerable commercial value. Further, Allan J admitted the Commissioner's submission that Mr Russell's actions as a receiver is relevant "… as part and parcel of its determination of commerciality issues" (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Kensington Developments Limited_ \[2013\] NZHC 3354 (at \[30\]) and formed part of the overall picture.

The Court found that the tax value involved was moderately high when compared to other cases in which tax of hundreds of millions of dollars is in issue. However, the Court noted that the amount of tax in this case is by no means negligible. Although not determinative, on balance, the factors considered here favoured a transfer to the High Court.

#### **Precedential value**

The Court considered the Commissioner's submission that issues raised in this dispute are identical to those in other disputes and under active investigation by Inland Revenue; having already arisen in respect to some assessments and being likely to arise in the future. Allan J concluded that any judgment in the present case will likely serve as a precedent for a number of other cases, identifying that the tax treatment of substantial claimed losses would be affected.

#### **Likelihood of appeal**

Mr Judd, counsel for Kensington, submitted that it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to assume an appeal is likely, in that "… it may be an abuse of process …" (at \[63\]) for any party to decide an appeal against an adverse decision was likely prior to that decision being made.

The Court upheld the decision in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Deepsea Seafoods (No 1) Ltd_, (2004) 21 NZTC 18,469 (HC)), stating that it is well established that the likelihood of an appeal from a first instance decision is a highly relevant factor to the determination of an application under section 138N(2). The Court considered (a) the large sum involved, (b) the precedential value the decision would carry and (c) Mr Russell's tendency to exercise his rights of appeal as factors leading to a high prospect of an appeal occurring.

#### **Vendetta allegations**

Mr Judd urged the Court not to make too much of Kensington's complaints about the behaviour of the Commissioner and her staff in the challenge proceeding before the TRA. Mr Judd relied on the fact that Mr Russell had been making such allegations in proceedings for many years without it having any discernible impact on the TRA's ability to adjudicate the matter. Alan J said that Mr Judd was in effect suggesting "Mr Russell's bark is worse than his bite" (at \[72\]).

The allegations made in Kensington's notice of claim raised administrative law issues that could not be overlooked. The Court noted that if Kensington had wished to reduce the likelihood of a transfer to the High Court it should have "… framed its points of claim in a less strident fashion" (at \[73\]).

#### **Other factors considered**

Kensington raised an earlier unsuccessful application to transfer a proceeding in which Mr Russell was involved (_JM Webster Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_, HC Auckland M1052/96, 3 August 2004), despite vendetta allegations being raised. Allan J concluded that the application was unsuccessful in that case because the TRA at that time, Judge Barber, had extensive knowledge of the Russell template and so the High Court concluded that he was best placed to hear the matter. As Kensington is not a Russell template case, and Barber is no longer a TRA judge, those grounds did not apply here.

His Honour also confirmed in response to Kensington's submission that section 6 of the TAA should be accorded primacy in considering the transfer application, that section 6 did not create rights enforceable by the taxpayer.

In rejecting Kensington's submissions on section 27 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, Justice Allan concluded that there was nothing to suggest Mr Russell was being discriminated against by the Commissioner in her making this application.

Allan J admitted that the convenience (informality, confidentiality) and cost advantages (lay representation, no costs award) of the TRA were relevant, but concluded they were not determinative.

Finally, the Court found that the Commissioner's delay in making the application (18 months after the challenge commenced) was a neutral factor as Kensington did not claim it had been prejudiced by the delay, and delay itself had not been considered relevant in previous transfer applications.

#### **Conclusion**

Considering these four factors collectively, the Court was persuaded to order the transfer of the proceeding to the High Court.

High Court grants interim relief under section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972
=====================================================================================

2014 case note - Court granted interim relief to taxpayer prohibiting CIR from commencing bankruptcy proceedings until judicial review application determined.

Case

Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The applicant, Mr John George Russell ("Mr Russell") filed a judicial review application against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") in relation to her decision not to accept his proposed offers of settlement. The Commissioner obtained summary judgment against Mr Russell for approximately $367 million. Mr Russell sought interim relief under section 8 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 ("JAA"). The Court granted interim relief to Mr Russell making an order prohibiting the Commissioner from commencing bankruptcy proceedings until the Commissioner's application to strike out the judicial review proceeding is determined.

### Introduction

This decision concerns an application made by Mr Russell for interim relief under section 8 of the JAA. Specifically, Mr Russell sought an interim order to prevent the Commissioner from taking steps to have him adjudicated bankrupt on the grounds that the order is necessary to preserve his position and is in the interest of justice.

### Facts

In January 2003, the Commissioner assessed Mr Russell, for taxation in the years 1985 Income Tax Act 2004, Tax Administration Act 1994 to 2000, having determined that he was a party to, and affected by, arrangements said to constitute tax avoidance. These assessments were confirmed in the Taxation Review Authority and on appeal.

Mr Russell's appeals to the High Court and Court of Appeal were dismissed. On 13 August 2012, the Supreme Court dismissed Mr Russell's application for leave to appeal to that Court.

As Mr Russell has exhausted all avenues of challenge to the assessments, the Commissioner began enforcement action against him. On 10 June 2014, Associate Judge Doogue granted summary judgment against Mr Russell in favour of the Commissioner for unpaid tax, interest, and penalties totalling $367,204,207.41.

Before the application for summary judgment was heard, Mr Russell filed proceedings seeking judicial review that relates to the Commissioner's refusal to accept Mr Russell's offers to settle his tax liability and under which he alleges that the Commissioner's decision to reject his instalment proposals were not made fairly, reasonably, or in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

The Commissioner has applied to strike out the judicial review proceedings. The application has not yet been set down for hearing.

Mr Russell then applied for interim relief under the JAA.

### Decision

The Court made an interim order prohibiting the Commissioner from commencing bankruptcy proceedings against Mr Russell, pending further order from the Court. Her Honour held that the order is to last only until the Commissioner's application to strike out the judicial review proceeding is determined. The Court reserved her decision on costs, pending further order of the Court.

#### _Jurisdiction to make interim orders_

Andrews J began her analysis by considering the legislation and case law relevant to the application of section 8 of the JAA. Her Honour referred to the approach taken in _Carlton & United Breweries Limited v Minister of Customs_ \[1986\] 1 NZLR 423 (CA) ("_Carlton_") and noted the differences of approach as to the place for consideration of the merits of the applicant's case for judicial review.

Her Honour mentioned the case of _Safe Water Alternative New Zealand Incorporated v Hamilton City Council_ \[2014\] NZHC 1463 ("_Safe Water")_ in which Kos J described the _Carlton_ approach as a two-stage enquiry of first determining whether it is necessary to grant interim relief to preserve the applicant's position, then considering whether it is appropriate to grant the relief sought. The Court in _Safe Water_ described a three-stage approach, with a new first stage of considering whether there is a "real contest" between the parties.

Then her Honour referred to _International Heliparts NZ Ltd v Director of Civil Aviation_ \[1997\] 1 NZLR 230 (HC) where it was considered that the test is simply whether interim orders are necessary to preserve the applicant's position.

Andrews J preferred not to adopt the three-stage test described in _Safe Water_ as her Honour considered that it is not consistent with _Carlton_ and appears to require consideration of the merits of the applicant's case twice; first to decide if there is a "real contest", and second to decide whether to exercise the discretion to grant interim relief.

Her Honour also noted the approach taken by Whata J in _Hampton v Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority_ \[2012\] NZRMA 139, where the Court first determined whether an order was necessary to preserve the applicant's position and then considered the apparent strengths and weaknesses of the applicant's case.

#### _Is an interim order necessary to preserve the applicant's position?_

Andrews J accepted the submission made by Mr Russell's counsel, that the position that the applicant sought to preserve was "the legal status of not being bankrupt". This was in opposition to the submission made on behalf of the Commissioner that the "position" was the ability for Mr Russell to pursue the judicial review application.

Her Honour went on to find that an interim order was reasonably necessary to preserve Mr Russell's position of not being bankrupt, as the Commissioner has a judgment against him and in the absence of an interim order preventing her from doing so, can and will pursue bankruptcy proceedings.

#### _Should an interim order be made?_

Andrews J considered that the issue of whether to grant the interim order was far more difficult, and requires consideration, among other things, of the application for judicial review.

In regard to Mr Russell's case for judicial review, her Honour concluded that as the Commissioner's application to strike out Mr Russell's judicial review application had not yet been heard, it was not appropriate to comment in any detail on the strength or weakness of Mr Russell's case. However, her Honour could not conclude that Mr Russell's case is so hopeless that his application for an interim order should be dismissed before the application to strike out, where the strength of the case is focused on and is heard.

#### _Remaining discretionary factors_

Andrews J did not accept the counsel for the Commissioner's submission that a factor counting against a stay is that judicial review proceedings could be pursued by the Official Assignee if Mr Russell was bankrupted. Her Honour considered this submission speculative and noted that there was no evidence that the Official Assignee would pursue the proceeding. Her Honour agreed with Mr Russell's counsel that the nature of the judicial review proceeding is such that the Official Assignee would be unlikely to see any benefit in pursuing it. Her Honour considered that the interest in pursuing it lies with Mr Russell, not the administrator of his estate.

In regards to the "delay", Andrews J recognised that Mr Russell's case is a tax dispute with a very long history. Her Honour accepted that delay cannot be determinative to conclude that a stay should not be granted. Her Honour also accepted that the extremely long time it has already taken to determine tax issues between the Commissioner and Mr Russell is prejudicial to the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the tax system, and to the Commissioner carrying out her duties to administer the tax laws. Accordingly, her Honour noted that if there is further delay as a result of a stay of the bankruptcy proceedings, it should be for as short a time as possible.

Case

Edwards v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1795

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 108, 138E, 138P and 141E

### Summary

This is an appeal to the High Court against the Taxation Review Authority's ("TRA") finding that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was correct to hold the opinion that the appellants' tax returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading pursuant to s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA"). The Commissioner cross-appealed the TRA's finding that the appellants had not committed evasion.

The High Court held that the TRA was wrong to restrict her reconsideration of the Commissioner's time bar ruling to whether the Commissioner's opinion was honestly held and reasonably available on the evidence. Williams J concluded that the TRA ought to have reviewed the ruling de novo.

Williams J dismissed the Commissioner's cross-appeal because Williams J considered that the TRA was right to come to the conclusion that the Commissioner had not proved Mr Edwards was dishonest as that conclusion was very much open to her on the evidence.

### Impact

This decision confirms the approach taken in _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Legarth_ \[1969\] NZLR 137 (CA) ("_Legarth_")_._ The TRA stands in the Commissioner's shoes in all respects when considering a challenge in relation to the opinion formed under s 108(2) of the TAA and can come to its own opinion as if it is the Commissioner. 

### Facts

In April and May 2014, the Commissioner reassessed the appellants' income tax for the tax years 2004-2008. She found they had made impermissible deductions from declared incomes in those years, which were for premiums paid by way of promissory notes to a "captive insurance company" they planned to establish. 

The Commissioner re-opened the time bar in accordance with s 108(2) of the TAA because the appellants' tax returns were either fraudulent or wilfully misleading.  The Commissioner also imposed on the appellants evasion shortfall penalties in accordance with s 141E of the TAA or, alternatively, gross carelessness shortfall penalties in accordance with s 141C of the TAA. 

The appellants challenged the Commissioner's decision to re-open the time bar, as well as the imposition of the shortfall penalties. On 8 June 2015 the TRA upheld the Commissioner's decision to re-open the time bar and to impose a gross carelessness penalty on the appellants (_Case 9/2015_ \[2015\] NZTRA 09, (2015) 27 NZTC 3-008). The TRA considered the Commissioner had not established evasion.  

The appellants appealed to the High Court against the TRA's finding on time bar. The Commissioner cross-appealed the TRA's finding on evasion. 

### Decision

_The standard for re-opening the time bar in s 108(2) of the TAA_

On appeal, Mr Lennard submitted that the TRA was wrong to refuse to review the Commissioner's time bar ruling on a de novo merits basis. Mr Lennard submitted that the leading authority (plus binding on the High Court) for his proposition is _Legarth_ where the Court of Appeal held that the Taxation Review Board ("the Board") was required to review substantively the opinion of the Commissioner even though s 24 of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (equivalent to s 108(2) of the TAA) was subjectively worded. 

The Commissioner submitted that the TRA had applied the correct review standard.  The taxpayer must show that the Commissioner's opinion was not honestly held, that she had applied a wrong legal test or that the opinion was simply not reasonably open to her on the evidence. The Commissioner submitted that _Legarth_ no longer controlled the review standard in challenges to time bar decisions in light of changes to the legislation and subsequent Court of Appeal authorities such as _Auckland Institute of Studies Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2012) 20 NZTC 17,685 (HC) and _Wire Supplies Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 244, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 458_._  

Williams J considered that _Legarth_ was clearly right in terms of the construction of s 24(2) and s 18(2), and that the intention of the legislature must have been that whatever decision-making authority vested in the Commissioner also vested in the Board when an objection was lodged. The combined effect of s 108(2) of the TAA and s 16(2) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 ("the TRAA") is accordingly the same as s 24(2) and s 18(2) in _Legarth._ 

The Commissioner also relied on the effect of s 138P of the TAA. Williams J considered that s 138P could not be said to impliedly repeal s 16(2) of the TRAA.  The wording of s 138P does not negate the effect of s 16(2), but simply adds a "procedural twist". The TRA could no longer be said to have the direct powers of the Commissioner, but it may direct the Commissioner as if it did have such powers and the Commissioner must comply. 

Williams J held that the TRA was therefore wrong to restrict her reconsideration of the Commissioner's time bar finding to whether the Commissioner's opinion was honestly held and reasonably available on the evidence. Instead the TRA ought to have reviewed the ruling de novo. 

_Correct test for "evasion or similar act" in s 141E of the TAA_

Williams J considered that the TRA was well aware of the correct test for subjective recklessness, as well as the inferences that the Commissioner invited the TRA to draw.

Mr Edwards and Ms Patterson's view that the deductions were claimable were not directly challenged by the Commissioner in cross-examination, which would have been good practise. However, Williams J was not prepared to find the Commissioner was under an obligation to do so in terms of s 92 of the Evidence Act 2006, but did consider that the failure to test this issue with either witness inevitably made the argument that the TRA's conclusion was irrational more difficult to sustain. 

Relying on _Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v Bairstow_ \[1956\] AC 14 (HL) and _Faryna v Chorny_ \[1952\] 2 DLR 354 (BCCA)_,_ the Commissioner argued that the preponderance of the evidence so irresistibly pointed to Mr Edwards' knowledge of the risk that the deductions were unlawful, that the failure to directly attack his honest belief through cross-examination ought not to prevent Williams J from rejecting the TRA's finding. The High Court disagreed.   

Williams J considered that the TRA was right to come to the conclusion that the Commissioner had not proved Mr Edwards was dishonest as that conclusion was very much open to her on the evidence. Without having had the same advantage, Williams J did not feel that he was in any better position to assess credibility than the TRA was. In light of this, Williams J was not prepared to overturn the TRA's findings so the Commissioner's cross-appeal was dismissed.

Case

Muir v The Taxation Review Authority & Anor \[2017\] NZHC 2932

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972; Judicial Review Procedure Act 2016

### Summary

The Applicant ("Dr Muir") brought proceedings in the High Court seeking to judicially review the Taxation Review Authority's ("TRA") refusal to accept for filing his "Second Amended Notice of Claim". This proceeding concerned the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") application to dismiss Dr Muir's judicial review application.

### Impact

This decision confirms that where a tax challenge has been struck out in its entirety, there is no jurisdiction to judicially review a refusal to accept an amended notice of claim for filing in the struck out challenge.

### Facts

The background to the proceeding involves the Trinity tax scheme designed by Dr Muir. The High Court determined that the dominant purpose of the scheme was tax avoidance (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 (HC)), which decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (_Accent Management Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 230) and Supreme Court (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115).

Dr Muir's challenges to the 1997 to 2010 income years, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the Supreme Court's decision, were subsequently struck out in the TRA and High Court. This was affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeal (_Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2015\] NZCA 792) and by the Supreme Court (_Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2016\] NZSC 113) which determined that Dr Muir's proceedings remained struck out in their entirety. Dr Muir then tendered 'amended statements of claim' in the TRA and the High Court. The TRA refused to accept the amended pleading for filing while the High Court inadvertently accepted the amended pleading for filing.

The High Court, in separate proceedings on the inadvertent acceptance for filing, had declared the tendering of the amended statement of claim in High Court was an abuse of process and a nullity, directing that the document be removed from the file (_Muir and Hillvale Holdings Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 2082). Dr Muir brought these proceedings seeking to judicially review the TRA's refusal to accept the amended pleading for filing and the Commissioner applied for these proceedings to be dismissed.

### Decision

The High Court was satisfied it did not have jurisdiction to review the TRA's refusal to accept Dr Muir's "Second Amended Notice of Claim" for filing and dismissed the application pursuant to r 5.49(6)(a) of the High Court Rules.

The Court found, citing the earlier High Court decisions (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Muir_ \[2017\] NZHC 1413, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-029 at \[44\] and _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2017\] NZHC 2082, (2017) 28 NZTC 23-029 at \[12\]), that as the proceeding in the TRA is at an end, there is nothing in which any 'amended' pleading may be filed. As the TRA did not exercise any power in refusing to accept such a pleading for filing, the High Court was satisfied that it did not have jurisdiction to review such a refusal.

Given the Court's finding, it did not need to decide the Commissioner's alternative application to strike out the judicial review as an abuse of process. However, the Court noted that had it been required to, it would have granted it.

The Court's preliminary view was the Commissioner should be entitled to 2B costs for all steps before 23 June 2017 and indemnity costs from 23 June 2017 when summary judgment was ordered against Dr Muir (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Muir_ \[2017\] NZHC 1413) but reserved leave for memoranda on costs to be filed if required.

High Court strikes out judicial review, finding it to be an abuse of process
============================================================================

2015 case note - High Court struck out an application for judicial review of the CIR's decision declining payment proposals - abuse of process, maximum recovery.

Case

John George Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972

### Summary

The High Court struck out John George Russell's ("Mr Russell") application for judicial review of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") decision declining his payment proposals.

### Facts

Mr Russell has been assessed to owe tax of $5,692,665.90 for the period 31 March 1985 to 31 March 2000 (inclusive). That amount owed has greatly increased through the application of penalties and interest. He has had summary judgment entered against him in the amount of $367,204,207.41 plus costs and disbursements.

Mr Russell has made two instalment payment proposals and a lump sum proposal.

On 27 September 2006 at a judicial settlement conference, Mr Russell proposed to make instalment payments towards the assessments of $1,000 per week. The Commissioner refused this proposal.

On 9 December 2012, Mr Russell again proposed to pay tax debt by instalments of $1,000 per week for the rest of his life or until bankruptcy or mental incapacity. This was declined on 26 August 2013.

Mr Russell made an alternative offer on 2 September 2013 to pay a lump sum of $150,000, which he could borrow against further income on the basis that the balance would be remitted. This was declined on 13 September 2013.

Mr Russell filed judicial review proceedings on 23 May 2014, seeking declarations that the Commissioner's decisions declining his proposals were invalid, and an injunction preventing the Commissioner from taking any further steps to recover the debt.

The reasons for declining the 9 December 2012 proposal were set out in an internal memorandum of 10 July 2013. The offer proposed by Mr Russell was not considered to be a realistic offer as:

*   the Commissioner was unable to write off any portion of the debt owed;
*   there was no certainty or finality for either party;
*   Mr Russell's financial affairs were complex, allowing him to accumulate wealth in trusts while declaring little personal income, and so further investigation of these structures and gifts made to the trusts by Mr Russell was required;
*   Mr Russell had a poor history of compliance; and the proposal would be an inefficient use of resources given the debt would grow faster than the payments made.

The Commissioner's letters of 26 August 2013 and 13 September 2013 to Mr Russell were consistent with these reasons.

### Decision

The application for judicial review is struck out.

#### _Inconsistency with achieving highest net revenue_

The Court held that the Commissioner could conclude it was consistent with achieving the highest net revenue if a specific offer was so small it would be better for the collection of revenue generally to reject it, even if it might offer the best possible commercial return.

#### _An instalment arrangement would maximise recovery and was consistent with duty to recover the maximum outstanding tax_

Mr Russell claimed that the Commissioner failed to comply with the duty to maximise recovery of the outstanding tax in s 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

The Court found the Commissioner specifically referred to and set out in full s 177B in her memorandum. Further, the decision that there was too much uncertainty to warrant a decision that acceptance of the offer would maximise recovery was entirely open to the Commissioner in these circumstances. Pushing execution may produce a better result, and the Commissioner had a duty to consider broader issues of the overall integrity of the tax system.

#### _Costs of continuing to litigation an inefficient use of resources_

Mr Russell essentially argued the grounds set out in s 177B(2) of the TAA for the Commissioner declining to enter into an instalment arrangement were not made out.

Asher J held s 177B(2) had to be seen in the broader context of the TAA. The Commissioner could form the view that there could be some recovery, and that it could be more than was offered. There were grounds to consider that it was an efficient use of resources to proceed to execute the judgment against Mr Russell by bankruptcy proceedings or other execution. Moreover, the Commissioner was of the view that the proposals would not maximise the recovery of tax from Mr Russell, as a better return might be achieved by enforcement.

#### _Decision not reasonable or rational_

The Court found Mr Russell's complaints under this head related to the fairness of the Commissioner's decision to seek payment of the tax due, rather than her decision on the proposal. That decision cannot be assailed in the judicial review proceeding.

Asher J stated Mr Russell should have paid the tax when it was due, and can therefore fairly be required to pay the tax now.

#### _Failure to take into account the fact that it was the Commissioner's decision to assess income not received by Mr Russell and which he could not recover, as a reason he could not pay tax_

This was held to have been exhaustively litigated. Mr Russell had no further rights of challenge and could not raise the issue yet again in this judicial review proceeding.

#### _The refusal to accept the instalment proposals was motivated by the improper purpose to bankrupt the applicant and other irrelevant considerations and was a decision no rational person could have made_

There was no evidence that the decision to reject the proposal was influenced by any irrelevant or improper factors. The possible recovery if bankruptcy proceedings were brought compared to the amount recovered if Mr Russell's proposed arrangement was accepted was a relevant consideration.

#### _Disproportionally severe treatment or punishment in breach of s 9 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 ("NZBORA") and an excessive fine in breach of the Bill of Rights Act 1688_

It was held to be nonsensical to suggest that the Commissioner, in proceeding to bankrupt Mr Russell, was acting in a way that could be equated with torture or cruel and degrading treatment or punishment under s 9 of the NZBORA.

Article 1 of the Bill of Rights Act 1688 did not apply, as it was exclusively concerned with the conduct of Judges in enforcing the criminal law and extended only to judicially imposed punishments, of which this was not.

Asher J distinguished _W v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2005) 22 NZTC 19,602 (HC) and _Chesterfields Preschool Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2007) NZTC 21,125 (HC) on the basis that both were fact specific and involved errors by the Commissioner not present here.

#### _Failure to give adequate or rational reasons_

The letters provided to Mr Russell sufficiently set out why Mr Russell's proposals were rejected based on the applicable statutory framework. In regards to the judicial settlement conference, nothing more than oral reasons provided at the conference could be expected.

#### _Abuse of process_

Asher J was of the view that the judicial review proceedings were an abuse of the Court's process. There is a public interest in proceedings to enforce civil debts being allowed to proceed through the courts in a timely manner and for such proceedings not to be subjected to undue delay.

It must be in the public interest that the Commissioner is able to expeditiously carry out the duties imposed by the revenue acts including pursuing and completing enforcement action, and not be stalled by challenges to her refusal to accept minimal settlement offers.

The fact that Mr Russell waited seven years and six months before bringing a proceeding challenging the decision was indicative of an abuse of procedure. Judicial review proceedings challenging earlier decisions must be brought reasonably promptly for the judicial review application process to work efficiently and fairly. The judicial review proceedings were issued following the exhaustion by Mr Russell of his orthodox legal challenges to the Commissioner's assessment against him. The earlier delay and the pursuit now of this proceeding were held to be indicative of this proceeding being an abuse of procedure.

The attempt in the statement of claim to challenge indirectly yet again the fact that Mr Russell was assessed is a misuse of the judicial review procedure, and an indication that the proceedings as a whole are an abuse.

The judicial review proceeding was held to have no merit.

High court upholds taxation review authority decisions and strikes out challenges finding them to be an abuse of process
========================================================================================================================

2015 case note - High Court upholds TRA decisions relating to Trinity Scheme and strikes out challenges - stayed case, mutuality of interest, abuse of process.

Case

Muir & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court struck out the challenge proceedings of Dr Muir and others in relation to assessments for various tax years ranging from 1997 to 2010. The High Court also dismissed appeals against decisions of Judge Barber striking out Dr Muir's challenges for the 1998 to 2006 years and refusing to recall his strike-out decision.

### Facts

The 11 plaintiffs were investors or LAQCs of investors in the Trinity Scheme. The challenges in this proceeding had been stayed under the TAA awaiting determination of the test cases which were the Trinity challenges determined by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2008\] NZSC 115). The challenges had been consolidated with two appeals from the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA").  

With leave from the Court, the majority of the plaintiffs either discontinued their challenge proceedings or took no part in the hearing. The remaining parties were the first plaintiff, Dr Muir, the fourth plaintiff, Mr Maude, the eighth plaintiff, Hillvale Holdings Ltd, and the eleventh plaintiff, Waikato Residential Properties Ltd. Mr Maude, Hillvale Holdings Ltd and Waikato Residential Properties Ltd advised that they would take no active part in the hearing and would simply adopt the submissions made by Dr Muir.

Accordingly, the Court was considering:

1.  challenge proceedings by Dr Muir and others to the 2007 to 2010 assessments and Dr Muir's challenge to the 1997 assessment; and
2.  appeals by Dr Muir from decisions of Judge Barber in the TRA striking out Dr Muir's challenges for the 1998 to 2006 years and refusing to recall his strike-out decision.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") submitted that the challenges, while fresh challenges in the sense that they related to later or different assessments, nevertheless arose out of the Trinity Scheme and were identical to the tax challenges already determined by the Supreme Court. The challenges before the Court sought to re-litigate the legal analysis of the Trinity Scheme. However, the issue was subject to the doctrine of issue estoppel with the result that it was an abuse of process to issue the current proceedings.

The Commissioner also submitted that Dr Muir's appeals should be dismissed for the same reasons.

Dr Muir submitted that the Commissioner made incorrect tax assessments in so far as the "black letter" analysis of the Trinity Scheme was not based on the accrual rules. Dr Muir submitted that the Trinity Scheme required analysis under subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act") and not under subpart EG of the Act, which had been the basis for the Courts' analysis of the Trinity Scheme. Dr Muir submitted that the application of subpart EH is mandatory where there is a financial arrangement and that it was unlawful to fail to apply it. He contended that subpart EH required there to be a calculation of a core acquisition price in order to determine the interest to be spread, and thereby see what is left to depreciate under subpart EH.

### Decision

The Court followed the approach summarised in _Attorney-General v Prince and Gardner_ (\[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA) at 267)and adopted in _Couch v Attorney-General_ (\[2008\] NZSC 45, \[2008\] 3 NZLR 725) regarding- strikeout applications_._ This approach dictates that before the Court may strike out proceedings, the causes of action must be so clearly untenable that they cannot possibly succeed. The jurisdiction to strike out is to be used sparingly, although the fact that the application requires extensive argument does not exclude the jurisdiction.

The Court cited the summary of Fisher J in _Russell v Taxation Review Authority_ ((2000) 19 NZTC 15,924 (HC) at \[19\] and \[20\]) regarding its position on applications alleging abuse of process. In that case Fisher J held that proceedings can be dismissed in whole or in part as an abuse of the process of the Court where the cause of action pleaded could not succeed because of the existence of an issue estoppel with respect to one or more of the essential elements of the cause of action, or where the pleaded cause of action represents an attempt to litigate or re-litigate issues which ought properly to have been included in the previous proceedings.

The Commissioner's case was that Dr Muir stood to gain from the Trinity scheme because he was the architect, advisor and investor, and the guiding hand behind Redcliff Forestry Venture Ltd. The challenges and appeal were seeking to re-litigate the legal analysis of the Trinity Scheme and this was an abuse of process.

The primary basis for the strike-out application and dismissal here was that the issue sought to be raised had been finally determined by the Supreme Court in three judgments. There was a final decision as to the appropriate analysis of the Trinity Scheme and an issue estoppel because the Supreme Court had determined all matters between the plaintiffs and appellant, their privies and the Commissioner.

The Court found that there was "no basis for concluding that Dr Muir was not a privy to the parties in _Ben Nevis_" with the result that the Supreme Court judgment is binding upon him. To allow re-litigation of the issue would be an abuse of process.

The Court then went on to briefly refer to the positions of the remaining plaintiffs and found they also were clearly privies and bound by the Supreme Court judgments.

The Court concluded that that the current plaintiffs were estopped from disputing the determinations of the Supreme Court judgments as binding on them as if they were parties to those proceedings. They therefore were estopped from raising arguments concerning the treatment of the Trinity Scheme and appropriate assessments.

The Court also concluded that this was a clear case of an abuse of process which must not be allowed to continue. It may also be viewed as a collateral attack on the final decisions of the Supreme Court and is equally an abuse of process on that ground.

For the above reasons, the Court held that the Commissioner is entitled to an order striking out the challenge proceedings and also an order dismissing the appeals against the TRA decisions.

High Court upholds TRA decision regarding Income Tax, GST and PAYE assessments and TAA ss 108 and 108A time bar.
================================================================================================================

This is an appeal from a decision of the TRA regarding Mr Dowden’s challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s PAYE, GST and INC assessments for tax periods between January 2004 and May 2012.

[TIB Volume 32 No 1 February 2020](/tib/volume-32---2020/tib-vol32-no1)

Case

Dowden v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2019\] NZHC 2729

Legal terms

Fraudulent, Wilfully misleading, Knowingly

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994  
Income Tax Act 2004  
Income Tax Act 2007  
Student Loan Scheme 1992  
Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 108 and 108A

### Summary

This is an appeal from a decision of the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) regarding Mr Dowden’s challenge to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“Commissioner”) PAYE, GST and INC assessments for tax periods between January 2004 and May 2012.

These assessments concerned several businesses run by Mr Dowden, including Safeguard Security (“Safeguard”). Mr Dowden claimed to have transferred his interest in Safeguard to his former partner, Ms Jackson, in December 2003. Mr Dowden’s case was that Ms Jackson was liable for tax relating to Safeguard between January 2004 and December 2011.

The TRA upheld the Commissioner’s assessments. The TRA held that Mr Dowden had not ceased to trade as Safeguard from January 2004 to December 2011 and also that the Commissioner was not bound by the limitation periods in ss 108 and 108A of the TAA.

### Impact

The decision reaffirms the TRA’s entitlement to determine the weight to place on evidence where the witness was not available for cross-examination and that it is not required to disregard entirely, the conflicting statements of a witness. The decision also reaffirms the TRA’s entitlement to take into account all information relevant to the assessment made by the Commissioner.

The decision reaffirms case law surrounding TAA ss 108 and 108A and provides a useful summary of judicial definitions of the terms used in these sections.

### Issues

The issues for determination were: whether the TRA erred in finding that Mr Dowden had carried on business as Safeguard during the relevant period; and whether the TRA’s determinations regarding ss 108 and 108A were in error.

### Decision

Mr Dowden argued that the TRA did not accord enough weight to statements made by Ms Jackson during an interview with Inland Revenue staff, which, according to Mr Dowden, were admissions that she and/or a company she controlled had taken over Safeguard. He also argued that various documents, which the TRA considered showed that Mr Dowden was owner/operator of Safeguard, evidenced no more than an inattention to detail on Mr Dowden’s part and did not show that Mr Dowden was trading as Safeguard.

The High Court did not accept Mr Dowden’s submissions, stating that the conclusion that Mr Dowden was operating Safeguard was plainly open on the evidence and that the contemporaneous documents, including Mr Dowden’s representations, led to this conclusion.

The High Court also stated that, in deciding what weight to give Ms Jackson’s statements, the TRA was entitled to take into account that she had not given evidence and was not available for cross-examination.

Mr Dowden’s argument regarding ss 108 and 108A was that the Commissioner was statute-barred from amending assessments relating to Mr Dowden’s 2004 Income Tax return and various GST returns throughout 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009.

Section 108(2) permits the Commissioner to amend assessments for income tax outside a 4-year statute bar where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the relevant return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading or does not mention income (i.e. “omitted all mention of a gain subsequently found to be assessable income”).

Section 108A(3) permits the Commissioner to amend GST assessments outside a 4-year statute bar where the Commissioner considers that the person assessed has knowingly or fraudulently failed to disclose to the Commissioner all of the material facts necessary for determining the amount of GST payable.

The Court held that the TRA made no error regarding the application of ss 108 and 108A, in light of its factual findings that the relevant income tax return “did not reflect \[Mr Dowden’s\] true tax position, \[…\] was misleading” and omitted income, and also that Mr Dowden, knowingly or fraudulently, failed to disclose all material facts in the relevant GST returns.

The consequence of these findings was that the Commissioner was not bound by ss 108 and 108A and was entitled to increase the amounts assessed as she had done.

High Court upholds TRA’s finding that no management services were provided by Honk Land Limited to Honk Land Trust
==================================================================================================================

2016 case law – no management services provided by company to trust - deductions, management fees, services.

Case

Honk Land Trustees Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1316

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 ss BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), Tax Administration Act 1994 141B and 141D

### Summary 

The High Court dismissed Honk Land Trustees Limited's appeal. Ellis J agreed with the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") that no services were provided by Honk Land Limited ("HLL") to Honk Land Trust ("Trust").

### Impact 

This decision confirms the judgment of the TRA, and in particular the correctness of its factual finding that the management services were not actually provided by HLL to the Trust. There was no need for the High Court to consider whether or not the payment of the fee formed part of or constituted a void tax avoidance arrangement that was appropriately reconstructed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") but the High Court indicated (such indication is obiter) that it was.

### Background

This case is an appeal by Honk Land Trustees Limited ("HLT") of the TRA's decision confirming an assessment made by the Commissioner disallowing a $1,116,000 income tax deduction HLT claimed in the 2005 income year. The deduction related to a management fee that, in its capacity as the corporate trustee of the Trust, HLT had paid to a related entity, HLL.

The TRA found that the management fee was not deductible because it did not relate to any relevant services actually provided by HLL and (alternatively) that it was a contrivance designed to enable the Trust to avoid the payment of tax. The TRA also upheld the imposition of a 50% shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position. 

### Facts

The Trust was established by deed dated 27 September 2002. The settlor was Mr David Andrew Tauber, who is also a discretionary beneficiary of the Trust. Mr Tauber is, or was in 2005, the controlling mind of a number of companies and other entities that were beneficially owned by the Trust (through HLT) and which collectively comprised a wider business enterprise. HLT directly owned Honk Group Limited which, in turn, directly and indirectly owned various other companies, including HLL.  

In the 2005 tax year:

1.  the Trust earned income from commercial rentals, dividends and interest income from associated entities;
2.  two of the three Auckland commercial properties owned by the Trust were sold;
3.  HLL owned two commercial buildings in Takapuna worth $20 million with a rent roll in excess of $2 million.

The financial statements of the Trust for the 2005 year recorded management fees totalling $1,152,824 as an expense to the Trust which comprised:

1.  $1,116,000 charged by HLL; and
2.  $36,824 charged by Basin Ridge Management Ltd, Mr Tauber's management company.

The effect of the $1,116,000 management fee expense was:

1.  the Trust claimed a deduction resulting in it having no tax to pay on its income; and
2.  HLL offset the payment it received against its existing losses with the result it paid no tax on the management fee income.

### Decision

The High Court considered the fundamental question raised by the appeal was whether the management services were in fact provided by HLL to the Trust at all. If they were not, then all other grounds of appeal necessarily fail.

Management Fees

The High Court agreed with the TRA's finding that there was no record of services provided and the fee was not fixed by reference to the costs incurred but simply by reference to the Trust's total income. The High Court considered the TRA's analysis of Mr Tauber's evidence was correct, highlighting the undisputed absence of any written management agreement between the Trust and HLL or any other supporting documentation. Furthermore, various other undisputed factors collectively formed a more than adequate basis for the TRA to draw the conclusions it did. 

The High Court considered that Mr Tauber's evidence was, in a number of important ways, implausible, contradictory, vague and equivocal. The High Court cited examples from the transcript of the TRA hearing, pointing out the various inconsistencies. 

The High Court considered it was difficult not to agree with the Commissioner that, in reality, the management fee was a rather unsophisticated ex post facto contrivance designed solely to effect the transfer of the precise amount of taxable income upon which the Trust would otherwise have had to pay tax. 

The High Court found that the TRA was correct to find that no management services were provided by HLL to the Trust. As a result, the High Court did not consider it necessary to consider the legal aspects of the appeal.

Shortfall penalties

On applying shortfall penalties, the High Court considered:

1.  Whether, viewed objectively, claiming the deduction was about as likely as not to be correct and, if not;
2.  Whether the deduction was claimed with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax.

The High Court agreed with the Commissioner's view that it is obvious that no deduction can be claimed by a taxpayer for the cost of services which have not been provided to it. Therefore, HLT's tax position was not about as likely as not to be correct. 

The High Court discussed a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, referring to _Alesco New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2013\] NZCA 40, \[2013\] 2 NZLR 175), concluding, as the management services were not in fact provided to the Trust by HLL, the only purpose of the fee can have been to avoid tax by moving profits out of the Trust to HLL.

High Court varies a consent order to fund companies’ legal fees in respect of criminal proceedings, but not civil proceedings
=============================================================================================================================

2017 case note – variation of consent order to fund companies' legal fees in respect of criminal but not civil proceedings - freezing orders, legal representation.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Honk Marine Ltd and ors \[2017\] NZHC 1258

Legislative References

New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, ss 25 and 29. Evidence Act 2006, s 47

### Summary

Honk Marine Ltd and Honk Barges Ltd (“the Companies”) applied to vary a consent order which arose from ex parte freezing orders obtained by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”). The Companies applied to access a fund (of $2,081,861.71) held in the Court in order to pay its legal fees for both civil and criminal tax proceedings. The High Court (Brewer J) varied the consent order in respect of the criminal proceedings, but not the civil proceedings.

### Impact

This case provides guidance on the civil law test for varying consent orders and what will constitute a “significant change of circumstances”. The terms of the consent order expressly provided that the fund “has been preserved solely to enable payments of tax debts” and that “no other payments will be sought to be made from the Fund”. The Court accepted that the Commissioner has a proprietary interest in the fund.

### Facts

The Commissioner was prosecuting the Companies for tax evasion (criminal proceedings). The Commissioner has also required the Companies to challenge her default assessments of tax (which are based on the same allegations as underlie the criminal proceedings) by filing proceedings under Part VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (civil proceedings).

The Companies’ only asset was $2,081,861.71 (“the fund”) held in the Court pursuant to consent orders made by Lang J on 25 June 2013. The Companies applied to access the fund to pay their legal fees in both proceedings. However, the Companies’ proposed payments did not fall within the ambit of the consent orders, which clearly stated that the fund would be used solely to pay the Companies’ tax debt.

### Decision

_Legal Principles_

His Honour stated that the High Court has the inherent jurisdiction to vary or set aside a consent order if the interests of justice require it and if good grounds are established to warrant that course. “Good grounds” traditionally means “grounds that would justify setting aside a contract”.

The Court stated that this case was to be considered under the inherent jurisdiction to vary the consent orders if the circumstances are extraordinary. As part of that inquiry, the Court considered whether the Companies’ circumstances have changed unforeseeably.

The Court accepted that the Commissioner had a proprietary interest in the fund. The Court noted that the parties agreed to discharge the freezing orders for pragmatic commercial reasons that had advantages for both sides. The Companies could dispose of assets and, save for having to create the fund, could deal with them as they chose. The Commissioner had the fund created and set aside for her to draw on (with the permission of the Court) in the event of victory in the civil tax proceedings. This was not just a continuation of the interim position created by the freezing orders.

The Court stated that the consequence was that the threshold to be crossed before the Companies could access the fund to pay for legal representation was higher. Where assets are restrained by freezing orders, the Court will normally allow access to them to pay for legal representation. That was not the case for a fund created by consent orders.

The Court commented that if a claimant has a proprietary interest in restrained funds pursuant to consent orders, then the applicant’s task will be even more difficult. The outcome depends on the facts and the Court retains its inherent jurisdiction to vary consent orders. However, the context will include the agreement of the parties that created the proprietary interest. The ultimate inquiry must always address the interests of justice. Consent orders are “not easily disturbed” and the Court will regard an application to vary them “with considerable caution”.

_Civil proceedings_

The Court stated that the legal principles underpinning freezing orders and consent orders are quite different. A freezing order is a temporary order restraining a respondent from (broadly) dealing with assets against the claimed interests of the applicant.

The Court further stated that a consent order is very different. It gives the Court’s authority to an agreement between the parties. That is why the traditional scrutiny of an application for variation is through the lens of contract. It is for the parties to set down the terms of their agreement and the Court’s order gives them effect.

The Court stated that the key point was that the threshold required to be crossed before a consent order will be varied is a high one. There is a contractual underpinning to a consent order so that an applicant for a variation must show that the agreement  
should be set aside to the extent of the variation sought. The threshold is higher still when the terms of the consent order create a proprietary interest in favour of the respondent (in this case, the Commissioner). The purpose of the consent orders was to keep intact the fund against the Commissioner’s tax assessment being upheld. That there would be costs involved must have, or should have, been within the contemplation of the parties, even if the Companies expected to pay those costs from other resources. The Court held that the Companies did not cross the threshold in respect of the legal costs in the civil proceedings.

_Criminal proceedings_

The Court stated that the criminal proceedings were a significant change of circumstances. There was nothing to indicate that the consent orders were made with criminal prosecutions in contemplation.

The Court further commented that the fact that the Companies are not people does not diminish their right to defend themselves (New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, ss 25(a) and 29). The right to a fair trial generally includes the right to legal representation. If the Companies were to defend the charges, to have a fair trial, they must access the fund.

The Court noted that if the Companies are convicted of the offences then that would significantly, if not decisively, affect the civil proceedings. Section 47 of the Evidence Act 2006 provided that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, proof that a person has been convicted of a relevant offence is conclusive proof in a civil proceeding that the person committed the offence.

The Court held that the interests of justice required the Companies to have reasonable access to the fund to defend themselves against the criminal charges brought by the Commissioner.

_Result_

The Court commented that this case was an example of a rare or exceptional situation where variation of consent orders will be granted to some extent. The application for access to the fund to pay legal costs relating to the civil proceeding was denied. The application for access to the fund to pay legal costs relating to the criminal proceeding was allowed, on certain conditions.

Leave was reserved to the Companies to make further application to access the fund in the event that $100,000 is insufficient to pay costs. The Companies were on notice that if such further application is received, the Court anticipated the Commissioner being given copies of all accounts so as to be able to make submissions.
