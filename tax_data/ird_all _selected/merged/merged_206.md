Double Taxation Convention With The Republic Of Korea
-----------------------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1983/5) which is available to the public from Government Bookshops.

The Convention entered into force on 22 April 1983 with effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1981. In Korea the Convention takes effect from any taxation year beginning on or after 1 January 1981.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The Convention applies to persons who are **residents** of one or both of the Contracting States. In this context the term "persons" includes a company.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The Convention covers the following taxes imposed by the Republic of Korea:

*   the income tax;
*   the corporation tax;
*   the inhabitant tax;
*   the defence tax where it is charged by reference to the income tax or corporation tax. See paragraph 1(a) of the Protocol.

With regard to New Zealand the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax but not bonus issue tax which is excluded in paragraph 1(b) of the Protocol.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

1\. **"National" - Paragraph 2(j)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

With regard to New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person (eg, a company), partnership or association which derives its status as such under New Zealand law.

With regard to Korea the term covers any individual who is a Korean national and any legal person, partnership or association which derives its status as such under Korean law.

2\. Undefined Terms - Paragraph 4

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to resolve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country. See also paragraph 4. below.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "Resident of Korea" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "Resident of Korea". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention in respect of tax imposed on an annual assessment basis.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation or assembly project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a building site or construction or installation or assembly project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on for more than 12 months activities in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources. |

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "immovable property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 6. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 6 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and, in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10 and 12 and paragraph 5 of Article 11.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see second paragraph above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

6\. Paragraph 6: refer second paragraph above in the explanation to this Article.

7\. In terms of paragraph 2 of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (h) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   Carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).
*   the operation of vessels engaged in fishing, dredging or hauling activities on the high seas - see paragraph 3 of the Protocol.

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent from 1 April 1982. The Korean tax is reduced from a 25 percent domestic rate to 15 percent in the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividend to residents of Korea.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment owned in that State by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up to 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Korea".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State of which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Korea instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest if it is paid:

*   **to** the Government or a local authority or the central bank of a Contracting State, or
*   **to** the Export Import Bank of Korea or any institution agreed to be of a similar nature to the Export Import Bank of Korea.

In New Zealand the "central bank" is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend is excluded from the term. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividends Article.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment owned in that State by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

6\. Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

7\. Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State of which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of Korea instead of the usual 15 percent. The limitation is to be achieved by the payer deducting withholding tax of 10 percent at the time of payment of the royalties. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax assessed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6. Although all royalties and know-how payments are covered, the following should be noted:

• If a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and, if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a re. bate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

*   Payments for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific **equipment** are royalties as defined. However, due to paragraph 5 of the Protocol such payments are treated as royalties only if they are "dependent upon production sales, performance results or any other similar basis related to the utilisation of that equipment". Where this is not the case the payment is deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment owned in that State by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected.

The comments to paragraph 4 of the Dividends Article apply equally here except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments to paragraphs 6 and 7 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Korea sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law imposes tax thereon.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of residence of the enterprise.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Articles is to be taxable only in the State of which the alienator is a resident. However, in paragraph 6 of the Protocol Korea retains the possibility of applying the provisions of its laws relating to the taxation of gains from the alienation of shares, rights or corporate interests in a company the assets of which consist mainly of immovable property situated in Korea.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in the other State.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, but only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the visit (or visits) does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic shall be taxed only in the State of residence of the employee. This means that if the employee is a resident of Korea then Korea has the sole right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee and the remuneration is exempt from New Zealand tax.

4\. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, a certificate must be obtained by the person seeking exemption, from the Korean tax authorities, which certifies that that person is a resident of Korea for the purposes of Korean tax.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over the rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the enterprise.

3\. The effect of paragraph 3 is that the State in which the activities are performed will not tax the income derived there provided:

*   the visit to that State is substantially supported by the public funds of the other State, or
*   the income from the visit is derived by a non-profit making organisation whose income is neither payable to, nor is otherwise available for, the personal benefit of its proprietors, members or shareholders.

The term "substantially supported" is not defined, therefore to qualify under this provision each case is determined on the facts available. For practical purposes, in respect of visits to New Zealand it is necessary for the Korean entertainers or athletes to produce written evidence certifying that they qualify under the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 17.

In practice a certificate is also required from the Korean tax authorities to verify a qualifying non-profit making organisation.

### Article 18 - Pensions and Annuities

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of resident exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. Therefore, a pension received by a resident of New Zealand from a Korean employer in respect of past employment is subject to tax in New Zealand and exempt in Korea.

However, this rule is subject to Article 192. , wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered and social security pensions need to be paid to an individual who is both a resident and a national of the other State, for the exclusive rights of the State of residence to apply. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a pension paid by the Korean Government to a resident of New Zealand may also be taxed in Korea if the individual is not also a national of New Zealand. In this case the pension would be taxed in New Zealand as the country of residence and credit would be allowed for Korean tax paid.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines the term "annuities".

### Article 19 - Government Services

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.
    *   The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Korean Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and a national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Korean Government.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government Pensions (see explanation to Article 18 in this supplement).

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with a business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration.

Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply, ie, Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

4\. Paragraph 4 extends the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 to remuneration or pensions paid by the Bank of Korea, the Export Import Bank of Korea and the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation and also any other institute of either State performing functions of a governmental nature as agreed by the competent authorities.

### Article 20 - Students and Apprentices

1\. Paragraph 1 exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business or technical apprentice from Korea. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Korea immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Korea.

2\. Paragraph 2 applies to a visitor to New Zealand from Korea solely for the purpose of study, research or training. The paragraph exempts from New Zealand tax payments made to the Korean visitor by way of a grant, allowance or award from an arrangement for assistance programme entered into by the Government of New Zealand as well as payments from overseas for the purposes of his maintenance, education or training. Note the conditions set out in paragraph 1. above also apply.

### Article 21 - Professors and Teachers

1\. Under paragraph 1 a Korean professor or teacher is exempt from New Zealand tax on his income from carrying out teaching or research in New Zealand for a period not exceeding two years irrespective of whether he will be taxed in Korea on that income. The exemption will apply provided:

*   The is or was a resident of Korea immediately before visiting New Zealand;
*   the visit does not exceed two years;
*   the visit is solely for the purpose of teaching or research at a recognised educational institution at the invitation of the said institution.

The same rules apply conversely to a resident of New Zealand visiting Korea for the same purpose.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that for paragraph 1 to apply the research must not be undertaken for the private benefit of a specified person or persons.

### Article 22 - Other Income

This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Korea and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Korea. If the income is derived from sources in Korea it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Korean tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Korea. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

### Article 23 - Relief from Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State allows credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

1\. Paragraph 1 sets out the credit provisions in the case of Korea where credit will be allowed for New Zealand tax on income from sources in New Zealand up to the amount of the Korean tax on that income.

2\. Paragraph 2(a) sets out the credit provisions in the case of New Zealand. Paragraph 2(b) ensures that in the event of any change in the New Zealand legislation dividends derived by a New Zealand company from a Korean company would continue to be exempt from New Zealand tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 is a source rule for the purposes of the Article to facilitate the allowance of a tax credit.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides for "tax sparing" relief (notional credit) to be allowed to New Zealand residents who receive dividends, interest or royalties when Korea forgives some or all of its tax under Korean laws relating to incentives for the promotion of economic development in Korea. A certificate must be obtained by the New Zealand taxpayer from the Korean tax authorities stipulating the specific incentive provisions in Korea under which the incentive is given.

The amount of notional credit allowable is limited to the amount of Korean tax which would have been payable under Korean tax laws and cannot exceed the amount of New Zealand tax levied on the income.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These Articles are to be implemented solely through Head Office.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 27 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comment.

### Article 28 - Entry Into Force

This Article provides that the Convention will generally take effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1981 and in Korea for any taxation year beginning on or after 1 January 1981.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol, which forms an integral part of the Convention, contains additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the Convention.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides in respect of Article 2:

*   the Convention covers the defence tax imposed by Korea:
*   with regard to New Zealand the Convention does not cover the bonus issue tax.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of Article 7. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that for the purposes of Article 8 international shipping and aircraft profits includes profits from the operation of vessels engaged in fishing, dredging or hauling activities on the high seas.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides for a review of Article 10 to amend the maximum rate of tax at source on dividends should New Zealand agree to a lower rate in a subsequent convention with any other country.

5\. Under paragraph 5 payments for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific equipment are treated as royalties only if they are "dependent upon production, sales, performance, results or any other similar basis related to the utilisation of that equipment". Where this is not the case, the payment is deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.

6\. Paragraph 6 allows Korea to retain the possibility of applying the provisions of its laws relating to the taxation of gains from the alienation of shares, rights or corporate interests in a company the assets of which consist mainly of immovable property situated in Korea.

7\. Paragraph 7 refers to the possible inclusion in the Convention of a non-discrimination article should New Zealand include such an article in a convention with any other country.

Double Taxation Convention With Finland
---------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1984/190) which is available from Government Bookshops.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The Convention applies to persons who are **residents** of one or both of the Contracting States. In this context the term "persons" includes a company.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

1\. The Convention covers the following taxes imposed by Finland:

*   The state income tax;
*   The communal tax;
*   The church tax;
*   The sailors' tax;
*   The tax withheld at source from non-residents' income.

2\. With regard to New Zealand the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax, but not bonus issue tax which is excluded in paragraph 1 of the Protocol.\\

### Article 3 - General Definitions

1\. **"National": Paragraph 1(e)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person, partnership or association under the law in force in New Zealand.

In Finland the term covers any individual who is a Finnish citizen and any legal person, partnership or association under the law in force in Finland.

2\. Undefined Terms: Paragraph 4

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Fiscal Domicile

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article. Paragraph 1 also defines Finnish undivided estates which are covered by Article 22.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to solve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country. See also paragraph 4. below.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised (cf paragraph 2 of Protocol).

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "Resident of Finland" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "Resident of Finland". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a building site or construction or installation project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | The term permanent establishment includes the use of substantial equipment or machinery for more than 12 months. |

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country **where the property is situated**. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, interest and royalties which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment of the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7: refer comments above in second paragraph of explanation to this Article.

8\. In terms of paragraph 4 of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (f) - are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent. The Finnish tax is, however, reduced from a 25 percent domestic rate to 15 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of Finland.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Before 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no Convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment is 30 percent.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Finland". Under paragraph 5 of the Protocol bonus issue tax is excluded.

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Finland instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of Finland instead of the 15 percent minimum. In New Zealand the limitation is achieved by the payer of the royalties deducting 10 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax is limited to 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected.

The comments relating to paragraph 4 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a minimum final tax applies in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments to paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **real** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Finland sells at a profit real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Under paragraph 2 the Article also applies to income or gains from the alienation of shares in a company.

3\. Paragraph 3 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

5\. Paragraph 5 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Articles is to be taxable only in the State which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration from salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless attributable to a fixed base available to the taxpayer in the other State. The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes and athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods in any fiscal year (income year) which does not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days, and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State, and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Finnish tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Finland for the purposes of Finnish tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of effective management of the shipping or airline enterprise is situated. This means that if the place of effective management of the enterprise is in Finland then Finland has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Finnish tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident of New Zealand.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would, therefore, have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over, or rights to, the income thus diverted or has obtained, or will obtain, some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the enterprise.

### Article 18 - Pensions

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this Article does not cover Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered which are dealt with in Article 192. .

2\. Paragraph 2 states that social security pensions are taxable exclusively in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source, unless the recipient is a resident and a national of the other State in which case the social security pensions are taxable exclusively in the State of residence.

### Article 19 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Finnish Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Finnish Government.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that Government pensions for services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but**, if the recipient is a resident and a citizen of the other State, the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. This means that a Finnish Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in Finland and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a citizen of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in Finland.

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business trainee from Finland. Note:

*   The student or trainee must have been a resident of Finland immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or business trainee going to Finland.

### Article 21 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Finland. If the income is derived from sources in Finland it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Finnish tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Finland. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Finland and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

### Article 22 - Finnish Undivided Estates

Undivided estates in Finland are taxed as separate entities at progressive rates whilst the beneficiaries are not taxed on distributions. Under this Article Finland gives exemption or relief to the estate from tax on a New Zealand resident beneficiary's share of such estate income similar to exemption or relief provided to New Zealand residents under any of the provisions of the Convention. For example, Finland will limit its tax on a New Zealand resident beneficiary's share of interest derived from Finnish sources by the estate to the rate of 10 percent in accordance with Article 10. New Zealand will allow credit to the beneficiary for the tax so paid by the estate.

### Article 23 - Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph 1(b) is a source rule for the purposes of the Article to facilitate the allowance of a tax credit to New Zealand residents.

3\. As partnerships are subject to tax in Finland as separate entities paragraph 1(c) enables New Zealand to allow credit for a New Zealand resident's proportion of Finnish tax paid by a partnership.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no further comment.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic and Consular Officials

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic or consular officials shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 27 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comment.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the provisions of the Convention will apply as follows:

(a) In New Zealand to income assessable for an income year beginning on or after 1 April 1985;

(b) In Finland:

*   in respect of taxes withheld at source, to income derived on or after 1 January 1985;
*   in respect of other taxes on income, to taxes chargeable for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1985.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The protocol deals with those items where some further explanation is required of points not covered in the Article concerned.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides that, with regard to New Zealand, the income tax specified in Article 2 does not include the bonus issue tax.

2\. Paragraph 2 clarifies the meaning of the term "place of effective management", mentioned in Articles 3, 4, 8, 13 and 15, as it applies to a person other than an individual, eg, a company.

It is explained as being the place of the company's practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

3\. Paragraph 3 clarifies the meaning of the term "enjoyment", used in Article 6, as resulting from a right to use or occupy the real property held by the company.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of Article 7. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

5\. Paragraph 5 clarifies that the term "tax on the company's undistributed profits", referred to in Article 10, does not include New Zealand's bonus issue tax.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides for a review of the maximum rates of tax at source on dividends, interest and royalties, under Articles 10, 11 and 12 respectively of the Convention, should New Zealand agree to a lower rate in a subsequent convention with any other OECD member country.

7\. Paragraph 7 refers to the possible inclusion in the Convention of a non-discrimination article should New Zealand include such an article in a convention with any other country.

### New Zealand/Kingdom of Denmark Protocol: Addition to the Double Taxation Relief (Denmark) Order 1981

A protocol to the 1981 New Zealand/Kingdom of Denmark Double Taxation Convention was signed in Copenhagen on 12 March 1985.

The purpose of the protocol is to include a non-discrimination article to prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

Paragraph (1) establishes the principle that for taxation purposes discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. The paragraph prevents a State from imposing any more burdensome taxation or connected requirement on nationals of the other State than it imposes on its own nationals **in the same circumstances.**

Paragraph (2) is the definition of the term "national" for the purposes of the Article.

Paragraph (3) requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

Paragraph (4) is designed to end a particular form of discrimination resulting from the fact that in certain countries the deduction of interest, royalties and other disbursements, allowed without restriction when the recipient is resident, is restricted or even prohibited when he is a non-resident.

Paragraph (5) prevents discrimination against enterprises which are wholly or partly owned by residents of the other state, e.g., a New Zealand subsidiary of a Danish company. This has no practical effect in New Zealand — we do not discriminate against such enterprises.

Paragraph (6) provides that this Article shall not apply to any provision in taxation laws which:

(a) is reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes; or

(b) is in force in Denmark and New Zealand at present and any subsequent laws which have substantially similar purpose or intent.

Provided that New Zealand/Denmark does not give greater benefits to residents or citizens of third countries than to residents or citizens of Denmark/New Zealand.

Paragraph (7) ensures that New Zealand may continue to distinguish in its taxation laws between residents and non-residents, e.g., grant to New Zealand residents rebates and special exemptions which do not extend to non-residents, or impose non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid by a New Zealand company to a Danish company.

Paragraph (8) restricts the scope of the Article to those taxes covered by the Convention.

The protocol entered into force on 22 July 1985 and will have effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1986 and in the case of Denmark from 1 January 1986.

Double Taxation Relief (China) Order 1986

Double Taxation Convention With China
-------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Agreement has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1986/314) which has been distributed to district offices and is available to the public from Government Bookshops.

In reading or referring to this supplement, please **ensure that it is read in conjunction with the text of the Agreement** using the defined terms correctly where they apply. Do not read any previous DTCS's in respect of other conventions or agreements when applying this Agreement.

The Agreement came into force on 17 December 1986 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1987.

In China it takes effect in respect of income derived during the taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1987.

**NB** The agreement is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention. The notes and commentaries in the OECD booklet "Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and Capital" are therefore useful resource material in understanding the application of the Agreement. Care should be taken to identify differences in the text of the Agreement from those in the OECD Model when using those notes and commentaries as an aid in the interpretation or application of this new Agreement with China.

Part II - Notes on the Agreement Article by Article
---------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal scope

The Agreement applies to persons who are **residents** of New Zealand or China or of both States.

### Article 2 - Taxes covered

The Agreement covers the following taxes imposed by China:

*   the individual income tax;
*   the income tax concerning joint ventures with Chinese and foreign investment:
*   the income tax concerning foreign enterprises; and
*   the local income tax.

In New Zealand the Agreement covers income tax and excess retention tax.

### Article 3 - General definitions

1\. Paragraph 1 groups together various general provisions required for the interpretation of terms used in the Agreement.

"National": Paragraph 1(h)

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service and Article 24 Non-Discrimination.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person or other entity deriving its status as such from the law in force in New Zealand.

In China the term covers all individuals possessing the nationality of China and all juridical persons created or organised under the laws of China as well as any organisations without juridical personality treated for tax purposes as Juridical persons so created or organised.

2\. Paragraph 2 is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Agreement.

### Article 4 - Residence

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Agreement, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that where a company or other legal person is resident in both countries, residence will be where the place of head office of the enterprise is situated. In this context, New Zealand views the term "head office" as meaning the centre of its administrative management.

In applying the tests to dual residents, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the Agreement. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Agreement a "resident of China" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is regarded as a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Agreement, he is still regarded as being resident in New Zealand under the Income Tax Act. However, it does mean that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Agreement as a "resident of China". For example, although New Zealand royalty income derived by him is not subject to non-resident withholding tax, he is liable for New Zealand income tax on the royalty income but qualifies for the 10 percent limitation in the Agreement.

### Article 5 - Permanent establishment

The Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard, however the following points should be noted:

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming and forestry profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income derived by a resident of one State from immovable property situated in the other State may be taxed in the State where the immovable property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Agreement. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income specifically covered in other Articles of the Agreement and, in addition, to interest and royalties which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraph 4 of Article 10 paragraph 5 of Article 11 and paragraph 4 of Article 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the business profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax. For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7: refer to initial comments above on this paragraph.

8\. In terms of paragraph 1 of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(i) are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of head office of the enterprise is situated. This would normally be the place of residence. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 4 below).

Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

2\. Paragraph 2 concerns the case where the place of head office is aboard a ship. In this case tax will only be charged by the State where the home harbour of the ship is situated. It is provided that the home harbour cannot be determined, tax will be charged only in the Contracting State of which the operator of the ship is resident.

3\. Paragraph 3 extends the provisions of paragraph 1 to profits derived by an enterprise as a member of a pooling agreement or similar kind of arrangement with other enterprises.

4\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This Article enables an arm's length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of residence of the recipient.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Agreement New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under our domestic law is 30 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 deals with dividends arising from shares which are attributable to a permanent establishment. It provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or are otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kind of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Prior to 1 April 1982 these qualifications would have had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no Agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares attributable to a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

5\. The main effect of paragraph 5 is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of China".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10% of gross interest paid to residents of China instead of the usual 15%.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest arising in a Contracting State if:

*   it is derived by the government of the other State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, the Central Bank of the other state or any financial institution wholly owned by the Government of the other State:
*   it is derived by a person who is a resident of the other State in respect of debt-claims of that resident which have been financed, guaranteed or insured by the Government of the other State, a political subdivision or local authority thereof, the Central Bank of the other State or any financial institution wholly owned by the Government of that other State.

In New Zealand the "central bank" is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the Dividends Article.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid an respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kind of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base to which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is attributable.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

6\. Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan is contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest as borne by that establishment, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

7\. Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment (eg, arms-length) is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Agreement.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties arise, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of China instead of the usual 15 percent withheld. In New Zealand the limitation will be achieved by the payer of the royalties deducting withholding tax of 10 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax will be limited to 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Agreement, then the 10 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Agreement to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other state, **provided** the royalties are attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing independent personal services, a fixed base to which royalties are attributable.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a minimum final tax applies in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6 - the comments to paragraph 6 and 7 of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Gains from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of China sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with gains from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for performing independent personal services. Such gains may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of which the place of head office of the enterprise is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that gains from the alienation of any property other than that referred to in paragraphs 1-3 and arising in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence **unless** the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities; or
*   is present in the other State for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any consecutive period of twelve months;

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes, who are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods which do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days in any consecutive period of twelve months; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Regarding the 183 day test the term "consecutive period of twelve months" should be noted as the treatment effectively differs from the term "income year" which is used in other treaties.

Where the term "income year" is used for the purposes of the 183 days test each income year is looked at separately in determining the number of days present. Therefore the exemption could apply where a visit of more than 183 days straddles two income years provided the visit does not exceed 183 days in either year.

When applying the "consecutive period of twelve months" criterion it should be remembered that each day means the commencement of a period of 12 months from that particular day. Thus, although a visit may straddle two income years the exemption will not apply if the visit exceeds 183 days over a period of 12 months. For example, a Chinese resident who visits New Zealand on 1 November and departs on the following 30 June will not be exempt as he will have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a consecutive period of 12 months.

In this example, if the criterion was an "income year" instead of "consecutive period of twelve months" the visitor would be exempt as at no stage would he be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in **an income year**.

When a visitor from China undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Chinese authorities which certifies that that person is resident in China for the purposes of Chinese tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of Head Office of the shipping or aircraft enterprise is situated. This means that if the enterprise has its head office in China then China has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. The place of head office would normally be the place of residence of the enterprise.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State of residence of the company paying the fees or other similar payments to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and;
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

3\. The effect of Paragraph 3 is that the State in which the activities are performed will not tax the income derived if the entertainer or athlete is performing under an arrangement of cultural exchange between the Governments of the Contracting States.

### Article 18 - Pensions

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** of the recipient of the pension exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 19(2) wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxes exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident **and** a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a Chinese Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in China and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in China.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that social security pensions may be taxed in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

### Article 19 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual is taxable solely by that State, ie, the country of origin of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable solely in the State where the services are performed provided those services are performed:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and a national of that State; or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that State and did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of performing those services.

For example, if a Chinese Government employee is resident in New Zealand, under our domestic law, he is exempt from New Zealand tax on his government salary if he is resident here "solely for the purpose of rendering the services". However, a locally recruited employee of the Chinese Government working in New Zealand is not exempt here irrespective of his nationality if he is resident in New Zealand for a reason other than working for the Chinese Government.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government Pensions (see explanation to Article 18 in this supplement).

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with a business carried on by the State, or a local authority paying the remuneration. In that event under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for salaries and wages, Article 16 for Directors' fees, Article 17 for Artistes and Athletes and Article 18 for Pensions.

### Article 20 - Teachers and Researchers

This Article provides that a teacher or researcher of one of the Contracting States who is temporarily present in the other a Contracting State in order to teach at an educational institution will be exempt from tax on his teaching remuneration in the State visited for a period not exceeding two years from the date of his arrival

### Article 21 - Students and Trainees

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student, business apprentice or trainee from China. Note:

*   The student must have been a resident of China immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand for the purpose of his education or training.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance, study or training.
*   The converse applies to a New Zealand student, business apprentice or trainee going to China.

### Article 22 - Other Income

This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Agreement. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both China and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Agreement that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

1\. The effect of paragraphs 1 and 2 are that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in China. If the income is derived from sources in China it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Chinese tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of China. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. Paragraph 3 provides for an exception from the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 where the income is effectively connected with the activity of a permanent establishment or fixed base which a resident of a State has in the other State. The effect is that the right to tax is given to the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. However, such income must be taxed having regard to the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14.

3\. In terms of paragraph 1 of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 23 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph 3 allows New Zealand companies investing or operating in China to gain the benefits of Chinese incentive legislation by allowing a notional credit for tax which would have been paid in China but for the incentive exempting the income in full or in part from Chinese tax in terms of the specific incentive legislation referred to in paragraph 3 of the Article. However, in the case of dividends, interest and royalties the notional credit shall not exceed the limitation provided for in the Articles governing these types of income. (See paragraph 2 of the Protocol).

### Article 24 - Non-discrimination

The purpose of this Article is to prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

1\. Paragraph 1 establishes the principle that for taxation purposes discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. The paragraph prevents a State from imposing any more burdensome taxation or connected requirement on nationals of the other State than it imposes on its own nationals **in the same circumstances**.

2\. Paragraph 2 requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

3\. Paragraph 3 is designed to end a particular form of discrimination resulting from the fact that in certain countries the deduction of interest, royalties and other disbursements, allowed without restriction when the recipient is resident, is restricted or even prohibited when he is a non-resident. New Zealand does not discriminate between residents and non-residents in this area.

4\. Paragraph 4 prevents discrimination against companies the capital of which is wholly or partly owned by residents of the other State, eg, a New Zealand subsidiary of a Chinese company.

5\. Paragraph 5 ensures that each country **may distinguish between residents and non-residents**. The paragraph makes it clear that the Article does not prevent different tax treatment solely on the basis of residence.

### Article 25 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 26 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no further comment.

### Article 27 - Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Agreement, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special agreements.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

The Agreement came into force on 17 December 1986 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1987.

In China it takes effect in respect of income derived during the taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1987.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Agreement. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Agreement continues indefinitely.

Double Taxation Relief (India) Order 1986
=========================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (India) Order 1986 (SR 1986/336) from PIB vol 112 supp 16, Feb 1987.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No.16, February 1987

Double Taxation Convention With India
-------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1986/336) and is available from Government Bookshops.

The Convention came into force on 3 December 1986 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1987.

In India it takes effect for any "previous year" (as defined in the Income Tax Act 1961) beginning on or after 1 April 1987.

The term "previous year" as used in the India Income Tax Act and in the Convention, in its practical application has the same meaning and effect as "income year" In other words in the case of India the Convention will first apply to income arising on or after 1 April 1987.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The Convention applies to persons who are **residents** of New Zealand or India or of both States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

In India the Convention covers income tax including any surcharge thereon and the surtax.

In New Zealand the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

1\. Paragraph 1 groups together various general provisions required for the interpretation of terms used in the Convention.

"National": Paragraph 1(g)

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service and Article 24 Non-Discrimination.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person or other entity deriving its status as such from the law in force in New Zealand.

In India the term covers any individual possessing the nationality of India and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in India.

2\. Paragraph 2 is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Residence

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that where a company or other legal person is resident in both countries, residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this context, New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

In applying the tests to dual residents, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the Convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "resident of India" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is regarded as a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still regarded as being resident in New Zealand under the Income Tax Act. However, it does mean that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention as a "resident of India". For example, although New Zealand dividend income derived by him is not subject to non-resident withholding tax, he is liable for New Zealand income tax on the dividend income but qualifies for the 20 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

The Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard, however the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 2(j) | A building site or construction or installation or assembly project or supervisory activities in connection therewith constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 6 months; |
| Paragrapg 2(k) | An installation or structure used for the exploration or exploitation of natural resources and any activities connected therewith constitute a permanent establishment. In this context "activities" includes the activities of supply ships and supply of labour. |
| Additional items to those normally found in other Conventions are: |     |
| Paragraph 2(g) | A warehouse, in relation to a person providing storage facilities for others; |
| Paragraph 2(h) | A farm or plantation or other place where agricultural, forestry or plantation activities are carried on; |
| Paragraph 2(i) | Premises used as a sales outlet. |

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming and forestry profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income derived by a resident of one State from immovable property situated in the other State may be taxed in the State where the immovable property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 8. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 8 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income specifically covered in other Articles of the Convention and, in addition, to interest and royalties which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraph 5 of Article 11, and paragraph 5 of Articles 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other State through a permanent establishment, in which case the other State may tax:

*   the business profits of the Permanent Establishment; and
*   profits arising from sales made direct in the other State by the enterprise of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through its Permanent Establishment.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary. It also provides for the profits to be estimated on a reasonable basis where the correct amount of the profits are incapable of determination or the determination thereof presents exceptional difficulties.

3\. Paragraph 3 expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of mere purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

8\. Paragraph 8: refer to initial comments above on this Article.

### Article 8 - Air transport

1\. Under this Article profits from the operation of aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3 1(h) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees when the fees represent an occasional source of income for the enterprise engaged in the international operation of aircraft.

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from internal traffic. Further, investment income of air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Paragraph 2 extends the provisions of paragraph 1 to profits derived by an enterprise as a member of a pooling agreement or similar kind of arrangement with other enterprises.

4\. Paragraph 3 defines the term "operation of aircraft".

### Article 8A - Shipping

1\. Under paragraph 1 profits from the operation of ships in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(h) - are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. However, under paragraph 2 if the profits are derived from business conducted in the other country, ie, not the country of residence but the country of source, that other country may impose tax not exceeding 50 percent of the tax that would have been chargeable on the profits had there not been a Convention. In that event the country of residence would have to give credit for tax paid in the country of source. International shipping profits include income from:

*   Carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of Passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3 below).

Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of a shipping enterprise is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

2\. Paragraph 3 extends the Provisions of paragraph 1 to profits derived by an enterprise as a member of a pooling agreement or similar kind of arrangement with other enterprises.

3\. Paragraph 3 specifically brings within the scope of this Article profits arising from the rental of ships or from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers and ancillary equipment provided:

*   The ships, or containers are used in international traffic; and
*   Tbe enterprise receiving the Profits is in the business of operating ships in international traffic; and
*   The rental income is incidental to the profits derived from those activities.

In the case of container leasing where the conditions in subparas (a) to (c) are not met, the lease payments would come within the scope of Article 12 Royalties, ie, Payments for the use of commercial or scientific equipment.

In relation to profits from leasing ships on charter fully equipped, manned and used in international traffic, such profits come within the scope of paragraph 1 of the Article.

### Article 9 - Associated enterprises

This Article enables arm's length profits to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of residence of the recipient.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 20 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 20 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under our domestic law is 30 percent. This paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 deals with dividends arising from shares which are attributable to a permanent establishment. It provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or are otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 20 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kind of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Prior to 1 April 1982 these qualifications would have had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no Convention can extend the taxing rights applicable under the domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares attributable to a permanent establishment will be 30 percent

5\. The main effect of paragraph 5 is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of India".

### Article 11 - Interests

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the interest. This paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest if it is paid:

*   **to** the Government or a local authority of a Contracting State; or
*   **to** the Central Bank of the other Contracting State;
*   **to** the Export Import Bank of India;
*   in the case of New Zealand **to** any financial institution agreed to be of a similar nature to the Export Import Bank of India by the Competent Authorities of both Contracting States.

In New Zealand the "central bank" is the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base to which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is attributable.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

6\. Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan is contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by that establishment, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

7\. Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment (eg, arms-length) is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties and Fees for Technical Services

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties or fees for technical services is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties or fees for technical services arise, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 30 percent of the gross amount of the royalties or fees for technical services. New Zealand's tax is limited to 15 percent on gross royalties or fees for technical services paid to residents of India as this is the maximum that can be applied under section 311 of the Income Tax Act 1976. In New Zealand the limitation will be achieved by the payer of the royalties and fees for technical services to the extent that such fees represent royalties as defined in the Income Tax Act 1976 deducting withholding tax of 15 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties and fees for technical services which are subject to annual assessment the tax will be limited to 30 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Convention, then the 30 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 30 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 30 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that "fees for technical services" for the purposes of this Article does not include payments made to an employee or any individual for independent personal services mentioned in Article 14 in consideration for services of a managerial, technical or consultancy nature, including the provision of services of technical or other personnel.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source, royalties or fees for technical services are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the royalties or fees for technical services are attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties or fees for technical services from the 30 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties or fees for technical services has in the other State, for the purpose of performing independent personal services, a fixed base to which royalties or fees for technical services are attributable.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a minimum final tax applies in all other cases.

6\. Paragraphs 6 and 7 - the comments to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of India sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for performing independent personal services. Such income or gains may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable solely in the State of residence of the enterprise.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that income from the alienation of shares of the capital stock of a company where that company's assets primarily consist of immovable property may be taxed in the state where the property is situated.

5\. Paragraph 5 allows income or gains from the alienation of shares in a company other than those mentioned in paragraph 4 to be taxed in the country of residence of the company.

6\. Paragraph 6 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable solely in the State of which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent personal services

1 This Article concerns income from personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence **unless** the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities; or
*   is present in the other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any consecutive twelve month period.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2 The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes, who are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent personal services

1 Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other contracting state, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2 Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods which do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days in any consecutive twelve month period; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Regarding the 183 day test the term "consecutive twelve month period" should be noted as the treatment effectively differs from the term "income year" which is used in other treaties.

Where the term "income year" is used for the purposes of the 183 days test each income year is looked at separately in determining the number of days present. Therefore the exemption could apply where a visit of more than 183 days straddles two income years provided the visit does not exceed 183 days in either year.

When applying the "consecutive twelve month" criterion it should be remembered that each day means the commencement of a period of 12 months from that particular day. Thus, although a visit may straddle two income years the exemption will not apply if the visit exceeds 183 days over a period of 12 months. For example, an Indian resident who visits New Zealand on 1 November and departs on the following 30 June will not be exempt as he will have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a consecutive twelve month period.

In this example, if the criterion was an "income year" instead of "consecutive twelve month period" the visitor would be exempt as at no stage would he be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in **an income year**.

When a visitor from India undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Indian authorities which certifies that that person is resident in India for the purposes of Indian tax.

3 Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of India then India has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State of residence of the company paying the fees or other similar payments to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

3\. Paragraph 3 gives the sole right of taxation to the country of residence if the visit of the entertainer or athlete is supported substantially from the public funds of the other Contracting State or a political subdivision, local authority or a statutory body.

### Article 18 - Pensions and Annuities

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** of the recipient of the pension exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 19(2) wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident **and** a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that an Indian Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in India and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in India.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines the term "annuities".

### Article 19 - Government service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual is taxable solely by that State, ie, the country of origin of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable solely in the State where the services are performed provided those services are performed:
    *   by an individual who is a national of that State; or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that State and did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of performing those services.

For example, if an Indian Government employee is resident in New Zealand, under our domestic law, he is exempt from New Zealand tax on his government salary if he is resident here "solely for the purpose of rendering the services. However, a locally recruited employee of the Indian Government working in New Zealand is not exempt here irrespective of his citizenship if he is resident in New Zealand for a reason other than working for the Indian Government.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that Government pensions for services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but**, if the recipient is a resident and a national of the other State, the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. This means that an Indian Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in India and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in India (for definition of national see Article 3).

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply. If the services are performed in connection with a business carried on by the State, or one of political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration.

Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply, ie, Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Students and Apprentices

1\. Paragraph 1 exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here **from overseas** by a student or business or technical apprentice from India. Note:

*   The student must have been a resident of India immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand for the purpose of his education or training.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance, education or training.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or business or technical apprentice going to India.

2\. Paragraph 2 exempts from New Zealand tax the amount received by a student or business or technical apprentice from a grant, allowance or award made under an arrangement or assistance programme entered into by the Government of New Zealand. The conditions under which the exemption is given are similar to those set out in paragraph 1. In applying this provision refer to section 60(1) and section 61(38) of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Article 21 - Professors and Teachers

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for a professor or teacher visiting a Contracting State in order to teach at an educational institution for a period not exceeding two years will be exempt on his teaching remuneration in the country visited provided that he is taxed in his country of residence. Before granting exemption evidence is required in the form of a statement from the taxation authority that he will be subject to tax in his own country.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that for paragraph 1 to apply the research must be undertaken in the public interest and not for the private benefit of a specific person or persons.

### Article 22 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in India. If the income is derived from sources in India it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Indian tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of India. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both India and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

### Article 23 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Under the provision of paragraph 3, New Zealand will allow a notional credit for Indian tax that would have been payable on certain types of investment income but for a deduction or exemption granted under the Indian Tax law as specified.

### Article 24 - Non-discrimination

The purpose of this Article is to prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

1\. Paragraph 1 establishes the principle that for taxation purposes discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. The paragraph prevents a State from imposing any more burdensome taxation or connected requirement on nationals of the other State than it imposes on its own nationals **in the same circumstances**.

2\. Paragraph 2 requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

3\. Paragraph 3 prevents discrimination against enterprises the capital of which is wholly or partly owned by residents of the other State, eg, a New Zealand subsidiary of an Indian company.

4\. Paragraph 4 states that each country may distinguish between residents and non-residents. The paragraph makes it clear that the Article does not prevent different tax treatment solely on the basis of residence. This is the New Zealand view in any case.

5\. Paragraph 5 restricts the scope of the Article to those taxes covered by the Convention (see Article 2).

### Article 25 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 26 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no further comment.

### Article 27 - Diplomatic and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic or consular officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

The Convention came into force on 3 December 1986 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1987.

In India it takes effect for any "previous year" (as defined in the Income Tax Act 1961).

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

Double Taxation Convention With Indonesia
-----------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Agreement has been published as a schedule to an order in Council (SR 1988/15) and is available from Government Bookshops.

The Agreement came into force on 24 June 1988 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1989.

In Indonesia it takes effect in respect of income derived during the taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1989.

Part II - Notes on the Agreement Article by Article
---------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The Agreement applies to persons who are **residents** of New Zealand or Indonesia or both States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

With regard to Indonesia, the Agreement covers income tax (pajak-penghasilan).

In New Zealand, the Agreement covers income tax and excess retention tax.

### Article 3 - General Definition

1\. Paragraph 1 groups together various general provisions required for the interpretation of terms used in the Agreement .

"National": Paragraph 1(f)

The term "national" is used in Article 19 Government Service .

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in New Zealand.

In Indonesia the term covers any individual possessing the nationality of Indonesia and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the law in force in Indonesia.

2\. Paragraph 2 makes it clear that the terms "New Zealand tax" and "Indonesian tax" do not include penalties or interest imposed under the law of either state.

3\. Paragraph 3 is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Agreement.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Agreement, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that where a non-individual person is resident in both countries, residence will be decided by the competent authorities having regard to the day to day management, the place of incorporation or constitution and any other relevant factors.

In applying the tests to dual residents, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the Agreement. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Agreement a "resident of Indonesia" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is regarded as a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Agreement, he is still regarded as being resident in New Zealand under the Income Tax Act. However, it does mean that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Agreement as a "resident of Indonesia". For example, although New Zealand royalty income derived by him is subject to withholding tax, he is liable for New Zealand income tax on the royalty income but qualifies for the 15 percent limitation in the Agreement.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

The Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

**Paragraph 3(a)**

a building site, a construction, assembly or installation project or supervisory activity connected to such a project, constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than six months.

**Paragraph 3(b)**

the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel where activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) for a period or periods aggregating more than 3 months within any twelve month period.

**Protocol**

An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on for more than three months any activities in connection with the exploration or exploitation of natural resources. In this context "activities" includes the activities of supply ships and supply of labour. In applying this test where the activities of associated enterprises are connected they will be regarded as being carried on by a single enterprise.

For example, where an enterprise carries on activities for two months then transfers its activities to an associated enterprise which completes the project in say two months then both enterprises are deemed to have a permanent establishment.

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming and forestry profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income derived by a resident of one State from immovable property situated in the other State may be taxed in the State where the immovable property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 8. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of the specific types of income. In effect paragraph 8 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Agreement. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income specifically covered in other Articles of the Agreement and, in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraph 4 of Articles 10 and 12, and paragraph 5 of Article 11 and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other State through a permanent establishment, in which case the other State may tax:

*   the business profits of the Permanent Establishment; and
*   profits arising from sales made direct in the other State by the enterprise of goods or merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold through its Permanent Establishment if made with a view to avoiding taxes in the other State.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the Permanent Establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae or certain percentage of the gross profits then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts.

A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

8\. Paragraph 8: refer to initial comments above on this paragraph.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(g) are to be taxed only in the country of which the enterprise is resident. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 2 below).

Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

2\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart form this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This Article enables arm's length profits to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State or residence of the recipient.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Agreement, New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under our domestic law is 30 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 deals with dividends arising from shares which are attributable to a permanent establishment. It provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or are otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kind of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Prior to 1 April 1982 these qualifications would have had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no Agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares attributable to a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

5\. The main effect of paragraph 5 is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Indonesia".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State that the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Indonesia instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest if it is paid to the Government of the other Contracting State including a political subdivision or local authority or the central bank.

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the Dividend Article.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

This qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(See section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976).

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base to which the debt claim in respect of which the interest is paid is attributable.

6\. Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by that establishment, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

7\. Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Agreement.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties arise, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalties.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined terms as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" as defined in the Agreement then the 10 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 15 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Agreement to bring the tax down to 15 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the royalties are attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing independent personal services, a fixed base to which royalties are attributable.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural)royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a maximum final tax applies in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6 - the comments to paragraph 6 and 7 of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income or gains from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Indonesia sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for performing independent personal services. Such gains may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment of fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable solely in the State of residence of the enterprise.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable solely in the State of which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence **unless** the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   is present in the other State for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 90 days in any consecutive twelve month period; or
*   has a fixed based regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes, who are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in the other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods which do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days in any consecutive twelve month period; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Regarding the 183 day test the term "consecutive twelve month period" should be noted as the treatment effectively differs from the term "income year" which is used in other treaties.

Where the term "income year" is used for the purposes of the 183 days test each income year is looked at separately in determining the number of days present. Therefore the exemption could apply where a visit of more than 183 days straddles two income years provided the visit does not exceed 183 days in either year.

When applying the "consecutive twelve month period" criterion it should be remembered that each day means the commencement of a period of 12 months from that particular day. Thus, although a visit may straddle two income years the exemption will not apply if the visit exceeds 183 days over a period of 12 months. For example, an Indonesian resident who visits New Zealand on 1 November and departs on the following 30 June will not be exempt as he will have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a consecutive 12 month period.

In this example, if the criterion was an "income year" instead of "consecutive 12 month period" the visitor would be exempt as at no stage would he be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in **an income year**.

When a visitor from Indonesia undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Indonesian authorities which certifies that that person is resident in Indonesia for the purposes of Indonesian tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of Indonesia then Indonesia has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State of residence of the company paying the fees or other similar payments to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country or residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer; and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

3 The effect of Paragraph 3 is that the State in which the activities are performed will not tax the income derived if the entertainer or athlete is performing under a cultural agreement or arrangement supported by funds of the Government of the other Contracting State, a local authority or public institution thereofe.

### Article 18 - Pensions and Annuities

1 Paragraph 1 gives the state of **residence** exclusive rights to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 19(2) wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident and a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3). This means that an Indonesian Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in Indonesia and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in Indonesia.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that social security pensions may be taxed in the State paying the pension, ie, State of source.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "pensions" and "annuities".

### Article 19 - Government Service

1\. This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

2\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only in that State.
*   However, such remuneration shall be taxed exclusively in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a resident of that State, **and** who is also a national of that State and did not become a resident of that State solely for the purposes of rendering those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Indonesian Government for service rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand.

This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Indonesian Government.

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. In that event under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for Directors' fees, Article 17 for Artistes and Athletes and Article 18 for Pensions and Annuities.

### Article 20 - Professors and Teachers

1\. Under Paragraph 1 an Indonesian professor or teacher is exempt from New Zealand tax on his income from carrying out teaching or research in New Zealand if:

*   at the invitation of a university, college, school or other similar education institution he visits New Zealand for not more than two years;
*   he is or was a resident of Indonesia immediately before visiting New Zealand;
*   his visit is solely for the purpose of teaching or research.

The same rules apply conversely to a resident of New Zealand visiting Indonesia for the same purpose.

Before granting exemption evidence is required in the form of a statement from the taxation authority that he will be subject to tax in his own country.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that for Paragraph 1 to apply the research must be undertaken in the public interest and not for the private benefit of a specific person or persons.

### Article 21 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax, maintenance education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from Indonesia.

Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Indonesia immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand **solely** for the purpose of his education or training.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Indonesia.

### Article 22 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in other articles of the Agreement. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly mentioned. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Indonesia. If the income is derived from sources in Indonesia it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Indonesian tax is given in New Zealand should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Indonesia. Cases of conflict between two residents are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Indonesia and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Agreement that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

### Article 23 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph 3 is a source rule **for the purposes of the Article** in order to solve any dual source cases which may arise thus facilitating the allowance of a credit.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no further comment.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic and Consular Officer

The aim of the article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Agreement, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the Agreement will take effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1989 and in Indonesia for any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1989.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Agreement. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Agreement continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol deals with Article 5 "Permanent Establishment". The main points are explained earlier in this supplement under Article 5.

Double Taxation Convention With Ireland
---------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1988/189) which is available from Government Bookshops.

The Convention came into force on 26 September 1988 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1989.

In Ireland it takes effect:

*   in respect of income tax and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1989.
*   in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 January 1989.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are **residents** of New Zealand or Ireland or of both States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers the following taxes imposed by Ireland:

*   income tax;
*   corporation tax; and
*   capital gains tax.

In New Zealand the convention covers income tax and excess retention tax.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

1\. Paragraph 1 groups together various general provisions required for the interpretation of terms used in the convention.

"National": Paragraph 1(g)

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 21 Government Service and Article 25 Non-Discrimination.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen and any legal person or other entity under the law in force in New Zealand.

In Ireland the term covers any individual who is an Irish citizen and any legal person, association or other entity under the law in force in Ireland.

2\. Paragraph 2 is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Residence

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that where a company or other legal person is resident in both countries, residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this context, New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

In applying the tests to dual residents, as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3, it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "resident of Ireland" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is regarded as a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still regarded as being resident in New Zealand under the Income Tax Act. However, it does mean that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention as a "resident of Ireland". For example, although New Zealand royalty income derived by him is not subject to non-resident withholding tax, he is liable for New Zealand income tax on the royalty income but qualifies for the 10 percent limitation in the convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

The Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard, however the following points should be noted:

**_Paragraph 2(g)_**

An installation or structure used for the exploration or exploitation of natural resources constitutes a permanent establishment.

**_Paragraph 3_**

A building site or construction or installation or assembly project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 6 months.

### Article 6 - Exploration and Exploitation Activities

This Article covers activities of enterprises and individuals engaged in the offshore area particularly in relation to exploration and exploitation of natural resources.

1\. Paragraph 1 sets out the application of the Article and defines the term "specified activities" as meaning activities carried on in connection with the exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources.

2\. Paragraph 2 attributes a permanent establishment to an enterprise of a State which is carrying on specified activities in the other State. For example, if an Irish company is carrying on specified activities in New Zealand it is deemed to be carrying on business in New Zealand through a permanent establishment. New Zealand consequently has the right to tax the income, in terms of Article 9. This is the case regardless of the length of time spent in New Zealand.

3\. Paragraph 3 covers specified activities performed by an individual who provides services of a professional or independent nature. It attributes a fixed base to an individual who is a resident of one State and performs the specified activities in the other State. For example, a resident of Ireland engaged in specified activities in New Zealand is deemed to be performing the activities from a fixed base in New Zealand. Therefore, in terms of Article 16, New Zealand has the right to tax the income. Again this is the case regardless of the length of time spent in New Zealand.

4\. Paragraph 4 covers remuneration derived by a resident of one State employed in the other State in connection with specified activities. The State where the activities are performed has the right to tax the remuneration.

### Article 7 - Limitation of Relief

This Article allows the country of source to tax any income which is wholly or partly relieved from tax under the convention if it is **not** remitted to the other state. It prevents any income from being untaxed in either country.

This article is necessary from the Irish point of view as in the case of investment income, they only tax it when it is remitted to Ireland.

### Article 8 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming and forestry profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income derived by a resident of one State from immovable property situated in the other State may be taxed in the State where the immovable property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are excluded from the term "immovable property".

Paragraph 4 is a source rule and ensures that the source of income from lease of land or any other interest or rights in land or mineral deposits lies in the country where the property is situated and not where the lease is drawn up or signed.

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 9 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 9 a Contracting State cannot tax the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 8. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 8 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income specifically covered in other Articles of the Convention unless in those Articles specific provision is made to revert to Article 9 in certain given circumstances, eg, paragraph 6 of the Dividend Article, paragraph 4 of the Interest and Royalties Articles.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the business profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax. For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 12 and by paragraph 2 of Articles 13 and 14, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 9, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

8\. Paragraph 8: refer to initial comments above on this Article.

### Article 10 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article Profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(h) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3 below).

Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 12.

2\. Paragraph 2 extends the provisions of paragraph 1 to profits derived by an enterprise as a member of a pooling agreement or similar kind of arrangement with other enterprises.

3\. Paragraph 3 specifically brings within the scope of this Article profits arising from the rental of ships or aircraft or from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers and ancillary equipment provided:

*   The ships, aircraft or containers are used in international traffic, and
*   the enterprise receiving the profits is in the business of operating ships and aircraft in international traffic, and
*   the rental income is incidental to the profits derived from those activities.

It follows that bareboat charter fees will be taxed only in the State of residence of the lessor provided the conditions set out in subparas (a) to (c) above are met.

In the case of container leasing where the conditions in subparas (a) to (c) are not met, the lease payments would come within the scope of Article 14 Royalties, ie, payments for the use of commercial or scientific equipment.

This provision confirms our policy in relation to profits from leasing ships or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and used in international traffic. Such profits continue to be treated as coming within the scope of paragraph 1 of the Article.

### Article 11 - Associated Enterprises

This Article enables an arm's length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 12 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 deals with dividends paid by a New Zealand company to a resident of Ireland. The paragraph gives Ireland the right to tax dividends received by its residents. It also allows New Zealand to tax the dividends but the New Zealand tax is limited to 15 percent of the gross amount even though the rate under our domestic law is 30 percent. The limitation is achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by the company paying the dividends to residents of Ireland.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with dividends paid by an Irish company to a resident of New Zealand. Under sub-paragraph (a) such dividends may be taxed in New Zealand. Subparagraph (b) provides that where such dividends are taxed in New Zealand, Ireland may also tax but the tax is limited to 15 percent of the aggregate amount of the dividend and the tax credit applicable to the dividend under the imputation system of company/shareholder taxation in force in Ireland.

Subparagraph (c) provides in essence that if the dividend is exempt from New Zealand tax, eg, a New Zealand company deriving dividends from an Irish subsidiary company, the dividend will be exempt from tax in Ireland.

3\. Paragraph 3 allows residents of New Zealand who are liable for New Zealand tax on dividends derived from an Irish Company to obtain the benefit of the imputed tax credit on the same basis as Irish residents. The "tax credit" reflects the amount of advance corporation tax (ACT) which has been paid to the Irish Inland Revenue by the company at the time of paying the dividends.

In Ireland the dividend is assessed together with the tax credit on a gross basis and the aggregate amount is subject to tax of up to 15 percent in line with paragraph 2 of the Article.

In the case of a New Zealand resident recipient, where the amount of the tax credit exceeds the Irish tax liability the New Zealand resident may claim a refund of the excess amount from the Irish Inland Revenue by writing to:

_**Office of the Revenue Commissioner**  
Claims Branch  
Dublin Castle  
Dublin 2  
IRELAND_

The letter should contain:

*   Documentary evidence of the tax paid in Ireland;
*   Evidence of the individuals entitlement to the income, subject to the claim, and
*   a letter from the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department to the effect that the claimant is a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax.

**Example - Irish Assessment of Dividend paid to New Zealand Resident**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Description | Amount |
| Company Profit | 100 |
| Corporation Tax | 50  |
| Net profit distributed by way of dividend | 50  |
| Tax Credit 35/65 | 26.92 |
| (Advance Corporation Tax) |     |
| Income of shareholder | 76.92 (credit portion is 27) |
| Withholding Tax at 15% of 77 | 11.53 |
| Received by shareholder | 65.39 |

The refund being the difference between 11.53 and 26.92

New Zealand shareholders entitled to the tax credit are liable to Irish tax in accordance with the above example. For New Zealand tax purposes, the tax credit is included with the dividend as assessable income and a credit (15 percent maximum) is allowed for the Irish tax paid.

Paragraph 3(b) has no application in New Zealand as New Zealand Companies are exempt from tax on dividends received (see paragraph 2 above).

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. In New Zealand the effect is that the term has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

5\. Paragraph 6 deals with dividends arising from shares which are attributable to a permanent establishment. It provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or are otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the state of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 16, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up until 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no Convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

6\. The main effect of paragraph 7 is that it restricts the application taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Ireland".

7\. Paragraph 8 is an anti avoidance provision. It provides that the limitation of tax at source and the imputation credit will not apply where the shares were acquired primarily for the purpose of gaining a tax advantage through the application of the provisions of this Article.

### Article 13 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest.

New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent of gross interest paid to residents of Ireland instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend is excluded from the term. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the Dividends Article.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 16, a fixed base to which the debt - claim in respect of which the interest is paid is attributable.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan is contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by that establishment, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment (eg, arm's-length) is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

7\. Paragraph 7 is also an anti avoidance provision to stop tax advantage through this Article.

### Article 14 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties arise, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of Ireland instead of the usual 15 percent withheld. In New Zealand the limitation will be achieved by the payer of the royalties deducting withholding tax of 10 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax will be limited to 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 8.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Convention, then the 10 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the royalties are attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing independent personal services, a fixed base to which royalties are attributable.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a minimum final tax applies in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 - the comments to paragraph 5, 6 and 7 of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 15 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Ireland sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 concerns income or gains derived from the sale or disposition of:

*   shares in a company which derive their value directly or indirectly from immovable property or;
*   an interest in a partnership or trust whose assets consist principally of immovable property or shares as above.

These gains may be taxed in the country where the immovable property is situated. The term "shares" does not include shares quoted or listed on a recognised stock exchange.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines the term "a recognised stock exchange".

4\. Paragraph 4 deals with income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for performing independent personal services. Such income of gains may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. However, where the movable property consists of shares which are covered by paragraph 2 of this Article, then in the event of sale of the shares the country of residence of the alienator shall have the sole right to tax.

Thus in the case of a New Zealand Permanent Establishment of an Irish company holding shares of this nature, on the sale of those shares the profits will be taxable in Ireland and exempt from tax in New Zealand.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides in essence that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable solely in the State of residence of the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable solely in the State of which the alienator is a resident, however, if that State only taxes the income or gains remitted to it, this paragraph shall not apply to the remaining portion.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that where an individual who is resident in one State, and receives income or gains from the other State, then the provisions of paragraph 6 shall not apply if the individual was resident in the other state at any time within 10 years of the alienation of the property. This is an anti-avoidance measure and ties in with the domestic law of Ireland relating to Capital Gains.

8\. Paragraph 8 defines the term "gains" in the case of Ireland.

### Article 16 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This article concerns income from personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 17. Income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence **unless** the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   is present in the other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any period of twelve consecutive months; or
*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes, who are covered by Article 19.

### Article 17 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the state visited for a period or periods which do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days in any period of twelve consecutive months; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Regarding the 183 day test the term "period of twelve consecutive months" should be noted as the treatment effectively differs from the term "income year" which is used in other treaties.

Where the term "income year" is used for the purposes of the 183 days test each income year is looked at separately in determining the number of days present. Therefore the exemption could apply where a visit of more than 183 days straddles two income years provided the visit does not exceed 183 days in either year.

When applying the "period of twelve consecutive months" criterion it should be remembered that each day means the commencement of a period of 12 months from that particular day. Thus, although a visit may straddle two income years the exemption will not apply if the visit exceeds 183 days over a period of 12 months. For example, an Irish resident who visits New Zealand on 1 November and departs on the following 30 June will not be exempt as he will have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a period of 12 consecutive months.

In this example, it the criterion was an "income year" instead of "period of twelve consecutive months" the visitor would be exempt as at no stage would he be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in **an income year**.

When a visitor from Ireland undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Irish authorities which certifies that that person is resident in Ireland for the purposes of Irish tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of Ireland then Ireland has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee.

### Article 18 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State of residence of the company paying the fees or other similar payments to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 19 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 20 - Pensions and Annuities

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** of the recipient exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 21(2) wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident **and** a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that an Irish Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in Ireland and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in Ireland.

2\. Paragraph 2 states that social security pensions are taxable only in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines the term "annuities".

### Article 21 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual is taxable solely by that State, ie, the country of origin of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable solely in the State where the services are performed provided those services are performed:
    *   by an individual who is a citizen of that State; or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that State and did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of performing those services.

For example, if an Irish Government employee is resident in New Zealand, under our domestic law, he is exempt from New Zealand tax on his government salary if he is resident here "solely for the purpose of rendering the services". However, a locally recruited employee of the Irish Government working in New Zealand is not exempt here irrespective of his citizenship if he is resident in New Zealand for a reason other than working for the Irish Government.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government Pensions (see explanation to Article 20 in this supplement).

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with a business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration.

Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply, ie, Article 17 for wages and salaries, Article 18 for directors' fees and Article 20 for pensions. Article 19 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 22 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax, maintenance, education or training payments received here **from overseas** by a student or business apprentice from Ireland. Note:

*   The student must have been a resident of Ireland immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand for the purpose of his education or training.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or business apprentice going to Ireland.

### Article 23 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not expressly mentioned in other Articles of the Convention. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Ireland. If the income is derived from sources in Ireland it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Irish tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Ireland. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Ireland and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

### Article 24 - Elimination of Double Taxation

This Article contains the rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State.

1\. Paragraph 1 contains the rules whereby a resident of New Zealand is allowed a credit for tax paid in Ireland.

2\. Paragraph 2(a) contains the rules whereby a resident of Ireland is allowed a credit for tax paid in New Zealand, in addition paragraph 2(b) allows an Irish company deriving dividends from a New Zealand company to, in certain circumstances, claim credit in Ireland for the tax paid in New Zealand by the New Zealand company on the profits out of which the dividends are paid. This is in addition to claiming credit for the 15 percent tax on dividends as per Article 12.

3\. Paragraph 3 is a source rule **for the purposes of the Article** in order to solve any dual source cases which may arise thus facilitating the allowance of a credit.

### Article 25 - Non-discrimination

The purpose of this Article is to prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality.

1\. Paragraph 1 establishes the principle that for taxation purposes discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. The paragraph prevents a State from imposing any more burdensome taxation or connected requirement on nationals of the other State than it imposes on its own nationals **in the same circumstances**.

2\. Paragraph 2 requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

3\. Paragraph 3 is designed to end a particular form of discrimination resulting from the fact that in certain countries the deduction of interest, royalties and other disbursements, allowed without restriction when the recipient is resident, is restricted or even prohibited when he is a non-resident. New Zealand does not discriminate between residents and non-residents in this area.

4\. Paragraph 4 prevents discrimination against enterprises which are wholly or partly owned by residents of the other State, eg, a New Zealand subsidiary of an Irish company.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that this Article shall not apply to any provision in taxation laws which:

*   is reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes; **or**
*   is in force in Ireland and New Zealand at present and any subsequent laws which have substantially similar purpose or intent.

Provided that for example New Zealand does not give greater benefits to residents or citizens of third countries than to residents of Ireland.

6\. Paragraph 6 ensures that each country **may distinguish between residents and non-residents**. The paragraph makes it clear that the Article does not prevent different tax treatment solely on the basis of residence.

7\. Paragraph 7 restricts the scope of the Article to those taxes covered by the Convention (see Article 2).

### Article 26 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 27 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no further comment.

### Article 28 - Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officials

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officials shall, under the convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 29 - Entry into Force

The Convention came into force on 26 September 1988 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1989.

In Ireland it takes effect:

*   in respect of income tax, income levy and capital gains tax, for any year of assessment beginning on or after 6 April 1989;
*   in respect of corporation tax, for any financial year beginning on or after 1 January 1989;

### Article 30 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

multi-year, multi-stage change programme which will help IR become the modern world-class revenue organisation which is set out in its vision: IR for the Future. Stage 4 1 will see the completion of the future revenue system. It is the final stage of IR’s transformation journey and will conclude in early 2022 at which point the Business Transformation programme will end. In this time, we will look to transition the knowledge, practises and processes we have developed to support both internal and external stakeholders, into the business progressively. How this happens ties into the way the organisation is set up for the future, with ongoing work on our future operating model in conjunction with He Kōtuitui. 1.1 Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams: 1.1.1 Workstream 1 — START Delivery. This is made up of three key areas: A. Core Completion Delivery: Moving all remaining tax and social policy products into START (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Foreign Trusts, Duties and Unclaimed Monies) and upgrading START and myIR to Version 12. B. New Legislation Delivery: Implementing any new policy into the tax and social policy system. C. Optimisation De livery. Improvement of products and services already in START in full partnership with the business and in consultation with external customers where appropriate. This work will go through a prioritisation pr ocess and while important, will be lower priority than workstreams A and B. 1.1.2 Workstream 2 — Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO). 1.1.3 Workstream 3 — Intel led (IL). 1.1.4 Workstream 4 — Enterprise Support Services (ESS). 1.1.5 Workstream 5 — Transition and Business Integration (T&BI). This Stakeholder Engagement Plan identifies and documents at a high-level the strategy and approach for building and maintaining internal and external stakeholder understanding of, and support for, START Delivery (Workstream 1). For a more detailed view of the BT external stakeholder management approach, this Stakeholder Engagement Plan should also be read in conjunction with the BT Account Management Strategies (scheduled for completion by the end of September). 1 See Appendix 1 for a detailed diagram of Stage 4 Scope Page 7 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 1.2 Strategic engagement for our Stakeholders Effective communication and engagement with a complex array of stakeholders is critical to the success of the transformation within IR, and a key construct of achieving the transformation goal of making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Stage 4 START Delivery has a critical dependency on successfully engaging internal and external stakeholders, both existing and new to the Business Transformation Programme. This includes stakeholders BT has been engaging with to varying degrees since Stage 1 of Business Transformation, for example, the majority of CCS teams within the organisation , an d tax intermediaries, software developers and businesses outside IR; as well as stakeholders who have had less interaction with to the BT Programme who are connected specifically with the final products being moved into START. These include, for example, Trustee Companies for Foreign Trusts and Oranga Tamariki for Child Support. 1.3 Strategic considerations When developing this strategy, we took into account a number of considerations illustrating the landscape of START Delivery: • We know most of our stakeholders, and they know us. • START Delivery affects new stakeholders, as well as existing stakeholders in different ways. • We have effective, well established account and relationship management teams. • IR has established Areas of Focus teams in areas of highest risk and change impact and BT is an integral part of these teams. • We engage and collaborate with the business to achieve successful outcomes. • We acknowledge all the IR change our customers may be facing. • BT communications channels are well developed and fit for purpose. • We are agile and ready to respond to legislation changes and the impacts of COVID-19. 1.4 Stakeholder engagement strategy The above considerations identify some critical elements for success for START Delivery stakeholder engagement. Our strategy is to: • Use what we know works. We will continue to de velop BT’s established engagement methodologies, relationships, processes and channels, particularly for the many stakeholder groups that are familiar with BT change. • Engage effectively with new stakeholders. We will build our understanding and adapt our approach to meet the needs of our new s takeholder groups. • Help our people be ambassadors of change. We will build a deeper understanding of the change with our people first and equipment them to help our customers. • Taking a whole of IR view when engaging with stakeholders. Acknowledging there are benefits and impacts which sit outside of BT change. Page 8 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Be ready to understand, act and adapt. Environmental impacts beyond our control may affect the effectiveness of our engagement. We will be prepared to recognise these impacts, understand them and act quickly in response. Page 9 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 2 Background 2.1 About Inland Revenue Inland Revenue (IR) is an organisation of over 5,000 people located in 17 towns and cities across New Zealand. In the 2018-2019 period, IR collected $79.5 billion of revenue which is 80% of the revenue required by the New Zealand government to fund our country. IR also paid $4.1 billion in Working for Families Tax Credits, KiwiSaver (via scheme providers), paid parental leave payments and payroll subsidies. We collected $471 million in Child Support and passed on $290 million to carers (the difference retained to offset costs of benefits). 2.2 About Business Transformation Business Transformation (BT) is a multi-year, multi-stage change programme which will help IR become the modern world-class revenue organisation that is set out in IR’s vision IR for the Future. The transformation will change IR to make it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. The programme’s objectives are: • Improving agility so policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing our services. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, focused on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. The programme replaces the FIRST core tax and social policy system with START. It also enables other significant shifts including changes to the organisation model, the introduction of supporting technology and a review of policy and legislative settings to frame and support the programme’s objectives. 2.3 Business Transformation progress to date As at June 2020, the following has been delivered: 1. Business Transformation Stage 1: Stage 1 delivered GST and other functions into START including Case manager and Customer Interaction Manager, making GST easier for customers and making the management of GST simpler and faster for IR and the government. 2. Business Transformation Release 2: Release 2 delivered the Accounting Income Method (AIM), Voluntary Payday Filing, Withholding taxes, Fringe Benefits Taxes, Gaming Machine Duty, EMS information collection and imaging correspondence. Page 10 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3. Business Transformation Release 3: Release 3 moved Income tax, donation tax credits, Working for Families tax credits and the Customer Master from FIRST to START. It also included new approaches to meeting tax obligations and paying tax, including automatic income tax assessments for individuals. Payday filing (voluntary in R2) became compulsory. 4. Business Transformation Release 4: Release 4 moved Student Loans, KiwiSaver and the end-to-end processing of employer obligations (PAYE) into START and implemented a number of enhancements to Income tax and Working for Families. 5. Organisation design: In parallel with this activity BT has supported IR through significant change, resulting in more effective ways of working and bringing our people closer to our customers. Although organisation design is still ongoing, it has now been handed to the business for completion. 6. Intelligence-Led: This project will deliver the Data and Intelligence Platform, Stax (enterprise records management system), and the Intelligent Information Project (including guided help, enterprise search and intranet). This is to be delivered in stages through to September 2021. 7. Ātea: Ātea, IR’s new enterprise support services system has been implemented with subsequent updates due over 2020. 2.4 Changes due to COVID-19 In late May 2020, changes were made to the scope and timings of the final stage of the programme to accommodate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Page 11 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3 Stage 4 Scope 3.1 Stage 4 Scope and Workstreams Stage 4 2 will see the completion of the future revenue system. It is the final stage of IR’s transformation journey and will conclude in early 2022 at which point the Business Transformation programme will end. In that time, we will look to transition the knowledge, practises and processes we have developed to support both internal and external stakeholders, into the business progressively. How this happens ties into the way the organisation is set up for the future, with ongoing work on our future operating model in conjunction with He Kōtuitui. Stage 4 will be completed in five workstreams: Workstream 1 — START Delivery: This is made up of three key areas: A. Core Completion Delivery: Moving all remaining tax and social policy products into START (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Foreign Trusts, Duties and Unclaimed Monies) and upgrading START and myIR to Version 12. B. New Legislation Delivery: Implementing any new policy into the tax and social policy system. C. Optimisation Delivery: Improvement of products and services already in START in full partnership with the business. While important, this work will go through a prioritisation process and will be lower priority than workstreams A and B. Workstream 2 — Technology Landscape Optimisation (TLO): Decommissioning and archiving of non-enduring heritage services and a programme of work to ensure that technology environments are simplified, enduring, and sustainable to operate. Workstream 3 — Intel led (IL): The Intelligence Led programme will continue working to bring together two distinct programmes of work — data and analytics and information and knowledge management — into one cohesive eco-system. Workstream 4 — Enterprise Support Services (ESS): This will bring more information and functionality into Ātea over the next year. Workstream 5 — Transition and Business Integration (T&BI): This workstream will focus on the support and transition of our knowledge, methods, practices, and processes back to the business, to enable the programme to wind down and the business to progressively take on the responsibility for delivering change. 2 See Appendix 1 for a detailed diagram of Stage 4 Scope Page 12 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.2 START Delivery In early 2021, move into START: • Paid Parental Leave: Moving Paid Parental Leave into START will bring about the following key changes: o PPL being in the same system as all other products, rather than a standalone system. o Wider range of staff will be able to work on PPL. o Removal of the paper application and replaced with a digital channel, with a phone channel for those that don’t have access to the internet. Customers able to submit applications and update their circumstances via digital channels. o It will also allow automated processing of applications, disbursements and will consider IR’s role in prevention of overpayments. Note: regulation changes are required to enable the significant shift we look to deliver for PPL when it is moved into START. I n 2019, IR made $367 m illion in payments to 66,923 parents. • New Zealand Foreign Trusts: The move to START will allow digital channels for receiving, storing, managing and distributing information and payments as well as enhancing validations to improve data quality and reduce manual handling. As at October 2019 there were 2,991 active trusts. • Duties: The move to START will enable digital channels for receiving and distributing information and money as well as changes to allow for automated processing of returns, payments, P&I, credit offsetting, disbursements and reconciliations. In 2019, payments totalled approximately $115 m illion. • Unclaimed Monies: The move to START will deliver legislative changes to improve aspects of the holder and owner processes such as enhancing information matching to locate owners, allow third party authority to make claims and introduce a 60-year time limit for claims. Further changes include improving compliance for organisations through online service options, providing an online claimant process and automated website list updating holder payments and claimant refund transactions. The database and spreadsheets currently hold more than 500,000 entries worth approximately $214 million. In October 2021 move into START: • Child Support: Moving Child Support into START will modernise and improve information sharing, online services and self-management tools, and deliver straight- through processing with fewer manual interventions, automating large transactional processes and providing a better integration of International Child Support into core systems. It will also deliver legislative changes to improve fairness, simplify aspects of the scheme, improve compliance and deliver on Government goals to improve the wellbeing of children. It may include changes that affect some individuals, such as requiring some to start Page 13 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] paying child support directly via their employer. Note that in 2019, IR collected $471 million from more than 164,000 parents who pay child support. • Upgrade START and myIR to Version 12: The changes will include better functionality, enhanced security, a different navigational structure and a new look and feel. The changes will likely have a medium-high impact for customer facing staff and will be a big change for most customers and especially tax agents. 3.3 New Legislation Delivery This area of focus will allow us to: • Dedicate resource to ensure we can assist, as needed, to support the Government’s COVID-19 response. • Implement legislative changes we may need for the CORE START products, along with Budget initiatives, such as annual returns. The items in this stream are considered must dos and will be prioritised over optimisation tasks. 3.4 Optimisation This area of focus is about transitioning the change processes and methods to IR’s business units with a focus on optimising products and processes already delivered by BT, for example Tax on Income, Working for Families, KiwiSaver, Student Loans and GST. The combined BT and BAU leads will develop the prioritisation approach and model that IR will use post BT and also test the processes and model during the final stage of BT by selecting high value groups of changes that deliver on operational efficiencies and improved customer outcomes. Page 14 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Structure of Stakeholder Engagement and Planning documents This Stakeholder Engagement Plan identifies and documents the strategy and approach for building and maintaining internal and external stakeholder understanding of and support for START Delivery (Workstream 1), covering the period June 2020 – December 2021. Stakeholders are defined as groups or individuals who are impacted by, or will impact on, the implementation of Stage 4 START Delivery. 4.1 Stage 4 Planning documents More detailed planning documents for Stage 4 are below: Stakeholder Engagement for Business Transformation Stage 4 Workstream Details Owner Workstream 1: START Product Delivery Stakeholder Engagement Plan for START Delivery (Stage 4) (this document) Internal Communications Plan BT Communications in collaboration with the business Customer, Stakeholder and Marketing Plan BT Communications in collaboration with Marketing and Communications, and the business Workstream 2: Technology Landscape Optimisation Organisation Impact Assessment, Change, Stakeholder and Communications Plan for Decommissioning and Archiving Organisation Impact Assessment, Change, Stakeholder and Communications Plan for Technology Landscape Optimisation BT OCMT in conjunction with BT Communications Workstream 3: Intel-Led Intelligence Led – Incremental Communications plans BT Communications in conjunction with IIS Communications Workstream 4: Enterprise Support Services ESS Release Change and Communications plans BT Communications for ESS programme Workstream 5: Transition and Business Integration Plan name (TBC) Plan owner (TBC) Page 15 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5 Environment Key internal and external environmental factors that will influence the way we communicate are listed below: 5.1 Internal environment Strengths Weaknesses • BT change and communications processes and tactics are well embedded and engaged with by IR people. o There are high levels of internal awareness of BT. o The roll out experience is well understood and planned for – the milestones for change management are well understood and expected by the business. o Teams waiting for their work to go on START are highly engaged and have already been requesting information. o Product owners and BT Managers are well known and respected in the segments they’re representing. • There are high levels of trust in both BT’s ability to deliver and our people’s capability to learn and adapt. • We have access to a group of key users throughout IR. • Dropping the ‘release’ terminology may cause some initial confusion with our internal stakeholders, who are more familiar with releases rather than stages. • Effective engagement and communications with Child Support customers has a high dependency on the support and involvement of our Child Support team. The team’s unique role, needs and values need to be well understood by the BT team when planning and delivering communications. • Anticipation for START v12 to drive innovation may mean that there is disappointment if there are limitations on improvements. • The update to START v12 brings change on change for teams who have been impacted at every release. Embedding will be difficult as people are still catching up. Page 16 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Opportunities Threats • Getting the remaining tax products into START removes all remaining coexistence for our people and provides an opportunity for teams to look at ongoing service improvements. • V12 is the first upgrade experienced by IR and an opportunity to re-engage our people with START functionality, and how it assists them and our customers. • Stage 4 including Paid Parental Leave will help Families deliver on their Child Support strategy. • Prioritisation and delivery of optimisation initiatives will be delivered in partnership with the business and will provide the blueprint for delivering future change post BT. • The use of new technology throughout the COVID-19 levels has opened new communications channels and ways to engage with our people. • Stage 4 provides the opportunity to bring products currently stored on spreadsheets and databases into START, reducing risk and a significant amount of manual work maintaining them. • Currently only a very small portion of the unclaimed monies held by IR is published. • Updating START to v12, may prove hard, if not harder for our people than introducing a whole new system. • There is risk that messaging around changes delivered from the START delivery workstream may become confused if teams outside BT are also delivering change eg new legislation, optimisation. • The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 may add to our delivery scope and make engagement more difficult, and are not all known — but will include: o Changing priorities for our customers, affecting how we work. o Changes to our working environment – how and where they work. • High levels of change across IR in 2020/2021, including organisation design change, can mean change fatigue, and less focus on Stage 4. • Organisation design change could mean changes to teams and individuals BT depends on for stakeholder engagement, marketing and communications. • The initial publication of the updated Unclaimed Monies list is likely to generate an initial peak of work, greater than the current resourcing – delays in responding or high thresholds of proof may be seen negatively. Page 17 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.3 External environment Strengths Weaknesses • IR’s reputation to deliver change is strong. • External groups understand our go-live processes and trust that we’ll prepare them well for change. • We have very strong external relationship teams (Community Compliance, BT Account Management, External Relationships, Significant Enterprises). • We’ve established good channels to communicate to key external stakeholder groups. • We are clear about who our customers are and what they need from us. • Existing relationships with key government agencies (MSD in particular) can be leveraged to support communications to key external groups. • We are the lead agency for Child Support – customers understand to come to us for information and questions. • The f inal products within Stage 4 have a relatively small customer base – with the possible excep tion of Unclaimed Monies where a lot of people could be interested to find out if they are owed anything. • We are not the lead agency for Paid Parental Leave which may make driving change more challenging. • Employers have played a key role in PPL application with the changes this will different and IR will assist with income information. We need clear information to employers so they can provide correct information to their employees. • Although accountable for Child Support, IR may need to rely on MSD to communicate changes to their staff and customers. • IR may be reliant on other government agencies updating their systems before the benefits to customers from information sharing can be realised. • Testing solutions with customers may be challenging for customer groups such as Child Support. • Some customer groups, particularly those associated with Child Support, may be difficult to reach. • Dropping the ‘release’ terminology may cause some initial confusion with our established stakeholders and audiences, who have become familiar with the term. Page 18 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Opportunities Threats • We’ve built up good relationships with external stakeholders and have good access to third party channels for our communications. We can also use third parties as our advocates. • The upgrade to version 12 presents an opportunity to re-e ngage customers with START functionality, focusing on their needs a nd benefits as opposed to product specifications. • Mobile optimisation for e-services with v12 provides opportunity to reach customers through their preferred channels. • Child Support customers rely on advocacy groups for information. There are further opportunities to work with these groups as we did in Release 3. • The impacts of COVID-19 may make engagement more difficult and are not as yet known — but may include threats to our ability to achieve cut through and communicate effectively, or changes needed to channels as work environments change. • The version 12 upgrade, while offering benefits, is another big change for some critical stakeholders. Some customer groups, having adapted to changes in myIR from previous releases, will again face extensive changes in the user interface. • There may be added complexity where there is a requirement to reach offshore customers. • There are high levels of reputational risk associated with products in START Delivery scope. • Multiple release dates during Stage 4 - (products/legislation/optimisation) may confuse and therefore impact customers awareness, understanding, and consequently what action they may need to take. • While the ability to put all the unclaimed money we hold with a name on the website is a huge opportunity to get money back to customers, there may be questions why IR hasn’t kept the list up- to-date and made the information available sooner. Page 19 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 6 Communications and Engagement Strategy Effective communication and engagement with a complex array of stakeholders is critical to the success of the transformation within IR, and a key construct of achieving the transformation goal of making it simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders to pay their taxes and receive their entitlements. Stage 4 is made up of five workstreams. Workstream 1, START Product Delivery, has a critical dependency on successfully engaging external stakeholders, both existing and new. Some key considerations that shape our stakeholder engagement strategy for START Delivery are: • We know most of our stakeholders, and they know us. o In Stage 4, for the most part, we will be engaging with well-informed stakeholders, both external and internal, who are familiar with IR’s transformation objectives, the new START system and how we’ll engage with them — however, we continue to identify new and effective ways to reach them. • START Delivery affects new stakeholders, or existing stakeholders in different ways than before. o START Delivery will mean engagement with new stakeholder groups, as well as different types of engagement with current stakeholders. Effective engagement with these groups is critical. o More detail on these new stakeholders can be found in Section 7, New external stakeholders for START Delivery. • START v12 is an upgrade, not a product. o We must take a different approach to communication and engagement of an upgrade over a product, with potential to ‘relaunch’ START to both our people and customers with a focus on benefits to teams and customer groups. o We will look to empower our people to help customers with a better understanding of the system. • We have effective, well established account and relationship management teams. o Our BT Account Management team is well established and recognised at every external audit to be effective. o The BT Account Management team (comprised of Account Managers and External Relationship Managers) works collaboratively to manage engagement with external stakeholders, with a focus on groups such as professional bodies, software developers, banks and financial institutions, business organisations, Maori authorities, significant enterprises and customer advocacy groups, supporting grass roots engagement from within the organisation. More information on our account management function can be found in Section 8. Page 20 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] o BT has developed effective working relationships with customer facing teams including Community Compliance and Significant Enterprise by developing targeted webinars and supporting CCOM, their Tax Agent Network Group who manage initiatives for Tax Agents and Small Business, engaging with their Tax Agent Cohort as needed. SE Business Life Cycle managers will play an important role supporting their customer groups, specifically with the early release. • We acknowledge all the IR change our customers may be facing. o Stakeholders are increasingly not seeing a difference between transformation and the rest of IR’s activities, for example COVID-19 support, or transformation initiatives which have become business activities, for example Autocalc and Payday Filing. o Stakeholders are looking to IR to provide joined up information on what they need to know, across current and previous BT activities, and other IR activities. o Many external stakeholders have multiple, varied interactions and touchpoints with IR, and we have learned consistent information across these touchpoints is essential. • BT is an integral part of IR’s Areas of Focus teams in areas of highest risk and change impact. o We have seen great value in being part of the Areas of Focus teams which brings together IR expertise across broad areas of stakeholder engagement, for example tax agents and intermediaries, b usiness and specific products such as Investment Income. This concept, introduced under Release 3, has continued through Release 4 , led by CCS. It has proved successful to look at the bigger picture for stakeholders including, but not solely focused on, business transformation. o However, it has identified gaps in the current communication model, with BT providing proactive and reactive communications support to some external stakeholders beyond specific marketing campaigns. • We engage and collaborate with the business. o Internally, BT has created an effective method of engagement with teams, moving away from change being driven (pushed) by BT, to BT supporting the business to drive and integrate change (pulled) — for example, the Get Ready campaign promoted significant re-engagement with R4 collateral pre go-live. o START Delivery Stage 4 will see us build further on existing collaborative partnerships and develop new ones where the release touches new areas and specialist teams administering products — for example, Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Duties, NZ Foreign Trusts and Unclaimed Monies. • BT communications channels are well developed and fit for purpose. o Over the years of transformation IR has moved to more digital and diverse channels in response to changing stakeholder expectations and needs. o This has meant the pace and currency of communications has improved. With the exception of the successful webinar platform, ON24, BT ‘owns’ few channels itself, Page 21 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] but focuses on supporting others (ELT, CCS-I and CCS-B, account managers, Marketing and Communications etc) to engage with our stakeholders. • We are agile and ready to respond to legislation changes and the impacts of COVID-19. o COVID-19 affects all New Zealanders in varying ways. We do not know for certain the impacts that COVID-19 will have on our engagement strategy, but challenges could include a lower level of engagement due to changing priorities, and the need to change approach quickly if our existing engagement activities do not suit those in different working environments from before. 6.1 Communications Strategy The above considerations identify some critical elements for success for START Delivery stakeholder engagement. Our strategy is to: • Use what we know works. We will continue to develop our established engagement methodologies, relationships, processes and channels, particularly for the many stakeholder groups that are familiar with BT change. • Engage effectively with new stakeholders. We will build our understanding and adapt our approach to meet the needs of our new stakeholder groups. • Help our people be ambassadors of change. We will build a deeper understanding of the change with our people first and equipment them to help our customers. • Taking a whole of IR view when engaging with stakeholders. Acknowledging there are benefits and impacts which sit outside of BT change. • Be ready to understand, act and adapt. Environmental impacts beyond our control may affect the effectiveness of our engagement. We will be prepared to recognise these impacts, understand them and act quickly in response. 6.2 Communications Objectives Successful communications provides both a proactive strategy and reactive mitigations. At a broad level our communications objectives are: • Decision makers and influencers support the transformation and have continued confidence in IR’s ability to deliver. • Everyone impacted by START Delivery change during Stage 4, both internally and externally, knows: o What will change? o What they will need to do differently and when? o Where to get help if they have problems? • Key external and internal stakeholders feel they have been engaged and involved in transformation and understand and support the need for change. • Communications risks are identified, managed and mitigated. 6.3 Communications Principles Communications principles remain unchanged: Page 22 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Tell one IR story. • Be centred on our customers. • Be simple, open and certain. • Engage the right people with the right information at the right time. • Use plain English. • Tell our people first. Page 23 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7 External Stakeholder Identification 7.1 External Stakeholder categorisation Stakeholders are categorised into four groups: • Government. • Key Influencers. • Customers. • Service Providers. Almost all of our stakeholders fall into more than one of these categories and interact with us in different ways. New stakeholder groups for Business Transformation are highlighted in red, with more information on new stakeholder groups following the table. Detailed information for each stakeholder group, existing and new, is listed in Appendix 2 – Detailed External Stakeholder Analysis. Note that more stakeholders will be added/identified once further analysis is done of the other components of Workstream 1. Figure 1: Stakeholders Page 24 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 7.2 New External Stakeholders for START Delivery Included in the above categories are our new stakeholder groups for START Delivery. Earlier, we identified that focusing on understanding and meeting the needs of these groups is critical to our engagement strategy. • MSD, MBIE, DIA and Treasury. They will become partners in the change, so we’ll engage with them more closely and in different ways than we have done previously. • Those paying or receiving Child Support and/or involved in the child support process. \[Information redacted\] • Existing PPL applicants (those who have applied and/or are receiving payments), there will be changes to how they can manage their PPL. In addition, there will be general information for anyone looking to apply indicating changes will come in from Stage 4. For employers, they will no longer need to verify the customer income in the application, this will be done using the employment information they have provided through the employment information filed to IR. High value stakeholders involved with NZ Foreign Trusts. This small but influential stakeholder group includes DIA, the NZ Financial Intelligence Unit (part of the New Zealand Police) and foreign trust and company service providers. \[Information redacted\] • New stakeholder groups affected by changes to Duties, including the New Zealand Lotteries Commission, the Racing Industry Transition Agency (formerly NZ Racing Board) and casinos. The main change for this audience is moving to more digitised processes. • New stakeholder groups affected by changes to Unclaimed Monies. This group includes Treasury, Public Trust, government agencies and financial institutions. The main change for these stakeholders is the move to more digitised processes, and legislative change, including when money is considered unclaimed. There will also be changes for the wider public as Unclaimed Monies are made more discoverable and making the claiming process easier for people. Page 25 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 8 External Stakeholder Engagement Inland Revenue interacts with external stakeholders on many levels through its day-to-day activities, as taxpayers, employers, partners, suppliers, as part of industry groups and as a result of the changes being delivered as part of the Business Transformation programme. From the beginning of the Business Transformation programme, we have adopted an open and transparent approach to engaging and communicating with our stakeholders, including our customers. This principle will continue in Stage 4. 8.1 Stage 4 START Delivery Customer Impacts The Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery suggests the following levels of impact for our customers. Areas of medium and high impact are highlighted in amber and red. Figure 2: Preliminary Customer Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery 8.2 BT Account Management For Stage 4, BT Communications will continue to work with the BT Account Management team (which includes members of the External Relationships team), Product Owners, Community Compliance, with International Revenue Strategy and the Families Segment where appropriate to manage engagement with impacted external stakeholders. The BT Account Management team is the primary conduit for managing external customer and stakeholder relationships and will continue to be accountable for external engagement across IR’s customer segments for Business Transformation’s Stage 4. This is done by establishing and maintaining successful engagements with customers (and/or their advocacy groups) who are impacted by IR’s transformation and by providing a channel for their feedback directly to the programme. Page 26 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The Account Management team aims to: • Through a thorough understanding of the customers assist their understanding and engagement with IR’s transformation objectives and explore how they will be impacted. • Engage, advise and support customers when BT changes impact them. • Ensure the customer voice is heard when design/solutions are being considered. • Provide feedback within BT on customers’ issues and concerns with change driven by BT. • Work alongside our customers and the programme teams to stay on track to deliver the outcomes we have agreed. • Work alongside teams within BT and across the business to support customers impacted by BT changes and to make sure the right transformation messages are shared across all customer segments. BT Account Management are an integral part of Area of Focus teams and work closely with the business (Community Compliance Officers and Account Managers, Business Lifecycle Managers, the External Relationships unit and other business units within IR) and within the BT Programme, to make sure: • Operational teams have the right transformation messages to share with customers. • The business is supported. 8.3 Role of BT Communications 8.3.1 Informing Communications and Stakeholder Engagement activity All BT Communications and Stakeholder engagement activities will take advice and input from the BT Policy team in terms of what can be said and when, along with Product Owners, to ensure messaging is accurate and appropriate to the audience. BT activities will supplement, but not replace, ‘business as usual’ activities. The monthly external stakeholder management meeting to monitor customer readiness, led by BT Account Management and attended by product owners, digital leads, Community Compliance, customer change, Marketing and BT communications will continue throughout Stage 4. 8.3.2 Working with IR Marketing and Communications A Customer, Stakeholder and Marketing Plan for START Delivery Stage 4 will be developed in collaboration with the Marketing and Communications team. This will include an update to the stakeholder plan in line with the second, more detailed impact assessment. Messaging from this will be woven into the overall stakeholder and engagement communications activity and will inform the messaging for all customer groups. In the meantime, the Marketing, BT Communications and Account Management teams will work closely to start building the Stage 4 narrative and agree a timeline of messages appropriate for each audience. 8.3.1 Supporting Account Management The BT Communications and Engagement team will work closely with the BT Account Management team to maintain a schedule of planned engagement, develop core messages and information to provide a basis for Stage 4 communications, and presentation material to Page 27 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] support those engagements, and support them with their Stage 4 related communication needs. The weekly communications meeting between BT Account Management, Communications and Marketing and the Change Team will continue through Stage 4. 8.3.2 Supporting other key Stakeholder Groups The BT Communications team also has responsibility for supporting communications for other key stakeholder groups: • Ministerial and Government (in conjunction with the BT Business Case team) Supporting messaging to ensure Ministers have trust and confidence in IR’s ability to deliver business transformation, are supportive of the programme approach and understand how it links to cross-government initiatives such as the Business Growth Agenda. • Other key partners and stakeholders Tax intermediaries, government agencies with whom we share information, banks and software developers will continue to be key groups for IR to engage with as we move into our final phase of transformation. Page 28 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 9 Internal Stakeholder categorisation 9.1 Internal Stakeholder categorisation Internally, our stakeholders are categorised below. Detailed information can be found in Appendix 3 - Detailed Internal Stakeholder Analysis. • Decision-makers: Executive Leadership Team, members of boards, governance and reference groups. • Influencers: IR people (mainly leaders) whose opinion and positive perception of the programme will contribute to its success. • Senior leaders (tiers 3 and 4): broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS- B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). • Team leaders and group leads: broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS- B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). • Our people: broken into those significantly impacted (CCS-I, CCS-B, and PF&F) and those not (other business groups). O f particular note are: o The Families Segment (particularly Child Support teams which are located in ten regions, and the Families Segment Leadership Team) and the Paid Parental Leave team (currently in the Individuals Segment and moving into the Families segment mid 2020). o People in the International Revenue Strategy team who manage NZ Foreign Trusts. o Individuals Segment (particularly the Transactional teams in Upper Hutt who manage unclaimed monies and duties) and the Contact Centre. o Community Compliance who manage front-of -house and account manage tax agents. Note that the Child Support and Paid Parental Leave teams’ unique role, needs and values need to be well understood by the BT team when planning and delivering communications. • Key users. • Unions. • BT Team. Page 29 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10 Internal Stakeholder Engagement Inland Revenue is made up of approximately 5,500 people in 17 locations across New Zealand. A significant proportion are customer-facing teams including people who complete tax- technical, tax-policy and back office functions. Many of these people have been directly touched by the changes delivered through BT with all people at IR impacted in some way by IR’s broader transformation goals. Through previous releases, BT has created an effective method of engagement with teams, moving away from change being driven (pushed) by BT to BT supporting the business to drive and integrate change (pulled). Stage 4 will see us build on the existing collaborative partnerships we have with internal teams and will see us develop new partnerships with specialist teams administering products in Workstream 1A (Child Support, Paid Parental Leave, Duties, Foreign Trust and Unclaimed monies). The proven success of internal communications tactics used in previous releases will be used again where appropriate, for example where the change is wide-ranging and touches multiple audiences across the business such as for the START v12 upgrade. BT communications shares information with IR audiences through several channels it manages directly. In addition to providing content through existing channels, with the products impacting smaller, specialist teams, there is an opportunity to be more targeted in Stage 4 including utilising key users, specific group and team leaders, segment newsletters and TEAMS sites. We will also seek to make the most of our new technology to engage people via digital channels to negate the need for large scale events and travel. 10.1 Stage 4 START Delivery Organisation Impacts The Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery suggests the following levels of impact for our customers. Areas of medium and high impact are highlighted in amber and red. Page 30 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Figure 3: Preliminary Organisation Change Impact Assessment for Stage 4 START Delivery 10.2 Approach In Stage 4, even more so than in previous stages and releases, though with some exceptions, we are dealing with well-informed internal stakeholders who understand the strategic priorities of transformation, and who have become accustomed to both the volume of change and the processes involved in changes that affect the ways they work. Key aspects of our communications are: • Under the principle of right information to the right people at the right time, we will inform our people of the changes and what they mean to them, with particular focus on go-live readiness for directly impacted teams. • We will continue to work to establish a pull model of change management, delivering change in partnership with the business (a co-change approach). We will work alongside customer facing teams and their leaders to engage them in what the changes will mean for them and their customers. • We will provide support to the Product Owners, Channel Owners and Business Transformation Managers linked with our internal stakeholder groups and will actively identify and support advocates to help us tell our story internally. • In collaboration with People and Culture, we will also continue to build and nurture a strong relationship with unions through established channels, reviewing these as necessary to ensure they continue to meet transformation and union objectives. Page 31 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 10.3 Relationship with Unions The Transformation Programme continues to build and nurture a strong relationship with unions, in collaboration with People and Culture, who are responsible for IR’s overall union relationship strategy. Unions will be managed with the support of BT Communications. The BT relationship owner will be the Stage 4 START Delivery OCMT lead. We will continue to build upon this relationship through established channels, reviewing these as necessary to ensure they continue to meet transformation and union objectives. Engagement to date has included monthly teleconferences, hosting quarterly and six-monthly events, and our attendance at national union meetings, as well as specialised involvement such as weekly teleconferences with nominated members during Early Life Support. Further details will be available in the planning documents for each workstream. Page 32 of 48 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 11 Measurement It is essential that we measure what we do and set targets for the future, giving us the ability to actively adapt plans in response. Our communications objectives, as set out in Section 6: Communications and Engagement Strategy, a re listed below, with measurements associated with each: Communications objective Measurement Decision makers and influencers understand the rationale for and support the transformation and have confidence in IR’s ability to deliver. • Feedback from governance groups and Ministers. • Media measures, including articles and opinion pieces from IR experts and identified business and media influencers and commentators. • Feedback from internal key influencers group. Everyone impacted by Stage 4 changes, both internally and externally, knows: • What will change? • What they will need to do differently and when? • The benefits delivered in this phase of change • Where to get help if they have problems? • Customer readiness surveys. • Data and statistics on customers carrying out tasks they need to do before go-live, calls to contact centres, visits to customer-facing offices. • Questions asked and answered through webinars and other engagements. • Business and people readiness survey. Stakeholder, customers and partners feel they have been engaged and involved in transformation and understand and support the need for change. • Customer Insight and Evaluation (CI&E) Customer Readiness Surveys. • Feedback from key external groups. • BT generated coverage in industry media. Communications risks are managed and mitigated. • Measured as per BT Risk Register.

Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1981
==========================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1981 from PIB vol 114 Aug 1981.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 114, August 1981.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

Changes To Stamp Duties Legislation
-----------------------------------

The Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1981 was passed on 9 July 1981 to give effect to the Budget announcement to:

*   abolish both the first home and the larger/smaller home exemptions.
*   introduce a new reduction in conveyance duty equivalent to an exemption for the first $50,000 on the purchase of an owner/occupied home.
*   increase the rate of conveyance duty from a flat rate of 1 percent of the value conveyed, to the following graduated scale:

| Value of Property Conveyed | Rate of Duty |
| --- | --- |
| First $50,000 | 1%  |
| Excess over $50,000 up to $100,000 | 1.5% |
| Excess over $100,000 | 2%  |

*   increase the rate of deed duty from S1 to $10.
*   increase the rate of denoting duty from 40 cents to $1.
*   introduce a new duty called credit card transaction duty of 5 cents per transaction entered into by the holders of multi-purpose credit cards.

The main aspects of the provisions are detailed below.

*   **Abolish the first home and the larger/smaller home exemptions**

*   _(Sections 22A and 22C Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.)_

These sections have been repealed from 10 July 1981. However, conveyances executed prior to 10 July in respect of:

*   the purchase of a first home,
*   the purchase and sale of a home where the sole occupier or those over 45 years of age sell to a growing family, and
*   the purchase of the alternative home,

will still be exempt from conveyance duty.

*   **Reduction in duty for residential properties**

*   _Applies to instruments of conveyances executed on or after 10 July 1981 in respect of:_

*   transfers of land on which a dwellinghouse is erected,
*   transfers of residential land, i.e., land which is acquired for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it,
*   transfers of shares which have the effect of granting a right to occupy a dwellinghouse or unit. Provided that as soon as practicable, after the transfer, the dwellinghouse or residential land is occupied as a residence by:
*   the purchaser, or
*   the purchaser and a member of his/her immediate family, or
*   any member or members of the purchaser's family, or
*   a beneficiary or beneficiaries where a trustee purchases a dwellinghouse for the use of that beneficiary or those beneficiaries.

Where the residential land exceeds 4,500 square metres or where the dwelling is used partly for non-residential purposes, the Commissioner may need to apportion the reduction.

Application for the reduction in conveyance duty should be made on form IR673 available from the Department's district offices.

**Note:** The exemptions in respect of the purchase of a first farm under section 22B of the Act and new dwellings under section 24 continue to apply.

*   **Increase the rate of conveyance duty**
    *   The new rates apply in respect of conveyances executed on or after 10 July 1981 which were previously subject to conveyance duty at the fiat rate of 1 percent. Conveyances of shares, mortgages, debentures and mining rights remain subject to conveyance duty of 40 cents per $100 (or part of $100).

*   **Increase in the rate of deed duty.**
    *   Applies to deeds executed on or after 10 July 1981.

*   **Increase in the rate of denoting duty.**
    *   Applies to counterparts and duplicates executed on or after 10 July 1981.

*   **Credit Card Transaction Duty.**
    *   This is a new duty, somewhat akin to cheque duty, imposed on certain transactions involving the use of a credit card and applies to such transactions entered into on or after 10 July 1981.

Transactions which are liable are those entered into in New Zealand (whether by an overseas visitor or a New Zealand resident) in which a credit card is used to:

*   purchase goods,
*   pay for the supply of services,
*   obtain cash,
*   pay an account or otherwise receive money's worth,

The important point is that if the card is used in New Zealand for a transaction with a third party, then the transaction is liable to the duty. The use of a card to transact business with the issuer of that card e.g. merely as a form of identification, does not attract duty. Also no duty is payable if the card is used overseas.

If any merchant has issued a card which can be used for credit transactions with other merchants then he should contact his local Inland Revenue Office.

The duty of 5 cents per liable transaction is payable by the agency or merchant issuing the credit card.

Payment is to be made quarterly to the:

_**District Commissioner**, Inland Revenue Department, Private Bag, WELLINGTON._

and is to be accompanied by a statement setting out the number of liable transactions which have been debited to card holders' accounts during the quarter and the number of transactions by overseas visitors for which the New Zealand merchants have been paid. Forms for this purpose are being printed.

Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1982
==========================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1982 from PIB vol 120 Mar 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 120, March 1983.

### Section 1 - Short Title, Commencement and Application

Subsection (1) provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with, and form part of, the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

Subsection (2) provides that the Act applies in respect of every instrument of conveyance executed on or after 6 August 1982.

### Section 2 - Conveyance Duty

Subsection (1) of this section amends section 15 of the principal Act by inserting a new subsection (2B) to ensure that an unfair advantage cannot be derived by transferring property by way of separate instruments each conveying a partial interest in that property.

Legislation was enacted in 1981 to give effect to the 1981 Budget announcement to abolish the "first home exemption" and the "larger/smaller home exemption" and to introduce a new reduction in conveyance duty, equivalent to an exemption for the first $50,000 of the value of the property conveyed, on the purchase of an owner/occupied home.

The rate at which conveyance duty is charged was altered at the same time from a flat rate of 1 percent of the value conveyed to a three level graduated scale with a maximum rate of 2 percent.

Since the new measures were introduced, cases have been presented where a property has been transferred by way of separate instruments conveying fractional interests. The effect was that each instrument stood by itself for the purposes of the residential home reduction in duty and the rate at which duty is assessed.

Even where the residential home reduction was not available, such as in the transfer of commercial properties, instruments conveying fractional interests attracted a lower rate of duty than would have been assessed under the graduated scale had the transfer been by way of one document.

The amendment to section 15 remedies this situation by in effect treating the separate instruments as one instrument for the purpose of computing conveyance duty.

This is achieved by adding together progressively the values of the property conveyed by each of the instruments and computing conveyance duty on that progressive value. The duty so computed is then reduced by the amount of duty already payable or paid on the instruments that have previously been stamped. This effect is best explained by way of illustration.

**NB**

*   Subsection (2B)(a) - requires that an instrument be an instrument of conveyance of a partial interest in property.
*   Subsection (2B)(b) - requires that the instrument be one of two or more such instruments of conveyance in relation to that same property.
*   Subsection (2B)(c) - aggregates the values of the instruments for duty purposes.
*   Subsection (2B)(d) - allows a deduction for the duty payable or paid on the previously stamped instruments.

**Application of the new legislation in given situation**

Residential home $150,000 sold by "S" to "Z" by way of 3 instruments of conveyance each conveying a one-third interest in the property. The instruments are presented for stamping over a period of three weeks, ie, one per week. Documents A: B: C:

**STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE, by reference to section 15(2B)**

_Document A_

Paragraph (a) - Yes - Document A is an instrument conveying a partial interest.

Paragraph (b) - No - it is not (so far as is known at this time) 1 of 2 or more such instruments.

Duty is therefore computed as for "ordinary" instrument of conveyance (s 15(2A)):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Duty on $50,000 | $500 |
| Less residential home reduction in duty | $500 |
| Duty Payable | NIL |

_Document B_

Paragraph (a) - Yes - Document B is an instrument conveying a partial interest.

Paragraph (b) - Yes, it is known to be 1 of 2 or more such instruments.

Paragraph (c) - conveyance duty is computed on Document B as if the value conveyed by it were the sum of:

*   the value conveyed by Document B, ie, $50,000; and
*   the value conveyed by the other instruments referred to in paragraph (b) on which duty has already been computed, ie, Document A $50,000.

Thus duty is to be computed on -

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $50,000 Document B, |     |
|     | Plus | $50,000 Document A |     |
| Duty on |     | $100,000 is | $1,250 |
| Less residential home reduction in duty |     |     | $500 |
| $750 |     |     |     |

Paragraph (d) - from the duty so computed a deduction is allowed for the duty payable on the document(s) referred to in paragraph (c), ie, Document A - Nil duty and therefore Nil deduction.

**The balance $750 is the duty payable on Document B**

_Document C_

Paragraph (a) - Yes - Document C is an instrument conveying a fractional interest.

Paragraph (b) - Yes - it is known to be 1 of 2 or more such instruments.

Paragraph (c) - conveyance duty is computed on Document C as if the value conveyed by it were the sum of:

*   the value conveyed by Document C, ie, $50,000; and
*   the value conveyed by the other instruments referred to in paragraph (b), ie, Document A $50,000 Document B $50,000.

**NB:** Although in computing duty on Document B the dutiable value was calculated by adding the value in Document A to that in Document B, this "calculated" value is not the value conveyed by Document B for the purpose of aggregating the values under (c).

Thus duty computed on -

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | $50,000 Document C |     |
|     | plus | $50,000 Document B |     |
|     | plus | $50,000 Document A |     |
|     |     | $150,000 |     |
| Duty on $150,000 is |     |     | $2,250 |
| Less residential home reduction in duty |     |     | 500 |
| Duty |     |     | $1.750 |

**The balance, ie, $1,000 is the duty payable on Document C.**

_**PROOF**_

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duty payable per above |     |     |     |
|     | Document A | NIL |     |
|     | Document B | $750 |     |
|     | Document C | $1,000 |     |
|     |     |     | $1,750 |
| Duty payable if transfer by one instrument |     |     | $1,750. |

Subsection (2) amends section 15(3) of the principal Act by excluding conveyances of shares, mortgages, debentures, mining rights, etc, from the provisions of the new subsections (2B) and   (2C).

### Section 3 - Stamp Duty Exemption on First Farm Purchases

Previously, to obtain the benefit of an exemption from conveyance duty on the purchase of a first farm, one of the conditions was that the purchaser must not own or have owned an interest in farm land or shares in a farming company, the value of which exceeds $100,000.

(The figure of $50,000 specified in the original definition of "substantial interest" in section 22B(7) of the Act was increased in 1981 to $100,000 by Order-in-Council.)

Section 3 of this Amendment Act increases the limit from $100,000 to $150,000 and applies to every instrument of conveyance of farm land or shares in a farming company executed after Budget night. Where there is more than one instrument in respect of the same transaction, for example, a transfer and agreement for sale and purchase, the Order applies only if the earliest instrument is executed on or after that date. The new figure of $150,000 is largely to keep pace with current market values, because of increases in values of farm land since 1981.

The effect of the amendment is that a person who holds or has held an interest in farm land or shares in a farming company valued at $150,000 or less, will be entitled to the exemption on the conveyance to him of other farm land or shares provided the other requirements of section 22B are met.

Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act, Supplement 1, 1983
=========================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act, Supplement 1, 1983 from PIB vol 126, suppl 1 Sep 1984.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 126, Supplement 1, September 1984.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title, Commencement and Application

Subsection 1 provides that this Amendment Act is to be read with, and is part of, the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

Subsection 2 provides that, with the exception of sections 5 and 6, the Amendment Act came into force on the day the Act received the Governor General's assent, that is the 23rd day of November 1983.

Section 5 is deemed to have come into force on 18 July 1983, while section 6 is deemed to have come into force on 1 April 1983.

### Sections 2, 3 and 4

**Background**

Sections 2, 3 and 4 make amendments to sections 24, 24A and 35 of the principal Act respectively.

The amendments are, in the main, a consequence of the judgment of Thorp, J. in _Dempster and Attwell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_. The judgment held that the reduction in duty given by section 24A of the principal Act in respect of the conveyance of certain dwellinghouses used as residences should be given irrespective of the fact that the dwellinghouse conveyed would be used as a holiday home.

As this was not the intention of section 24A when it was enacted in 1981, the deficiency has been corrected in this Act by providing that the dwellinghouse concerned must be for use not only as a residence but also as a principal place of abode. As the same possible loophole existed in sections 24 and 35 of the principal Act each of those sections has also been amended in a similar manner. (Sections 24 and 35 relate to a reduction of conveyance duty on, respectively, the first conveyance of land with a new dwellinghouse and on the first lease of a new dwellinghouse.)

As stated above, sections 2, 3 and 4 apply from the date the Bill received the Governor General's assent, that is 23 November 1983.

### Section 2 - Conveyance Duty Reduced on First Conveyance of Land with New Dwellinghouse

This section amends section 24 of the principal Act. It repeals the definition of the term "dwellinghouse" in subsection (3) and substitutes a new definition. The important words in the new definition are "a building erected or to be erected solely as a residence for the exclusive occupation, as the _principal place of abode_".

The insertion of these words will ensure that the relief from conveyance duty provided by section 24 cannot be extended to holiday homes.

### Section 3 - Conveyance Duty Reduced on Instrument of Conveyance of Dwellinghouse

This section amends section 24A of the principal Act. Subsection (1) amends section 24A(2)(a) by adding, after the words in the subsection "be occupied primarily or principally as a residence", the words "and principal place of abode".

This removes the former deficiency revealed by Dempster and Attwell v. C.I.R inasmuch as a holiday home will now be excluded because it will be unable to satisfy the "principal place of abode" test.

Subsection (2) amends section 24A(3) to specify in clearer manner the provision relating to the area of land which, when it exceeds 4,500m2, will qualify as being necesssary for the reasonable occupation of the land. The circumstances to which the Commissioner may have regard when determining the area that is "reasonable" have been expanded to include the _nature_of the land concerned; previously regard could be had to only the size and character of the dwellinghouse erected or to be erected on the land.

### Section 4 - Lease Duty Reduced on First Lease of New Dwellinghouse

This section amends section 35 of the principal Act. The amendment repeals and substiutes the definition of the term "dwellinghouse" in subsection (3), by adding the requirement that the dwellinghouse concerned be erected as a _principal place of abode_. It thus ensures that section 35 does not apply to holiday homes.

### Section 5 - Composition by the NZ Stock Exchange in Respect of Stamp Duty on Shares

Section 5 amends 51A of the principal Act which authorises members of stock exchanges to pay the stamp duty on sharemarket transactions directly to the Department each month.

The existing provisions of section 51A refer to the former Stock Exchange Association of New Zealand and its affiliates, namely, the Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch/Invercargill and Dunedin stock exchanges.

The Sharebrokers Amendment Act 1981 was brought into force by the Sharebrokers Amendment Act Commencement Order 1983 on 18 July 1983. The effect of that 1981 Act is to establish the New Zealand Stock Exchange and regional stock exchanges which are the successors to the Stock Exchange Association of New Zealand and its affiliates. It was therefore necessary to amend section 51A to reflect the change of name to the New Zealand Stock Exchange.

The change of name is reflected in the amendments to subsections (1), (3) and (5) of section 51A which are provided by subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section.

Subsection (4) deems this section to have come into force on 18 July 1983, which is the date of commencement of the provisions of the Sharebrokers Amendment Act 1981. It also ensures that the agreement between the Commissioner and the Stock Exchange Association of New Zealand will remain in force, and provides that that agreement is deemed (from 18 July 1983) to have been made with the New Zealand Stock Exchange.

### Section 6 - No Cheque Duty Payable on Certain Bills

This section amends section 79(1)(g) of the principal Act.

The amendment merely continues the exemption from Cheque Duty which Credit Unions had enjoyed in the past. This was made necessary as a result of the enactment of the Friendly Societies and Credt Unions Act 1982 which introduced a _separate_defintion of "Credit Union" which had not existed in the previous legislation governing those organisations.

This section has effect from 1 April 1983, which is the commencement date of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982.

Stamp Duties Amendment Act 1964
===============================

Archived legislative commentary on the Stamp Duties Amendment Act 1964 from PIB vol 16 Dec 1964.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin Volume_ 16, December 1964.

[More information about Public Information Bulletins.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

This Act was passed on 18 November 1964. It effects two amendments to the present stamp duty laws. The first gives a concession on me first purchase of an "own your own" flat in circumstances where the purchaser acquires an undivided interest in the land on which the flats are built. Details of this concession were printed in Public Information Bulletin Number 7 and to help the public are reprinted in this issue. The second amendment enables sharebrokers to stamp certain transfers of shares with adhesive stamps and it is hoped that this will assist them when dealing with transfers of small lots.

### Stamp duty on purchases of "Own your own" flats

The concession extends that provided by Section 77A of the Stamp Duties Act 1954 for purchases of newly erected dwelling-houses and will operate in similar manner.

Points to be noted are -

#### Scope of the concession

The concession applies where an undivided share of land is transferred for valuable consideration and is accompanied by an agreement which gives the purchaser a right of exclusive use and occupation of one of the flats erected or to be erected on the land.

#### Definition of "Flat" for purposes of concession

For this purpose a flat is taken to mean a separate residence in a building or buildings erected or to be erected on the land solely as separate residences for each of more than one family. The building or buildings may include the usual appurtenances such as wash-houses or garages but must not include other large improvements such as shops or offices.

**Purchaser must have first use of flat**  
The flat must not have been lived in prior to the sale.

**Only one concession can be allowed**  
The concession cannot be granted more than once in respect of any particular flat.

**Date from which concession operates**  
The concession will be given only if the date of the sale was on or after 1 December 1963. For this purpose the date of sale is taken as the date the instrument or earliest instrument of agreement of sale was executed or where there is no such instrument, the date of the instrument of transfer.

**Evidence required in support of application**  
When a concession is sought the purchaser will be asked to give the Department a statutory declaration setting out -

*   That under an agreement of sale (or Memorandum of Transfer as the case may be) which is dated ... he purchased from ... (vendor's name) an undivided share in the land described as ... (description in agreement or Transfer)
*   That the building erected on the land is for separate residences only and that the only other improvements effected on the said land are .... (state briefly).
*   That by virtue of the purchase he acquires the right of exclusive use and occupation of a separate residence in the said building being ... (specify).
*   That such separate residence has not at any time prior to the sale been resided in by any person.
*   That the unimproved value of the land as shown on the district valuation roll, a copy of which is annexed is £ ... .

### Stamping of transfers of small lots of shares by sharebrokers

**Section 3** of the Amendment Act provides -

*   "The principal Act is hereby amended by inserting, after section 66, the following section:  
    *   "66A Where shares are purchased through the agency of a sharebroker for full consideration of a value not exceeding twenty pounds, the instrument of transfer of those shares may either be presented for stamping by the Inland Revenue Department in accordance with Part II of this Act or be stamped with an adhesive stamp to be cancelled by that sharebroker or any of his employees within three months after and exclusive of the date of its execution."

#### Points to watch

Points to be particularly noted are -

*   The shares are to have been purchased through the agency of a sharebroker.
*   The price is to be the full value of the shares and is not to exceed £20.
*   The stamp is to be affixed within three months after the share transfer has been executed.
*   The stamp is to be cancelled by the sharebroker or any of his employees.

#### The rules for cancellation of stamps

The rules for cancelling adhesive stamps are set out in Section 45 of the Stamp Duties Act 1954. This section reads -

*   "45 (1) An instrument the duty on which is required or permitted by law to be denoted by an adhesive stamp affixed otherwise than by the Inland Revenue Department is not to be deemed duly stamped unless the person required by law to cancel the adhesive stamp cancels the same by writing on or across the stamp his name or initials, or the name or initials of his firm, together with the true date of his so writing, or otherwise effectively cancels the stamp and renders the same incapable of being used for any other instrument, or unless it is otherwise proved that the stamp appearing on the instrument was affixed thereto at the proper time.

*   "(2) When two or more adhesive stamps are used to denote the duty upon an instrument each of those stamps is to be cancelled in the manner aforesaid.

*   "(3) Every person who, being so required by law to cancel an adhesive stamp, neglects or refuses duly and effectively to do so in the manner aforesaid shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds."

#### Obligation on company secretaries

The authority given to sharebrokers to stamp certain transfers of shares with adhesive stamps will impose some obligation on company secretaries and others whose duty it is to register or record such transfers. This is imposed by Section 43 of the Stamp Duties Act 1954 which provides that, before transfers of shares or debentures are registered, the company and its officers must see that the transfers have been duly stamped.

The main point for company secretaries and others to observe is that transfers of shares may be stamped by a sharebroker with an adhesive stamp only if the shares have been sold through his agency for full value and for a price which does not exceed £20. The stamp duty involved in all such cases is 1/3.

### Application

4.  This standard applies from the date we publish the final version. It applies to all taxpayers and customers of Inland Revenue ("Customers") who wish to provide electronically signed documentation and information to Inland Revenue through Inland Revenue approved channels.
5.  Customers may only use an electronic signature when submitting documents and information to Inland Revenue where:
    1.  They are using Inland Revenue's online services; or,
    2.  They provide an electronic signature (whether directly or via a tax agent or other intermediary) using software that complies with the requirements set out in this standard.
6.  Customers submitting documentation and information under an electronic signature to Inland Revenue must comply with the conditions for the presumption of reliability set out in sections 228(1)(a) to 228 (1)(d) of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.

### Electronic signature

7.  An electronic signature must be provided with the signatory's consent.
8.  In accordance with section 228 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, the means of creating the electronic signature must be linked to the signatory, or other authorised person, and to no other person.
9.  An electronic signature also verifies that the information was submitted by a known Customer, or other authorised person, that the Customer cannot deny having affirmed the document or information provided to Inland Revenue and that the document or information was not altered in transit.
10.  Any alteration to the document or information after the time of signing must be detectable.
11.  The signatory is responsible for safeguarding their authentication credentials and the management of delegations they authorise.
12.  An electronic signature is the Customer's verification of the authenticity and accuracy of the information or documentation submitted to Inland Revenue.

**Non Repudiation of transactions submitted through third party software**

13.  Third party software providers must implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect confidential information that are no less rigorous than accepted industry practices, including the 'International Organization for Standardization's' standards:
    *   ISO 14000 series
    *   ISO 27000 series
14.  Third party software providers must ensure that all such safeguards, including the manner in which personal information is collected, accessed, used, stored, processed, disposed of and disclosed, must comply with applicable New Zealand data protection and privacy laws, as well as the terms and conditions of their contractual obligations with Inland Revenue.
15.  If the integrity of a transaction is questioned, the third party provider must be able to demonstrate the validity of the transaction on their system or intermediary systems.  
    The software must log authentication, time, and source details from online sessions for all transactions.
16.  The software's terms of use and privacy declarations must state that the end user is responsible for safeguarding their authentication credentials and the management of delegations they authorise.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

We’ll use the standard option for your provisional tax unless you choose otherwise.

If you use the standard option, you’ll pay 3 instalments during the year unless you're registered for GST and file 6-monthly GST returns. Then you'll only pay 2 instalments. 

Your instalments on the standard option are based on either of these uplifts:

*   your previous year’s [residual income tax (RIT)](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
     plus 5%
*   your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%.

The uplift to use depends on when you file your previous year’s return and whether you have an extension of time to file your return.

Work out which uplift you need to use for each payment, then calculate how much each instalment will be.

[Work out provisional tax using the standard option](/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option/work-out-provisional-tax-using-the-standard-option)

No extension of time to file your income tax return
---------------------------------------------------

If you don’t have an extension of time to file your return, your provisional tax will be your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. This includes if you file your return after any of your provisional tax dates.

When you have an extension of time to file your income tax return
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Calculate your instalments according to when your previous year’s return is filed.

### Return filed on or before the first provisional tax date

If you have filed your previous year’s return on or before your first provisional tax due date, you’ll pay 3 equal instalments during the year. These will be using your previous year’s residual income tax (RIT) plus 5%.

### Return filed after the first but on or before the second provisional tax date

Your provisional tax will be based on your RIT:

*   from 2 years ago plus 10% for your first instalment
*   from last year plus 5% for your second and third instalments.

If you file on or before your second provisional tax date, or the next working day if it falls on a public holiday or weekend, your provisional tax for that instalment will be based on your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. 

### Return filed after the second or third provisional tax dates

Your first and second instalments will be based on your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%.

Your final instalment will be based on your previous year’s RIT plus 5%. 

If you file after your final provisional tax date, your final instalment will be based on what you expect your previous year’s RIT to be plus 5%. This is because your return is expected to have been filed before your final provisional tax date. If your previous year’s RIT is different from expected, you will have paid more or less than needed.

Changing provisional tax methods
--------------------------------

You can change from the standard option to AIM or the estimation option at any time, but you cannot change to the ratio option during the same year.

Amendments to your previous year’s return
-----------------------------------------

If your previous year’s return is reassessed or amended within 30 days of one of your provisional tax instalment dates, your provisional tax instalment will not change. You will need to calculate it using the original assessment.

Filing your return for the current year 
----------------------------------------

You may have more tax to pay once you’ve filed your income tax return if your RIT for the current year is more than the provisional tax you have paid.

For people new to project planning, project planning training is recommended to help build the required competencies in this area. Schedule management is critical to managing delivery across the workstreams within the Programme. It is the aim of the following schedule management process to establish a clear and defined scheduling process for monitoring key milestones and deliverables across the Programme. Specifically, the process aims to: • prepare all schedules in the same format with appropriate interdependencies, linkages and logic • accurately report schedule information to all relevant stakeholders • ensure schedules aid the delivery of Executive-level reports and Business Transformation Programme direction to the Management Team • minimise the requirements for manual entry to management reporting on a weekly basis • ensure activities and deliverables drive the related dependencies throughout the Business Transformation Programme, and • anticipate, discover and report any milestone changes due to schedule movement from the baseline in a timely manner • present the critical path. 1.2 Overview of Scheduling Principles Level of detail • The schedules will track Deliverables and Activities • Will be scheduled down to WBS level 6 or 7 • Schedules will be based on real and timely information. Work Effort • Work effort will be tracked against activities • Work effort will not be driven from top down • Schedules will include time and work estimates that are based on reliable and benchmarked estimates for the same or similar activities. Resource Allocation • Role based resource allocation is available to use in schedules. Fixed date vs. Floating tasks • The practice of managing the dates associated with scheduled tasks will be via allocation of work effort and duration. Milestones • Milestones will be clearly outlined at the top of each workstream schedule • Tasks within the schedule that must be 100% for the milestone to be met. Dependencies Page 5 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Dependencies will be clearly outlined at the top of each workstream schedule • The schedule will track the dates and movement of dates associated with dependencies • Schedules will reflect the interdependencies between activities within the programme, and between the programme and other projects and initiatives • Dependencies will also be managed and tracked in JIRA. Schedule Performance (SP) • SP for workstream schedules will take into account all tasks (activities and deliverables) and will be based on % complete and the budget (planned effort) for a task • SP will be reported on completed and partially completed tasks based on the value of the task % complete. Critical Path • The critical path will be tracked and reported as an ‘informed’ critical path. Linking of workstream schedules • There will be no direct linkages between workstream schedules. Integrated schedule • The integrated schedule will be developed via a roll-up from workstream (child) schedules. 2 Roles and Responsibilities 2.1 PMO The PMO is responsible for: • mandating and documenting the standards to be used for constructing and maintaining all workstream schedules • creating the integrated schedule based on the workstream schedules • with coordinators and leads, facilitating shared understanding and agreement of identified dependencies, and accurately reflecting these in the integrated plan • with coordinators and leads, maintaining internal dependency links • with coordinators and leads, maintaining external dependency information • baseline workstream schedules • baseline the integrated schedule • facilitating regular review of the integrated plan with the coordinator team • reporting from the integrated schedule on overdue activities, critical path and critical dependencies weekly • providing support, advice and guidance to coordinators on scheduling as required • publishing the weekly Schedule Performance dashboard to the Programme Planning SharePoint site. 2.2 Workstream Leads / Project Managers Workstream Leads / Project Managers are accountable for: • the content of their workstream’s schedules, including agreeing to the baseline delivery dates • agreeing cross-workstream dependencies with their peers and recording these in the dependency register (JIRA) Page 6 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • identifying external dependencies and recording these in the dependency register (JIRA) • complying with standards and ensuring that the plan is updated weekly (Midday Thursday) so that they can be fed into the Workstream reporting • the change control process within the workstream, ensuring that early visibility is given when a need for the schedule to materially change is identified. 2.3 Project Coordinators Coordinators are responsible for: • assisting the leads / project managers, build the schedules with their input and to the documented standards • maintaining the information in the project schedules as per the documented standards, including ensuring that progress against planned activities is updated weekly by 12.00pm every Thursday • identifying cross-workstream dependencies and recording these in the dependency register (JIRA) • identifying external dependencies and recording these in the dependency register (JIRA) • scheduling regular planning meetings to validate the accuracy and currency of the plan information. 3 Project Schedule 3.1 What is a project schedule? The project schedule is the project plan expressed in time. It documents what tasks need to be done, how long each task will take, when to start and complete each task and who will do the task. A project schedule is the key project tool used to manage actual versus planned project performance in the following areas: • time • progress • dependencies. 3.2 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Each schedule will be set up using a similar structure. Doing this allows the PMO to maintain consistency across each workstream plan and allow a roll up to the Integrated Schedule. It is recommended to have no more than six levels of WBS. Page 7 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Here is an example of what a WBS might look like in a schedule: 3.3 Integrated Schedule The integrated schedule is a rolled-up view of the workstream schedules from level 2 to level 5 and will be used to inform the high-level programme plan.

In this scenario, it is expected that the MS Project schedule will have summary tasks that aggregate the detailed tasks in the operational tracker. Tracking Progress Detailed progress would be tracked in the operational tracker. The progress completed (as a percentage complete) would be entered into MS Project against the appropriate task. The EV calculation occurs against the progress marked in MS Project schedule. 3.5 Developing a project schedule There are various ways you can approach developing a project schedule, however each project will need to address the following questions or steps: 3.5.1 Naming conventions The Deliverable Name must be as it appears in the Deliverable Register maintained by the PMO, ‘Dxxxx Deliverable Name’, where xx xx is the D-number assigned, and, to ensure traceability and consistency across all programme artefacts. The summary task names for levels 1 to 3 should not be changed as these are used when rolling up to the integrated schedule. Page 9 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5.2 Calendars The schedule template will be pre-populated with the relevant public holidays, please see the Programme Planner if you need to modify the calendar for your workstream as this will need to be reflected in the integrated schedule. Schedules will use the Enterprise Calendar, “ NZ Standard”, (Project Calendar) as this has the public holidays loaded. Consider using elapsed duration (suffix ‘ed ’) in the duration column for continuous tasks, this will ignore the enterprise calendar. Leave for individual resources should not be tracked in the workstream schedules. 3.5.3 Constraints Constraints should not be used as a way to drive task dates. The only time that this is acceptable is when there is no logical predecessor to drive the task. Note: Manually entering a Start or Finish date or dragging and dropping a Gantt bar will create a constraint. 3.5.4 Schedule template A schedule template will be provided to give workstreams a base structure to work from. T his will include a WBS and the enterprise calendar showing public holidays. 3.5.5 Summary tasks Summary tasks should not have links or resources. 3.5.6 Task name Task names need to be descriptive. All detailed level tasks should contain a verb to define a concrete action. You will need to ensure that each task has a unique name (eg, use prefixes) and special characters should not be used in the task name. Every task name needs to make sense when read in isolation of its parent task but shouldn’t include too much information in the task name. Use the Notes function to record additional details if necessary. The lowest level tasks are the only ones with work, resources, duration etc assigned to them. 3.5.7 Task type Task types apply only to automatically-scheduled tasks, and come in three flavours: fixed units, fixed work, and fixed duration. Project looks at a task’s type to determine how duration, work, and units will behave as Project schedules your project. Task Types: • Fixed Units: This setting assumes the number of people assigned to the task (units) is known and you don’t want it to change, even if duration changes. When the work changes on a task, the duration changes, but not the number of people. This task type reflects most task realities in any project. • Fixed Work: This setting assumes work doesn’t change, even after changing durations or adding people. Use this setting if you want to control the duration of tasks by adding or removing people. • Fixed Duration: This setting assumes duration doesn’t change, even when more people are assigned to the task. Use this setting if you have a duration in mind for a task before you know other information about the task. Page 10 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 3.5.8 Task mode BT Schedules should be completely Auto Scheduled and driven by logic (predecessors, successors, durations, work). Auto scheduled tasks For Auto Scheduled tasks, Project will automatically set basic parameters, such as the duration, a start and finish date. While calculating these, MS Project considers the context and date constraints. The tasks will be recalculated by the Project Scheduling Engine every time something that affects this task in the project schedule changes. Creating tasks in Auto Scheduled mode is recommended for most tasks, because it minimises manual manipulations and can avoid scheduling errors that can occur in complex project environments. Avoid setting dates manually when arranging tasks , as this will apply a constraint and prevent the scheduling engine from doing its magic. Manually scheduled tasks This should only be used during the initial planning stages for the schedule and changed to “Auto scheduled” when planning is complete. If you create a task in manually scheduled mode, no calculations take place. Once set up, project will not move the task when re-calculating the project schedule. When hard parameters are clear you should replace the uncertain values and change the task mode to Auto Scheduled. Please note: Project Online has been set to not accept manually scheduled tasks when publishing. 3.5.9 Task Relationships - Linking A dependency is a logical cause-and-effect relationship between two tasks (ie, one task or activity is dependent upon another task or activity). Where a task or activity is dependent on another task or activity, a link is to be established between the two. Typically, this will involve setting the completion of one task as a predecessor to the start of another (Finish-Start). There are four types o f dependencies: Page 11 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Dependencies can have a lag time: Lags can be added to links, for example if there will be a delay between the finish of a predecessor and the start of the successor (such as where a document must be completed a number of days before the approval meeting due to the lead time required for papers to be submitted). It is sometimes helpful to have the Successor column visible in your schedule so that you can see which tasks and activities will be affected by any changes you make. If a task does not have a logical dependency with another task, and you do not want it to start on the default (project start date), enter the start date manually. T his will add the constraint type “Start No Earlier Than”. 3.5.10 Default Columns There are three columns the PMO uses, these are not to be removed. These have been added so the workstream schedules can be reported on at different levels of detail using filters. The default columns are as follows: Finish-Start (FS)Start-Start (SS) The most common type, this means task B cannot start until task A finishes (e.g., test the module after building the module). Task B cannot start until task A starts. Finish-Finish (FF)Start-Finish (SF) Task B cannot finish until task A finishes. Task B must finish before task A starts. Ta s k A Ta s k B Ta s k A Ta s k B Ta s k A Ta s k B Ta s k A Ta s k B ZeroPositiveNegative In a Finish-Start dependency, task B begins immediately after task A. In a Finish-Start dependency, task B waits a specified number of days after task A finishes. In a Finish-Start dependency, task B begins a specified number of days before task A finishes. Ta s k A Ta s k B Ta s k A Ta s k B Ta s k A Ta s k B Page 12 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Outline Level – displays the WBS level 1 to 6 this is used when rolling up to the integrated plan • Block Plan – Used to define which items are to be included in the workstream block plan • DEL ID – used to display the unique deliverable ID BTDxxx or MIL for key milestones 3.6 Task Estimation (How long will it take) Capture these details to populate the schedule: • Identify start and finish dates for each task and confirm these dates with the resource responsible for that task. • Group tasks in the sequence they will be completed. Check every activity is linked to another with its logic relationship. • Avoid making tasks too granular eg , hourly or too long, ideally tasks should be 1 or 2 days as the minimum and a maximum of one reporting period (10 days). • Populate the “Work” column with the estimated hours for each task or add roles from the enterprise resource list to calculate the work. 3.7 Baselines The PMO will be responsible for baselining all the schedules once the project tasks, dependencies and work effort have been entered into the schedule and agreed upon by all stakeholders. Note that all dependencies must be agreed before the schedule can be baselined. 3.7.1 Re-baselining post PCR The workstream will update the schedule to reflect the changes from an approved PCR and will advise the PMO of the changes in the schedule, the PMO will then re-baseline only the task that were modified or added. Re-baselining the entire work plan would provide inaccurate metrics. 3.8 Publishing and Saving When you have finished updating, always publish your schedule by selecting the “Publish” button in MS Project. Do not under any circumstances save the schedule with a new name or version number or in a different location. Always open and update the schedule from Project Online Do not download a copy and update it offline. Page 13 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 4 Managing Dependencies These guidelines cover the approach to be taken by the Business Transformation Programme with respect to the treatment of schedule dependencies. The management of dependencies ensures that: • an effective process exists for managing existing dependencies • new dependencies can be identified, and an action plan agreed and implemented • the impact of dependencies on the workstream plans is understood • there is effective communication between all the dependency-related parties • there is a clear focus and a clear definition of dependency ownership and management responsibilities • dependencies are integrated into the workstream plans and schedules, and the Programme master schedule, and clearly identified as dependencies • dependencies can be included and addressed as an integral part of the Programme monitoring and reporting. There are three types of dependencies: 1. Workstream level Dependency (Internal Dependency) – These are dependencies that a workstream has on the deliverable owned by another workstream. 2. External to BT Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with the deliverable owned by a team outside of the BT Programme but internal to IR. 3. External to IR Dependencies – These are dependencies that a workstream has with the deliverable owned by a party external to IR. De pendencies should be codified in project schedules (Gantt charts) with a DEL ID indicator of “BTD-xxx”. The “owner” of a dependency is the PM / workstream lead whom is supplying the content to the recipient. When workstream leads / PMs are planning their project they are required to “handshake” the details (from, to, content, date and impact) together and populate the data into the dependency register and their respective schedules. Refer to the dependencies guide “Dependencies in JIRA” for more information. The dependency register is located in Jira at the following location: https://jira.nsp.ird.govt.nz/projects/BTD/issues 4.1 Programme Level dependencies Programme-level dependencies will be documented in the integrated schedule. This includes the baseline set of dependencies identified as part of the current Baseline plan. Where a dependency meets any of the following criteria, it may be added to the BT programme schedule: • Change to an existing programme level dependency (eg, date / content) • Impact to a deliverable on the critical path • Identification of a new dependency relating to a Priority 1 deliverable; or • A dependency deemed “critical” to programme success. Page 14 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Changes to dependencies should be agreed between the respective PM / workstream lead and the BT Programme Manager / Programme Planner. At this point they will be updated in the programme-level dependency register and into the Programme Gantt chart. 4.2 Workstream level dependencies Dependencies other than those identified by the programme as part of the Baseline plans will be managed by the individual workstream in JIRA, and are the accountability of the respective project manager / workstream lead. All dependencies must be included in your workstream schedule and in the Dependency Register. 5 Managing and tracking When updating your Project schedule please consider the following points: • Do you need to adjust the task duration to complete the work? • Do the tasks dates still align with the baseline? • Have you confirmed the effort (work) for the task? • Does the schedule conform to the schedule guidelines? • Does schedule align with reporting requirements? • Do any timeline impacts need to be captured in a PCR? 5.1 Updating the Schedule Schedules must be updated weekly to align with reporting requirements. Update/review the following: 1. Set the Status Date to Friday of the reporting week 2. Does the task need to be updated? a. No – move to the next task b. Yes – Move to the next question 3. Has the task started? a. No - then move the task to a future start date b. Yes - Move to the next question 4. Has the task finished a. No - Move to the next question b. Yes - then update percentage complete as on track Page 15 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5. Is the task on track to finish? a. No - then review the duration and increase to move finish date and update percentage complete as on track b. Yes - Move to the next question 6. Is the finish date in the past? a. No – then move the incomplete part of the task to the status date OR review the duration and increase to move finish date and update percentage complete as on track b. Yes - then update percentage complete as on track Set Project Status Date Task has started? Upd ate % copmle te as ‘On Tra ck’ No Move task to n ew start date Yes Is task on track to end date? New task start date set to future date Increase the task duration to set the new finish date No N ew t a sk finish da te set Move the incomplete part of task to status d ate Task has finished? Yes Yes Incomplete part of task moved to future Task Updated Is the finish da te in the past? No Yes Task R eview Does the task need to be update d Yes Move to next task No No OR 5.2 Tracking Review the variances from the Tracking Gantt view. (select this from the Gantt chart button). This will show the baseline start and baseline finish against your actual progress. Refer to screenshot below: Page 16 of 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 5.3 Critical Path BT Schedules will use an ‘Informed Critical Path’. For information on this please see the PMO. 5.4 Closing After making updates to the schedule, do not forget to click “ Publish” and close the schedule to save your changes back to Project Online. 6 Reporting 6.1 Schedule Performance (SP) Reporting Schedule Performance ( SP) is the sum of the baseline work (measured in hours) completed for tasks by a specific date. When creating a plan, the following information must be captured (at the lowest task level): • Start Date • Duration • Work (Effort) • % Complete • Finish Date is calculated based on start date + duration. Note: Resources are not required for the calculation however resource roles can be assigned to tasks to calculate work. Once the plan has been baselined, the values entered above are locked and used for the SP calculation unless the task’s planned effort is changed and baselined in which case the revised effort is used. After the plan is updated, the following calculation is used to calculate SP eg, If a task’s % complete is greater than 0%, then EV (or Budgeted Work at Completion) is equal to planned effort. 7 Support /Feedback System Any feedback and assistance needed on MS P roject or Project Online, please contact the PMO.

Standout yearling threshold announced
=====================================

**24 January 2020**

Inland Revenue has released the price yearlings must be sold for at this year’s Karaka Yearling sales so they can be considered as ‘standouts’ and possibly eligible for tax deductions.

In 2018 the Government announced its policy that allows new investors, who purchase standout yearlings with the intention to breed them for profit, to be able to claim tax deductions as if they had an existing bloodstock breeding business.

Investors will also be taxable if the standout yearling is subsequently sold for a profit.

To qualify for tax deductions the standout yearling must be purchased at Karaka 2020 from Book 1 and cost more than $430,000 for fillies and $368,000 for colts.

To be eligible, investors have to provide Inland Revenue with evidence within 4 months of buying the yearling that they intent to derive a profit from breeding the high-priced filly or colt.

A yearling intended for breeding and purchased through a syndicate, or subsequently syndicated after Karaka 2020, also qualifies the new investor to claim income tax deductions under the policy.

**Information Required when notifying the Commissioner of an intention to breed for profit**

1\. Notification of intention to breed.

2\. Sale and Purchase documentation – (and, if not included in documentation, lot number/sale name/horse identification (colt/filly, dam/sire etc).

3\. IRD/GST Number of the owner. If multiple owners (syndicate/partnership) details of the entity, including all owners individually.

4\. Contact Details: Physical Address, phone number, E-mail address.

5\. Balance date.

6\. Owner’s founding documents (Syndicate/Partnership agreement).

Stapled stock
=============

Under the new rules, certain debt securities stapled to shares are to be treated as shares for most tax purposes.

_**Sections CD 22(9), DB 10B, DP 8(3), EX 5(5)(c), EX 9(6)(c), EX 30(6)(c), FA 2(4)(b), FA 2(5)(c), FA 2B, FE 15(1) and (2), FE 21(4B), HD 14(2)(a), and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections CD 14(9), DB 8B, DP 7(3), EX 5(5)(c), EX 9(6)(c), EX 31(6)(c), FC 1(4), FC 2(4B), FC 2B, FG 4(2)(b), FG 8G(1), HK 13(1), LF 2(3), and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004**_

Under the new rules, certain debt securities stapled to shares are to be treated as shares for most tax purposes.

### Background

The amendments are intended to bring tax rules up-to-date with developments in financial markets and prevent a potentially serious loss to the revenue base. Previously, using stapled stock instruments with debt components, companies could pay tax-deductible interest to shareholders as a substitute for dividends. The issue becomes particularly acute if the instruments are issued to foreign investors in New Zealand companies. The amendments ensure that when a debt instrument that would normally give rise to tax deductions is stapled to a share it will be treated as equity for tax purposes.

The amendment was added to the bill post-introduction through Supplementary Order Paper No. 224.

### Key features

*   Debt securities “stapled” to ordinary shares will generally be treated as shares rather than debt for most tax purposes.
*   The debt security component of the stapled stock instrument continues to be treated as debt under the thin capitalisation rules unless it is stapled in proportion to the available subscribed capital of all participating shares.
*   Key exclusions include debt securities stapled to the share before 25 February 2008, debts stapled only to fixed-rate shares, and debts of a non-widely held company stapled under a shareholders’ agreement.

### Application date

The new rule applies if the debt security was stapled to the share on or after 25 February 2008.

### Detailed analysis

#### _Debt securities stapled to shares are treated as shares for most tax purposes (sections FA 2B and DB 10B of the Income Tax Act 2007 and sections FC 2B and DB 8B of the Income Tax Act 2004)._

New section FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (new section FC 2B of the Income Tax Act 2004) applies to a debt security stapled to a share, if the share is not a fixed-rate share. This debt security is treated as a share for most tax purposes. For example, interest payments will be treated as dividends under the Act.

For the purposes of the rule, a debt security is defined as a financial arrangement that:

*   provides funds to the company;
*   would give rise to a deduction but for the new rule; and
*   does not arise only from a movement in a currency exchange rate or a non-contingent fee.

As a result of this limited definition, debt securities issued by a non-resident are not caught by the new rule unless the issuer has New Zealand income against which it could deduct the interest on the security.

##### _What is “stapled”?_

Under the new rule, a debt security is “stapled” to a share if it can, or ordinarily can, be disposed of only together with the share. Arrangements to which neither the company that issued the debt security nor the company that issued the share is a party are excluded.

The rule is also designed to exclude conventional “shareholder agreements” that limit separate trading of debt and shares in companies with small numbers of shareholders. A shareholder agreement is defined as an arrangement between shareholders of a company that is not a widely held company. The arrangement cannot be the company’s constitution, the terms of a debt security, or the terms of the company’s shares.

##### _What type of shares?_

The rule is only intended to apply to debt securities that are stapled to participating or ordinary shares. This is achieved by excluding debts stapled to a share that is a “fixed-rate”. A new definition of “fixed-rate share” is provided for this purpose.

##### _Debt security and share aggregated for certain purposes_

Under current rules, in certain situations, such as a share repurchase, a taxpayer is required to consider whether a share is a _non-participating redeemable share, fixed-rate share, or fixed-rate foreign equity_. When considering whether the stapled stock instrument meets one of these definitions, taxpayers are required to consider the stapled stock instrument as a whole. The two parts, when considered as one instrument, usually have the characteristics of an ordinary participating share, and so will not meet the definitions.

##### _The debt security under the thin capitalisation rules_

The debt security component of the stapled instrument will continue to be treated as debt under the thin capitalisation rules, except when it is stapled to shares in a _proportional-stapling company_ or issued to a non-resident. This is to prevent taxpayers using the new rule to circumvent the thin capitalisation rules.

A proportional-stapling company is defined as one in which:

*   each _participating share_ is stapled to a debt security; and
*   the available subscribed capital of each participating share and the amount payable for the issue of the debt security are in the same proportion for every participating share.

##### _Effects of “stapling” and “de-stapling”_

The available subscribed capital of a company needs to be adjusted appropriately for debt securities treated as shares under the new rule. The “stapling” of a debt security to a share is equivalent to issuing a share and the “de-stapling” of a stapled debt security is equivalent to cancelling a share. The definitions of “cancellation” and “consideration” have been amended to ensure that the same tax effects occur.

##### _Relationship to rules treating certain debentures as shares_

The new rule is similar to existing sections relating to “profit-related” and “substituting” debentures. An arrangement could, in theory, meet the conditions for both the new rule and one of the older rules. The older sections have been amended to clarify that only the new rule applies in such cases.
1 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] V1:00 BT Readiness Framework (forMain Releases and Other Initiatives) 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Readiness Framework Readiness forms part of the BT Deployment Strategy. The Readiness Framework has been developed to provide a singular approach and framework for stakeholders contributing to readiness assessment and release decision making. TheReadiness Framework is a decision support tool designed to provide status & visibility that the release is “where we planned to be” at a particular Checkpoint. Checkpoints 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The Readiness Framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness checklists, assessments and reports used at key checkpoints leading up to and during deployment for the main/major releases of the BT Programme •The Framework enables the release to assess progress and readiness to move from one stage of the deployment lifecycle to the n ext. •Readiness is assessed at each of the checkpoints against a specific set of criteria, with residual risk visible throughout.T he size, reach, functional spread and complexityof a releaseinfluencesthebreadth and coverage of thecriteria assessed. •These criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and release,co llectively reflecting the readiness of our Customers,Service Providers, People, Business Units and the Release Delivery team. •The cumulative impact of prior Releases, other business activity and environmental conditions is assessed. •The assessment allows for the exception reporting to be tailored for Business Unit, Programme and Customer. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.C riteria rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business. Light Amber rated criteria may also be included should these be assessed as required, discretion will be applied. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline and additional checkpoints will be added as required to provide both additional a ssessment and certainty for decision makers. •The Enterprise Risk Framework and RAG status definitions are used to provide a consistent, familiar and standard reference. •Checkpoint dates are aligned with delivery phase gates,s cheduled governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the programme status at the time. •Note: Readiness for smaller / shorter running initiatives will complete an initiative readiness assessmenta s part of theirgo-l ive preparation which will not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component. These assessments will be covered by specific criteria within the Initiative checklist. START Delivery – Main Releases Readiness Framework Overview 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] •The framework provides the structure and purpose for the readiness assessment and reports used at checkpoints during the delivery lifecycle. •Readiness is assessed against a specific set of criteria (contained in a “master” initiatives readiness checklist), at agreeddate s or checkpoints, with both plans to green if applicable and residual risk captured throughout. •The size, complexity and functional spread of an initiative influencesth e criteria assessed and the number of checks completed.The checklist is adapted to suit. Criteria are never deleted, rather a column is provided for initiative specific positioning of the criteria – how it applies or does not apply, to the specific initiative. •Criteria (or questions) are specific to a checkpoint and initiative,co llectively reflecting the readiness of the initiative to either commence the deployment (the go/no-go) or proceed from a key stage/control gate to the next. •The number of checks may vary from the minimum of one (1) check immediately preceding the go-l ive (the go/no-go) as part of the deployment preparation, to multiple checks leading up to the go-live (the go/no-go) check. The initiative charter will define the approach to be used. •The cumulative impact of business-as-u sual activity, other initiatives, prior initiatives andenvironmental conditions (e.g., an election, holidays, etc) is also assessed. •The initiative readiness checklist does not include a separate Business, Customer and People readiness component.T hese assessments are be covered by specific criteria within the initiative readiness checklist. •There will be an agreed checkpoint timeline, checkpoint dates will be aligned with delivery phase gates,s cheduled governance meetings, channel shutdown requirements, etc and the method will allow for additional decision meetings to be scheduled as required based on the initiative status at the time and to provide certainty for decision makers. •An Executive Summary is prepared which reports on an exception basis only.C riteria rated red, light red or amber are included, providing information to decision makers on the potential business and/or implementation risk, with visibility of the “go to green” plans and residual risk these hold for the business.

Readiness will vary by product and customer segment to recognise when the change needs to land with the customer, i.e., some readiness criteria extend beyond go-live. •Members of the External Stakeholder Engagement working group will review and endorse the assessment for each c heckpoint, including go to green plans where required.Customer segment leads will also review and provide feedback of the high-level assessment against criteria based on “where we expect to be” for each checkpoint. What’s different this release? Given the targeted customer groups impacted and smaller scale of the releases and initiatives in Stage 4: •No customer insight research is being conducted to inform the readiness assessment or marketing effectiveness, although th is will be conductedfor S4-1-R2 (child support and upgrading myIRto version 12). •Customer interaction testing of m yIRwill be reviewed and considered. •Customer readiness will be assessed against agreed criteria as reported by Community Compliance, Account Managers, P roduct Owners, Digital Ecosystem Team and others based on their interactions with customers and stakeholders using the risk RAG ratings detailed overleaf. Components of the Customer Readiness Assessment •Utilise metrics and data already collected including those relating to marketing & communications activities, for example, reach of direct mail, social media and advertising. •Reports via Account Managers (Account Managers, External Relationship Managers, Community Compliance and Significant E nterprises) against specific criteria on the readiness status of the customers, intermediaries and service partners they engage with. •Insights from Customer Design Validation into customers’ expectations of e-S ervices, including ease of use. •Assessment of known risks and issues. 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer ReadinessReporting At checkpoint 2 and 3, customerreadiness reporting provides the information required to satisfy the needs of the target audience to enable decision making e.g., customer readiness will beassessed by product and definedcustomer sub-segment. Checklist > Specific readiness criteria relevant for each checkpoint, agreed by the External Stakeholder Engagement working group. Enterprise Risk Framework Frameworksare used to define Current Status and Residual Risk Assess > Conduct assessment of evidence against the criteria for each Product before each checkpoint, including reasons if not green and go-to-green plan. Confirm assessment with the External Stakeholder Engagement working group and relevant Segment Leads. Report Summarise the point-in-time customer readiness assessment for each product, showing the RAG status, rationale and residual risk. It is important that to identify the “so what”. Thisallows the time to rectify prior to GoLive, or toensure that we “know what we areup against”should it be ahigh-risk area.This information alsofeeds intocontingency and Early Life Support planning. For any criteria indicating Light Amber to Redreport on: •Reason for not being Green •The Go to Green plan i.e., what activities are u nderway or planned to address reasons for not being green •The residual risk if the statusdo es not change, or deteriorates(using the Enterprise Risk Framework) 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] People Readiness Summary - 22- •The People Readiness Assessment is one component of the Readiness Framework.It assessessentiment and the comfort levelsof our people about the change coming i.e., "their hearts and minds".It is a component of business readiness which includes criteria about howpeople are feeling in general, with business readiness also including environmental criteria such as work on hand levels, burndown work, planning activities,prioritisation, recruitment activities, contingency plans and so forth. •Using lessons learned from previous releases, people readiness will still be assessed through in-person discussions and team surveys which enable valuable insight to be gathered from those directly impacted and allow themes to emerge quickly. •The assessment will be scaledto reflect the requirements of Stage 4, release 1, release 2 and other scope. •CCS Segment leads will review and provide feedback ofthe high-level assessment as part of the people and business readiness criteria for each checkpoint. •In addition to the report that goes to PGC, the results of the people readiness assessment will be shared with CCS Segment, Group and Team Leads to assist with their implementation planning. Components of the People Readiness Assessment Approach •“Close up” team interviews which are 30 minute discussions with the highly impacted teams using open ended questions to tease out themes and insights. Utilised mainly for those in Change Group A. •Team Surveys which are 6-7 minute surveys completed by the Team Lead following a team discussion based on a set of provided questions to assess the team's current level of awareness, understanding and readiness. Utilised for those in Change Group A and B). •Pulse Check Surveys which takes 1-2 minutes completed by a random sample of people from across the organisation to assess levels of awareness and understanding before go-live. Utilised for those in Change Group B andC). •Training uptake and insights (when training has commenced). 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Business Readiness Exception Reporting At each Checkpoint Business Readiness reporting provides the information required to satisfy the needs of the target audienceto enable decision making.

The go- live committee therefore needs to consist of the most senior IR leaders representing the business, technology and the programme. Go-Live Committee When is it convened? The Go-Live Committee will convene at the following scheduled times (tbc): oMonday 18 Oct -4a oCommence Cutover oWednesday 27 Oct – 4b oOr (will depend when cut-over starts) oTuesday 26 Oct -4b oGo-Live or Rollback oOpen Channels oIn addition, the Go-Live Committee needs to be “on-call” from Monday 18 October until Monday 25 October should an urgent decision be required. oAny such unscheduled meeting would be exceptionally rare and where possible all decision making will be done in the pre-scheduled meetings. 30 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Role: The Go-Live Committee will be responsible for making the following decisions: 1.Should BT begin cutover of the major release into production based on the Readiness Assessment Framework 2.Should BT stop, pause or delay the cutover of the major release into production because of a major incident affecting IR or the cutover 3.Should BT roll back the major release from production because the go-live criteria cannot be meet within the agreed change window 4.Should the major release go-live because the go-live criteria have been met meaning cutover is complete and Early Life Support can commence. Responsibilities: •To provide executive level decision making during the cutover of the major release. •Ensure all decisions are made in a timely manner to minimise impact to business operations and customer experience. •To ensure that decisions are made in adherence to approved entry/exit criteria, and in the best interests of IR. •To ensure consistent distribution of key messages related to the successful deployment OR to ensure consistent distribution of key messages regarding the rationale for rolling back unsuccessful changes.

A separate Tactical Communications Plan is being developed that details the tactics we will deploy t o enact this strategy. Document control Contact person Status 0.3 Document review history No Date Page Section Version Contact 0.1 7 July All All First draft • 0.2 3 August All All Second draft • 0.3 12 August All All Third Draft • 4.0 All All Sign off • Document signoff Area Name Signature Date II&C BT Communications Strategy Purpose To articulate the strategy to communicate to our customers, stakeholders and people regarding system availability and business shut down dates and times in the lead up to the implementation of Stage 4 START Delivery Release 2. 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] This strategy may be updated as new impacts are discovered. The Programme is striving towards an October go -live as planned, but are closely monitoring the impact of external events which may affect this timing, such as COVID lockdowns and the recent closure of our Wellington office. Any dates in this strategy may change as timing is confirmed after mock go-live 3 in September. Background To enable Stage 4 START Delivery Release 2 many of our systems need to shut down so the necessary data migration, testing and preparatory work can happen. This process – known as ‘Cutover’ – is currently expected to take place between 4pm on Thursday 21 October and 8am Thursday 28 October 2021. Please note, it will be a business decision as to the timing of the opening of the contact centres and front of house when system availability resumes. During cutover During cutover, myIR, our contact centres and customer facing offices will be closed. Customers won’t be able to access their information or perform tasks such as GST and other filing (other than making payments through their bank). What channels and services will be available? There will be no interruption to customers’ ability to pay IR via internet banking, and social media channels will be available during business hours only. Social channels will be monitored over the shutdown to identify urgent emerging issues only. Internally Haukāinga, Ātea Learning, email system, Teams, START training environment and Ātea will be available. Impacts There are a number of payments that will be made earlier as a result of the cutover. Also, prior to shutdown will be the last time most people will have access to FIRST. Payments Payments for Working for Families Tax Credits (WfFTC) and Paid Parental Leave due to be made during the cutover will be made earlier in some cases: WfF payments (Weekly/Fortnightly): If customers normally receive weekly/fortnightly payments on Tues 19 Oct (or Wed 20 Oct) this will not change. WfF (weekly) However weekly customers will receive their next payment in that same week, on Thursday 21 October (or Friday 22 Oct). This is the payment they would normally receive Tuesday 26 Oct (or Wed 27 Oct). This customer group will get paid twice in one week and not get paid the week we’re slated to closedown. PPL: If customers normally receive their fortnightly payment on Tuesday 26 th Oct (or Wednesday 27 th ), we will bring the payment run forward and they will receive their money on Thursday 21 st Oct (or Friday 22 nd October). 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The next fortnightly PPL payment would be as per the BAU schedule and would be disbursed to customers on Tuesday 9 th November (or Wednesday 10 th November). T his puts a three -week gap between payments. Additional comms to this group are planned for clarity. Child support receiving carers who are flagged as “early payers” in FIRST will receive their money early, as well as any arrears. A child support payment run will occur on both Wednesday 20 and Thursday 21 October. Most people will be paid overnight on Wednesday, so we will still have all our channels open on Thursday if we need to process urgent refunds, or if customers want to contact us or check their myIR account for payment details. The Thursday payment run will pick up anyone missed in the Wednesday run. Communications will be prepared to inform customers about the early payment event and making sure they’re aware of our closure immediately following their payment. Reactive communications will be prepared to support customers and reduce contacts in the event that they have queries about their payment (or there are payment errors). GST file rs – 28 Oct filing and payment date Monthly and bi-monthly GST payments, returns and provisional tax instalments are due by 28 October. This coincides with the current planned dates for the cutover outage period of 21 October to opening back up on the morning of the 28 October (TBC). This impacts approximately 500,000 GST filers who are set to file and pay GST on or just before Thursday 28 October 2021. To mitigate the impact, we will be communicating to this audience from the 1 October encouraging them to file early and alerting them to the shut-down period. As well, we’re preparing contingency plans (TBC) similar to previous cutovers including the option to communicate a grace period for filing and paying GST in the event that our systems are not back up and running before 28 October. This would require Commissioner approval but will be drafted as an option in the contingency plans. Employers Employers need to complete payday filing two days after paying their staff. We have plans in place for those impacted by these closure dates. We will encourage early filing and clarify that closure dates do not count as working days for filing purposes. We are confirming final details of messaging including making sure customers will not be disadvantaged by closure dates or changes to filing. These details will be included in our tactical and contingency plans. FIRST access As this is the final START release and all tax and social policy products will be in START, most people who have access to FIRST will lose it at the end of October 2021. FIRST will be in a read only state until the end of November at which point it will be shut down and handed over to the decommissioning team. A separate communications strategy is being delivered to our people about the decommissioning of FIRST. Timing Currently, Cutover is expected to take place between 4pm Thursday 21 October and 8am Thursday 28 October 2021. This timing will be communicated following the completion of mock go-live 3. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Key dates Date Event 5 – 16 July Mock Go Live 1 16 - 27 August Mock Go Live 2 13 - 24 September Mock Go Live 3 1 month before close down (24 September 2021) Service Update page is live Cutover messages go out via all channels to customers and stakeholders (details in tactical communications plan) From 4pm Thursday 21 October Cutover close down From 8am Thursday 28 October Go-live Timing of communications by audience group and channel\* We will start informing our audience groups of the service availability during the close down period as soon as the third mock go-live is complete.

Customer audience groups Customer groups who are more likely to contact us, or want to perform an action during the cutover period are detailed below: Audience group Why they might want to contact us Services unavailable during closedown period Services available during closedown period Tax professionals • Undergoing their daily work on behalf of clients • Urgent changes need to be made to client’s tax affairs • Their own tax affairs • COVID support/advice for clients (if applicable) • Specialist advice and help from contact centre • myIR • START Gateway Services (Income and Return Service APIs) • www.ird.govt.nz – intermediaries and other section of website • I R social media channels\* • Bank payments Businesses • GST returns and payments • Employment Information returns and payments managing their tax • COVID support/advice (if applicable) • EI or GST returns through myIR • Gateway Services (employers who use integrated software) • Specialist advice and help from contact centre • Front of house • Payments will be able to be made to IR via internet banking • www.ird.govt.nz • IR social media channels\* Employers • Employment information returns and payments • COVID support/advice (if applicable) • myIR • Gateway Services (employers who use integrated software) • www.ird.govt.nz • Payments will be able to be made to IR via internet banking • IR social media channels\* Social Policy customers – WfF & PPL • Urgent payment required • Need to update their details • Receive their payment details • General questions about their entitlements • Change in circumstances • Advice from contact centre • Checking their details and entitlements on myIR • Front of house • Urgent payment/chasing up incorrect or non- payment • Social media channels\* • www.ird.govt.nz 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Audience group Why they might want to contact us Services unavailable during closedown period Services available during closedown period Social Policy customers – Child support • Need to update their details • Receive their payment details • General questions about their entitlements • Change in circumstances • Advice from contact centre • Checking their details and entitlements on myIR • Front of house • Social media channels\* • www.ird.govt.nz New businesses • Incorporating through the Companies Office • Registering for IRD number • They may receive IRD registration details late (normally automated within 48 hours). • Front of house • Companies Office • www.ird.govt.nz General customers • Access myIR • Register for IRD number • For answers to general questions we get asked regularly. • Advice from contact centre • Checking their details and entitlements in myIR • FOH closed to customers – no appointments taken during the outage • IR social media channels • www.ird.govt.nz \*Note: On IR social media channels we provide information and answer general questions about tax and entitlements. We can’t answer questions specific to a customer’s situation because we can’t validate customers on social. We do not accept direct messages via social media channels. Social channels will be available over cutover for customers for reference only. These will not be updated during the cutover. However, they will be monitored to identify and respond to potential urgent issues if they arise.

During the close down, direct our customers to information or services that are available. Customers inundate our social media channels with requests and questions. Ensure out-of-hours social media monitoring for urgent issues is maintained and respond to any urgent queries that come through. Otherwise, pinned outage post will sit at top of social pages directing customers to our website for more information. Prepare standard responses and ensure we constantly update followers on what is available and also what we are able to answer via these channels. Keep media team updated on any potential or real issues as per normal process. Go live is only partially successful and system remains unavailable after the close down period. Mitigation to be managed by BT deployment team with communications support from Marketing & Communications. Update closedown landing page (ird.govt.nz/service-update. If cutover takes more time than expected, we can update this page and all of our channels to direct people here via the shortlink. This includes myIR outage page, webpage banner, social media channels and contact centre VRC. Use BT Account Management to get messages out to key stakeholders. Customers incur penalties due to late filing and they blame this on the cutover and not being informed. Impacted customers will also be reminded of due dates in advance. We will prepare a standard response to these customers and ensure our customer facing teams understand any mitigation measures implemented due to the cutover. Contingency plans prepared. Negative media coverage about close down. We will work with the media team to develop a robust set of Q&As and we will send out a proactive press release front footing the changes. Timeframes for the cutover period move Keep staff, customers and external stakeholders up-to-date with progress and expected timeframes. Prepare communications contingency plan to cover this eventuality – including full roll back. Child support, Working for Families and Paid Parental Leave payment Communications will be sent to this group in advance informing them of the change to 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] impacted by shutdown. Customers will receive their payment early but will then be unable to contact us or check anything in myIR for a week. their payment day. Messaging will be required over shutdown to reduce contact by customers wishing to query their payment during this period. This will be included in our tactical plan. The payments will be made in advance of cutover, allowing customers the time to log into myIR or get in touch with us if they believe something is not right. Monthly and bimonthly GST filers will be due on 28 Oct. This is roughly 500,000 customers. They won’t be able to use myIR during the outage period to file Communicate with these customers in advance, encouraging them to complete their returns prior to the shutdown. This is in line with BAU payment reminders currently employed via social and will be expanded to other channels TBC.

1 START release plan - sequencing options For discussion IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 2 Transformation is well underway ▪There are four broad stages in Inland Revenue’s transformation –digital services, tax, social policy and a final wrap up. ▪Transformation is enabled in the main by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. ▪Central to the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s technology is delivery of a new tax and social policy platform called START. ▪In addition to START, a number of other changes are being made to support digital services and intelligence-led outcomes. ▪GST was the first major release of START in February 2017. ▪From now on there will be more than one START release in each stage so that the amount of change being introduced for both customers and Inland Revenue can be carefully managed. ▪The remaining stages of transformation will overlap and be implemented in a series of START and other releases from 2018 to 2021. ▪Major START releases will typically occur on an annual cycle in each of the next four years to align with the beginning of the tax year. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 3 2016/172017/182018/192019/202020/21 Major Release 1 Customer experience ▪Self-service for GST End-to-end solution ▪GST ▪Foundational technology Major Release 4 Policy \*\* ▪Investment income filing (mandatory – 1.4.20) ▪Social policy changes (tbc– release 4 or 5) Customer experience ▪Improved digital submissions for KiwiSaverproviders ▪Improved self- service for KiwiSaverand Student Loans End-to-end solution ▪PAYE ▪KiwiSaver ▪Student Loans Major Release 5 Policy \*\* ▪Social policy changes (tbc– release 4 or 5) Customer experience ▪Improved self- service for child support ▪Full customer view available End-to-end solution ▪Child Support Stage 1 Enable secure digital services Major Release 2 Policy ▪Accounting Income Method (provisional tax –1.4.18) ▪Payday reporting (voluntary –1.4.18) \*\* Customer experience ▪Digital submission of employer information End-to-end solution ▪Withholding taxes ▪Fringe benefit tax ▪Payroll subsidy ▪Gaming machine duty ▪Automatic Exchange of Information Major Release 3 Policy \*\* ▪Payday reporting (mandatory –1.4.19) Reduction in PAYE electronic filing threshold Investment income filing (voluntary –1.4.19) ▪New annual income tax process ▪Individuals’ income tax (tbc–1.4.19 proposed) Customer experience ▪Digital submission & improved self-service for income tax ▪Improved self-service for PAYE End-to-end solution ▪Income tax, including provisional tax ▪Imputation taxes ▪Working for Families ▪Independent earner tax credit Stage 2 Streamline tax Stage 3 Streamline social policy Stage 4 Complete the future revenue system \*\* Subject to legislation being enacted and further discussion with Ministers regarding priorities IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 4 The current START release plan, in our view, best balances risk from both a customer and delivery perspective ▪There are some other timing options for some products. ▪Taxes must be moved to START before social policies to ensure that the income information these entitlements rely on is accurate and available in START. ▪End-of-year Working for Families processes will move to START with income taxes, as the calculation and financial management is highly dependent on information about family circumstances and family income information. ▪There are some deployment timing alternatives for the Working for Families processes that take place at the beginning of the year. •There are choices about the order we move Child Support, KiwiSaverand Student Loans in. •We have put forward a view based on current available information and completed a preliminary assessment of some other options. We will know more in September/October 2018 when we have more detailed information. •Until then, we recommend the current release plan as the best option. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 5 Options will be assessed against how well they deliver against Ministers’ priorities. They must: make it easier to make changes to tax and social policy including time to implement new products ensure revenue collection has a higher degree of certainty ensure social policy can be quickly directed at those in need Government priorities Alternative sequencing options for social policy are possible within some set parameters Options must be within the mandate approved by government. They must: not exceed the approved funding achieve benefits as early as possible end by December 2021 or earlier deliver all tax and social policy products in START enable the decommissioning of heritage technology enable Inland Revenue’s digital capability to be leveraged for the benefit of the NZ public November 2015 business case Options will be assessed against their risks and their impacts on customers and Inland Revenue. They must: minimise business risk –the ability to absorb change minimise delivery risk – implementation do- ability have the least impact on revenue have the best positive impact and least negative impact on our customers minimise coexistence costs –manual and technical Risks and impacts Options will be assessed against how much they improve customer experiences. They must: make it easier for customers to understand what their obligations and entitlements are and why reduce compliance costs for customers over time significantly improve customers’ experiences and enable them to self-help for the majority of the time mean there is little need for customers to contact Inland Revenue Customerexperiences IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 6 There are three possible options for sequencing Child Support, KiwiSaver, and Student Loans The options do not include Working for Families ▪Options for the optimum time to move Working for Families have already been considered. To minimise the difficulties for customers from having to work off both old and new systems and to ensure payments continue to be timely and accurate, Working for Families will move with income tax in START release 3. No option proposes moving two products in START release 5 ▪Should this be required, it could impact our ability to complete transformation by December 2021. The work completed by \[Information redacted\] on the EMS process confirms that Child Support can be decoupled from PAYE – so option 1 is viable ▪Decoupling Student Loans from PAYE can be done with some impact. Decoupling KiwiSaverfrom PAYE will have a big co-existence impact. ▪These options all assume PAYE processing moves in release 4.

The key markers that will trigger a reassessment of the release plan are: 1.Government priorities will be clearer following the 2017 General Election. 2.The successful implementation of START release 2. 3.The completion of income tax solution design and definition (for START release 3) in START, and Working for Families solution design largely completed. This will give us a gauge of how easy or difficult it is to implement social policy products in START, and how much can be re-used from the Working for Families solution design to support KiwiSaver, Child Support and Student Loans. 4.Business system testing for START release 3 has begun. 5.An early diagnostic on how Child Support, KiwiSaverand Student Loans will work in START has been completed. Until these have been completed, we will not have sufficient information to reassess the current START release plan. The START release plan will be reviewed at the conclusion of each START major release, or at least yearly, to ensure the sequence remains relevant. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 10 Operating two core tax and social policy systems means operational risk has increased due to co-existence ▪Co-existence (the need for old and new systems to work together) is amongst the most complex challenges to be managed for both us and customers. Ideally, we ensure that customers are not aware of the two different systems. ▪Migrating products and services to START as quickly as possible will limit the time that systems need to co-exist, is the best way to manage risk, and will minimise any confusion or disruption for customers. ▪The priority is delivery of the core tax and social policy platform –START. ▪Only by improving and modernising our technology can we significantly enhance experiences for customers and meet their needs. ▪Halting part way through implementation will increase operational risk, be costly because two core systems will have to be supported and maintained, and may potentially constrain government’s agility to make change. IN CONFIDENCE - EXTERNAL RELEASE 11 Metric Current Plan Option1 Option 2–Reverse Child Support & Student Loans Option 3 –RescheduleKiwiSaverto Release 5.0& Student Loans / ChildSupport to Release 4.0 Rank & Rationale Scope All products will be delivered within confirmed programme scope for all three options Risk – Technical Low Moderate Conceptually, reversing child support & student loans drives a very low level of difference into the design and underlying technical risk for the co- existence solution. This ranking reflects that we have not performed analysis at the same level of detail as Option 1 to confirm coexistence technical implications. High Moving KiwiSaver to Release 5 means separating it from PAYE processing in Release 4. This would drive a significant increase in technical coexistence complexity and the number of returns processing and financial integration points that would need to be developed between START and FIRST. Release Sequencing Options –Co-existence Impact Assessment Based on the release sequencing options, this table outlines a comparative view of technical risk and delivery cost associated with the required co-existence solution (for non-START applications). This is expressed as: (a)Qualitative risk ranking: degree of risk (1 = lowest →3 = highest), or; (b)Cost, expressed as an approximated factor of baseline funding.

=============================================================================================================================================================================================

What

Different ways employers can get their employees started with KiwiSaver

When

Each time a new employee starts work

New employees and the IR346K form
---------------------------------

For every new employee you'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form.

You can do this in myIR or download and complete it. You need to send it to us either: 

*   before your employee's first pay day
*   with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay.

To fill in the form you’ll need your employee's:

*   name
*   KiwiSaver status (if required)
*   IRD number and tax code
*   contact details
*   date of birth (if they've given you it).

### Using the IR346 for KiwiSaver employees

If you're enrolling your employee into KiwiSaver you use the IR346K form to enrol them. (You can also use the form to tell us if they have income exempt from KiwiSaver deductions.)

Automatically enrolling and opting in differences
-------------------------------------------------

Most of the time you automatically enrol new eligible employees into KiwiSaver. But some employees do not get automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver when they start. These employees ask to be in KiwiSaver. Choosing to join is ‘opting in’.

There's a difference between an employee who opts in and one who automatically enrols. The difference is employees who:

*   were automatically enrolled by you can choose to leave KiwiSaver. It’s called ‘opting out’.
*   opt into KiwiSaver cannot choose to opt out later.

Automatic enrolments into KiwiSaver
-----------------------------------

You must automatically enrol new employees aged over 18 and under 65. But not when your new employees are already in KiwiSaver.

[Enrol employees into KiwiSaver](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/starting-employees-in-kiwisaver/auto-enrol-employees-into-kiwisaver)

New employees already in KiwiSaver
----------------------------------

If you start a new employee who's already a KiwiSaver member, ask them to fill in a KiwiSaver deduction form - KS2.

Your employee uses the KS2 to tell you:

*   the rate they want you to make KiwiSaver deductions from their pay
*   they’re on a savings suspension. You’ll need to see their suspension notice before stopping their KiwiSaver deductions.

[Suspending KiwiSaver deductions and contributions](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/contributions-and-deductions/suspending-kiwisaver-deductions-and-contributions)
 

Employees who opt into KiwiSaver
--------------------------------

There are some employees who you do not have to automatically enrol into KiwiSaver. If they’re eligible, they choose to opt in. These are:

*   existing employees
*   new employees you cannot automatically enrol. For example, because of the type of employee they are, such as casual or temporary employees.

For every employee who opts in you'll need to fill out a New employee and KiwiSaver details - IR346K form.  
  
You can do this in myIR or download and complete it. You need to send it to us either: 

*   before your employee's first pay day
*   with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay.

To fill in the form you’ll need your employee's:

*   name
*   KiwiSaver status
*   IRD number and tax code
*   contact details
*   date of birth (if they've given you it).

if the employee is getting earnings that are exempt from KiwiSaver deductions use the form to tell us.

[Employees who choose to opt into KiwiSaver](/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-employers/starting-employees-in-kiwisaver/employees-who-choose-to-opt-into-kiwisaver)

Employees who do not tell you their age
---------------------------------------

Employees might not give you their date of birth. Some may also give you wrong information. This makes it hard to know if:

*   they’re eligible for KiwiSaver contributions
*   if you need to automatically enrol them. 

In either case, automatically enrol your new employee. We do not penalise you. If their enrolment is a mistake, they can opt out later.

Starting principle open justice
===============================

2015 case note – High Court finds starting principle of open justice - name suppression, confidentiality, publication.

Case

Jawahar Bhaskar Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 1584

Legislative References

Judicature Amendment Act 1972, High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court dismissed Mr Musuku's application for an order that a judgment (where he was the applicant) not be published, or that his name, other identifying information and sensitive information in the judgment not be published. Woodhouse J held that the starting point is open justice and that more is required than to point to adverse consequences of publicity.

### Facts

Mr Musuku unsuccessfully brought judicial review proceedings against the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") (_Musuku v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2015\] NZHC 678).

Having lost, Mr Musuku sought an order either that the judgment not be published or that his name and other identifying and sensitive information in the judgment not be published.

### Decision

Woodhouse J, in an oral judgment, first assessed the authorities and, citing the leading authority on name suppression in tax cases _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ ((2004) 21 NZTC 18,894 (CA)) ("_Muir_")_,_ emphasised that the starting point is the principle of open justice and the Court does not start on the basis that there is a right to privacy which stands equally with that principle.

His Honour referred to two Court of Appeal decisions which appeared to differ on name suppression in civil cases:

*   _Clark v Attorney-General_ (\[Name suppression\] 17 PRNZ 554 (CA)) ("_Clark_") where it was held that exceptional circumstances are required for name suppression in a civil case, and
*   _Jay v Jay_ (\[2014\] NZCA 445, \[2015\] NZAR 861) ("_Jay_") where it was held that "extraordinary circumstances" are not required.

The Court of Appeal in _Jay_ did not conclude that _Clark_ should not be followed and Woodhouse J did not need to determine which decision should be followed to the extent there is a material difference. His Honour held that that the starting point is open justice, as was made clear in _Muir,_ and that more is required than to point to adverse consequences of publicity.

One of Mr Musuku's concerns was the reference to the Commissioner's opinion under s 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that his tax returns were fraudulent or wilfully misleading for the purposes of the time-bar not applying. Woodhouse J recognised that the allegation of fraud in civil proceedings is a serious matter and this was Mr Musuku's strongest point in terms of adverse consequences.

However, His Honour noted that Mr Musuku had chosen to bring the application for judicial review in the High Court where the general rule is no anonymity.

Additionally, there was no up-to-date evidence pointing to any particular adverse consequences of publicising Mr Musuku's identity, other than the broad inferences one might draw in respect of family members.

Counsel for Mr Musuku argued that publication of Mr Musuku's name was unnecessary and not something that the open justice principle requires. This argument was rejected on the basis that, as set out by the Court of Appeal in _Clark_, the Court should not engage in an evaluation of public interest factors and a grading of which matters should, or should not, be reported.

The application was dismissed.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

State-owned banking groups
==========================

Alteration to the thin capitalisation rules permit Kiwibank be treated separately from the rest of the New Zealand Post group. Applies 1 Jul 2009 onwards.

_Sections FE 2(5), FE 36(1), FE 36B and YA 1_

The thin capitalisation rules have been altered to permit the Kiwibank group of companies to be treated separately from the rest of the New Zealand Post group. This is to reduce compliance costs and to ensure that the appropriate thin capitalisation test is used for the non-banking part of the New Zealand Post group.

#### Application date

The changes apply for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2009.

This measure applies retrospectively.

#### Key features

The thin capitalisation rules have been altered so that:

*   a state-owned banking group (the Kiwibank group of companies) is not subject to the thin capitalisation rules by reason of New Zealand Post's non-banking activities; and
*   the New Zealand Post group may exclude the Kiwibank group of companies from its New Zealand group, so that it will apply the ordinary thin capitalisation rules rather than the thin capitalisation rules for banks.

These alterations apply only so long as the Kiwibank group of companies is not subject, in its own right, to the thin capitalisation rules (for example, by directly acquiring a controlled foreign company).

#### Detailed analysis

All references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless stated.

#### _Background_

The thin capitalisation rules, which limit excessive interest deductions against the New Zealand taxable income of multinationals, were extended in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009.

Previously, they applied only to non-residents and residents controlled by non-residents. After the 2009 Act, they also applied to other taxpayers with controlling interests in foreign companies.

The New Zealand Post group has such controlling interests, so is newly subject to the thin capitalisation rules.

Because of the way the existing rules work, every New Zealand member of the group is subject to the rules, including Kiwibank. Because Kiwibank is a registered bank, the entire group must apply the special subset of thin capitalisation rules that apply to banks.

This requires undertaking costly calculations for the non-bank members of the group (for bank members the calculations are based on information that is already produced) and allows debt to be, roughly, 94% of assets. This might be an appropriate ratio for a bank, but is unusually high for the significant non-banking operations of the group (75% is the standard ratio for New Zealand-based groups without a registered bank).

#### _Changes to rules_

The law has been changed so that a New Zealand state-owned banking group can be treated separately from non-banking activities in the same group.

_Subsection FE 2(5)_

Subsection FE 2(5) removes the requirement for a member of a state-owned banking group, to which section FE 36B applies, to take into account CFC or FIF interests held by associates outside the group (such as under sections FE 38, FE 41 or EX 15).

In effect, this removes Kiwibank from the scope of the interest apportionment rule in section FE 7 so interests held by non-banking members of the New Zealand Post group no longer need to be counted. However, it only removes Kiwibank from this scope because no member of the banking group currently has its own interest in a non-portfolio FIF or CFC. If a member were to acquire such an interest, all members of the group would be within the scope of section FE 7 again.

_Section FE 36 and 36B_

The definition of a New Zealand banking group has been altered so that, in the exclusive case of a registered bank that is 100% owned by the New Zealand Government, the group consists of:

*   the registered bank;
*   a company with a direct 100% voting interest in the registered bank; and
*   entities that are part of the financial reporting group for which the registered bank is the reporting entity, or would be part of it but for relevant materiality thresholds. The terms "financial reporting group" and "reporting entity" are defined by the Financial Reporting Act 1993.

This isolates the Kiwibank group from the rest of the New Zealand Post group. Without the alteration, the entire New Zealand Post group including Kiwibank would be treated as a New Zealand banking group.

The isolation relies on the definition of a New Zealand group for a company that is not part of the Kiwibank group. Paragraph FE 28(1)(c) excludes members of a New Zealand banking group from that New Zealand group (a New Zealand banking group exists despite the non-application of section FE 7 to that group). In other words, that company's New Zealand group will be all the New Zealand-based entities in the New Zealand Post group except those in the Kiwibank group. That company will therefore use the standard apportionment rule in section FE 6 and not the banking rule in section FE 7.

The new rule in section FE 36B may not apply in certain situations. Specifically, a member of the New Zealand banking group (determined as if section FE 36B applied) may have interests in an offshore company that would bring it within the scope of section FE 2, even ignoring interests of associated persons outside the group under sections EX 15, FE 38 and FE 41. If that is the case, the existing rules in section FE 36 are invoked. (To prevent circularity, subsection FE 2(5) is ignored when deciding whether or not section FE 2 would apply.)

That is, if a member of the Kiwibank group had an interest in a controlled foreign company or certain interests in foreign investment funds, the entire New Zealand Post group would again be a New Zealand banking group.

1 Excludes remeasurement of $13.254 million (2021–22: $2.743 million). The remeasurement consists of foreign exchange losses mainly on forward foreign exchange contracts, and macroeconomic changes in the actuarial valuations of retiring and long-service leave.

2 Revenue-dependent appropriation (RDA). The amount of an RDA is limited to the amount of revenue earned. 

3 A portion of the 2021–22 Transformation appropriation funding was returned to the Crown and $35 million transferred to financial years 2022–23 and 2023–24 to the new Residual Activities Following the Transformation Programme’s Substantive Closure appropriation. 

4 PLA refers to appropriations established under a permanent legislative authority. 

5 The revised budget figures for 2022–23 are those included in The Supplementary Estimates of Appropriations and Supporting Information for the year ending 30 June 2023. 

6 Since The Estimates of Appropriations for the Government of New Zealand for the Year Ending 30 June 2024 were published, this forecast was increased as part of the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update 2023 by $22.100 million to reflect updated capital investment plans.

The budget and forecast figures have been prepared in accordance with NZ GAAP, using accounting policies that are consistent with those adopted in preparing the departmental financial statements.

Explanations of significant variances against budget are detailed in the relevant notes of the departmental financial statements.

All of the 2022–23 performance information for each appropriation administered by Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue has been reported in the section on Our Performance.

A recent survey of Asia-Pacific countries ranked New Zealand’s tax system very highly because our tax policies are seen as clear and relatively simple. Our broad-base, low-rate system is coherent and relatively free of distortions. This is good for business and growth. It gives the clarity and certainty that business requires. I do not envisage major changes to the basic tax frameworks as they are fit for purpose. It is however important to keep maintaining the tax system, ensuring that our tax laws continue to be effective. This requires a constant process of tax changes supporting our broad-base, low-rate system. Tax policy work will therefore focus on improvements within the current framework aimed at supporting the Government’s intention to ensure fairness in the tax system and its objectives for the economy. But there are challenges ahead. Looking ahead, we can see that a more connected world will have increasing consequences for tax and tax policy. These include new products and business models and increased international trade, consumer choice and competition. Tax jurisdictions around the world are grappling with questions about fairness with regard to taxing large multinational corporates working across borders. As more and more New Zealanders shop online, there are questions about the tax implications of the digital economy. And there are implications for Inland Revenue itself. A tax system is more than tax policy. A good tax system comprises good tax policy supported by good tax administration. New Zealanders now expect to do almost anything online, including managing their tax affairs. While much of Inland Revenue’s efforts in this area until now have necessarily been focussed on planning, the department has now reached the stage where it can focus on the high level design of proposals. This is an important and exciting turning point for the department as it turns its mind to designing a tax administration fit for the 21st century. I am satisfied the information on strategic intentions prepared by Inland Revenue is consistent with the policies and performance of the Government. Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue 5 ird.govt.nz CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY In signing this statement, I acknowledge that I am responsible for the information contained in the Statement of Intent for Inland Revenue. This information has been prepared in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989. Naomi Ferguson Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue 6 COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION ird.govt.nz COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION 7 COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION ird.govt.nz COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION An exciting opportunity stands before Inland Revenue as we begin to implement business changes on an unprecedented scale. Many New Zealanders have probably heard of our intention to replace our ageing computer systems, but few are likely to be aware of the vast sweep of the reforms accompanying the introduction of this new technology. It will be nothing less than a once-in-a- generation overhaul of our tax system. We are aiming, to make it easier for people to deal with us, to offer new ways to reach us. We aim to get away from paper, to get more people managing their own tax affairs, preferably online or using mobile technology or through third-party service providers. The goal is not just to provide a better and more convenient experience for our customers, but also create systems that lower customers’ compliance costs and give them more certainty that their tax information is correct and protected. Over the past few years, we have been working behind the scenes on this transformation. We have been reviewing our policies, looking at legislative barriers to the impending changes, designing reorganisation processes, working out what specialist skills and capabilities our staff will need to run our new tax system, and identifying private sector partners to help us on the road to being a 21st-century tax administration. We are now ready to move to the design phase. We are about to choose a design partner with international experience in tax system change. During the next four years, we will streamline how we collect income and business tax information. Specifically, there will be a simpler PAYE system, which can be built into software businesses use to manage tax requirements. The system will also correct data errors automatically. There will also be improvements to our online service, myIR, as well as the introduction of more mobile apps to simplify access and speed up response times. This will happen in stage one. In the next three stages, there will be equally exciting changes. Areas we will look at include a rationalisation of withholding taxes and better alignment of tax and social policy payments. The details of later changes have deliberately been left open while we hold discussions with a range of businesses, individuals and interested parties. That way, we can be sure our new way of working will fit customers’ needs for many years to come. This focus on transforming for tomorrow must not, of course, be at the expense of continuing to deliver today—and deliver in ways that are more efficient and more linked up with services other government agencies provide. We intend, for example, to enhance our website, expand services through third parties, improve the way we use information and intelligence, tackle fraud and the hidden economy in more targeted ways, and improve how we manage debt. We will also give priority to ensuring we implement administrative changes to child support by the new deadline of April 2015. We are actively involved in the Better Public Services effort by government agencies to cooperate more closely, particularly where we have customers in common. Examples of this include parents being able to apply for IRD numbers for their child when they register their births, information-sharing agreements, sharing office space with other agencies, aligning ICT programmes and digital services, and using cross-agency contracts for services and systems. We will continue to look for such opportunities to make the taxpayer’s dollar go further. As well, we are lending support to another of the Government’s Better Public Services goals— rebuilding Canterbury. The huge amount of economic activity there means we are putting extra effort into supporting tax compliance. Our tax policy work in the next four years will focus on encouraging a strong and competitive economy, and protecting the tax base. Profit shifting by some multinational companies poses a potential risk to our tax base, and we will continue to work with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on this global problem. We have a challenging programme of work to complete over the next few years. There could hardly be a more exciting time to lead Inland Revenue, and I look forward to delivering changes that will have great practical benefit for our customers and for New Zealand. Naomi Ferguson Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue Part 1 OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT 8 OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT PA RT 1 ird.govt.nz 9 PART 1 OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT ird.govt.nz NATURE AND SCOPE OF OUR FUNCTIONS OUR PURPOSE Inland Revenue contributes to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our outcomes are: "Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. "People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. We are New Zealand’s principal revenue agency, collecting about 80% of core Crown revenue. We also have an important role in administering social policy programmes, often in conjunction with other government agencies. Both of these main roles are administered under Vote Revenue. FIGURE 1– SCOPE AND SCALE OF INLAND REVENUE’S ACTIVITIES 2012–13 Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. " Revenue collected$53.8 billion " Student loan repayments$1.1 billion People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. " Working for Families Tax Credits paid$2.6 billion " KiwiSaver funds distributed to scheme providers $3.1 billion " Child support payments distributed to custodial parents $226 million " Paid parental leave payments distributed $165 million OUR ACTIVITIES In 2012–13 our tax customers included: Individuals—1.2 million customers filed annual tax returns Employers—195,000 employers filed over 2.0 million employer monthly schedules Companies—420,000 companies filed returns GST payers—630,000 registered customers filed 3.0 million GST returns. Social policy programmes We manage or share the administration of: "Working for Families Tax Credits—we administer the programme jointly with the Ministry of Social Development. We distribute $2.6 billion in entitlements to support working families. "Child support—we collect child support payments. In 2012–13 we collected $435 million from 179,000 paying parents and distributed $226 million to custodial parents 1 . "KiwiSaver—we administer the scheme by collecting contributions and transferring them to scheme providers for investment. In 2012–13 we distributed $3.1 billion to scheme providers on behalf of 2.1 million members. "Student loans—we jointly administer this programme with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). In 2012–13 we had 711,000 borrowers. "Paid parental leave—we make payments, for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, to parents who take leave from their job or business to care for a baby. In 2012–13 we made $165 million in payments to 26,000 applicants. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE To meet our strategic intentions we manage our functions and operations through the following groups: "Policy and Strategy—undertakes policy development, forecasting and analysis, tax law drafting and strategic planning "Service Delivery—provides information and education, and carries out compliance activities. This group is the main point of interaction for customers making payments and filing returns "Office of the Chief Tax Counsel—provides technical taxation advice, rulings and dispute review services "Information, Intelligence and Communications— manages corporate and customer information, data analytics, customer intelligence, and internal and external communication "Change—supports the Investment Board to determine our investment portfolio, ensures its delivery, and develops and maintains our enterprise architecture "Corporate Integrity and Assurance—provides corporate support and service functions, including governance, legal, risk, assurance, procurement and the Christchurch Rebuild programme "Performance, Facilities and Finance—delivers financial and planning services and manages our facilities "Technology Strategy and Operations—delivers IT operations and services "People and Culture—delivers human resources services. 1 The balance goes to the Crown to offset sole parent benefits paid to custodial parents by the Ministry of Social Development. 10 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT We operate in a dynamic, complex environment and our planning takes into account the challenges set out below. MAINTAIN GOVERNMENT REVENUE During the global financial crisis and the 2008 recession, tax revenue declined and our debt portfolio increased significantly. Since then, tax revenue has recovered and moderate economic growth is expected to continue. The reconstruction of Canterbury and New Zealand’s increasing trade and investment relationships with Asia, the fastest-growing region in the world, are important contributors to economic growth. Like all developed countries, New Zealand will need to respond to domestic and international threats to our revenue base from tax avoidance and tax evasion. The increased complexity of global business operations requires Inland Revenue to be actively involved in international solutions to protect revenue. For example, we participate in the OECD-led work on tax base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals 2 . We also help by implementing government policy changes that support New Zealand’s fiscal position and competitiveness in international markets. REDUCE OUR ADMINISTRATION COSTS Operating within our baseline will be a challenge as our costs increase each year. We are reducing our administration costs through better management practices and targeted improvement initiatives. At the same time, we are improving our services and implementing tax and social policy changes. We need to do this while managing risks associated with carrying out our core business, maintaining the integrity of the tax and social policy system and implementing our Business Transformation programme. This programme is a multi-year series of business-led and technology-enabled improvements that will fundamentally change how we operate. WORK ACROSS GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE SERVICES We are working closely with other government agencies to deliver the innovative and effective public services that government and our customers expect. We will link more of our customer services with those of other government agencies to provide a seamless service. For example, parents can now apply for an IRD number for their babies when they register the birth with the Department of Internal Affairs. There will also be more cross-agency information sharing. This will be balanced against the need to protect customer privacy and the integrity of the tax system. RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES OF AN INCREASINGLY DIGITAL WORLD We need to keep pace with rapid technology changes, the expectations of our customers, their increasing digital literacy and access to mobile devices. We will enable our customers to manage their own tax affairs in a more cost-effective way through digital channels. We will create a “digital border” that ensures most information from our customers and intermediaries is digital and validated on receipt. IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION WE USE TO MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS We hold a large amount of data and information. We recognise that this is an important asset and we can improve the way it is managed and analysed. Enhancing our use of information and developing intelligence from customer data will enable us to better understand our customers, make evidence-based management and policy decisions, and use our resources more effectively. Our new coordinated information, intelligence and communications function will help us do this. IMPROVE THE RESPONSIVENESS AND AGILITY OF SYSTEMS Our ability to quickly and cost-effectively implement government initiatives is constrained by our core ICT infrastructure, FIRST. Our technology systems were originally designed for tax administration. It has become harder to implement major initiatives, particularly social policy changes, using our business processes and core systems infrastructure. Implementing our Business Transformation programme, together with rationalising, consolidating and simplifying our information, communication and technology environment, will help address this challenge. RESPOND TO THE CHANGING CUSTOMER BASE AND WORKFORCE An ageing population will have economic costs and affect potential revenue. The make-up of the country’s population is changing, with increasing representation by Asian and other migrants, who have different service needs. As we understand these population changes, we will respond by developing the capabilities, skills and organisational culture required to meet customer needs. 2 Shifting profits across borders to take advantage of tax rates that are lower than in the country where the profit is made. 11 PA RT 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz Part 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS 12 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz Our long-term strategies are designed to respond to our challenges and guide us towards the organisation we want to be. IR for the future outlines our long-term intentions. It is our guide for what we want to be as an organisation and how we get there. It describes our role, outcomes and goals—see below. FIGURE 2– KEY ELEMENTS OF IR FOR THE FUTURE What we are here for We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money Our success is reflected in two outcomes: Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. What we want to be A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence We work with customers and other organisations to make compliance easy and to give New Zealanders confidence that everyone pays and receives the right amount. To be recognised for service and excellence we aim to achieve the performance goals that define a world-class revenue organisation. These are: Speed Certainty Compliance Value OUR STRATEGIC INTENTIONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS To help achieve IR for the future, we will focus on three main areas: "implementing our transformation change agenda "contributing to government policy and priorities "delivering and improving our core business, including enhancing the customer experience. We will work in these three linked areas concurrently, balancing our need to deliver today and transform for tomorrow. IR FOR THE FUTURE 13 PART 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz IMPLEMENTING OUR TRANSFORMATION CHANGE AGENDA We are changing the way we deliver our services. We will do this through our Business Transformation programme and by changing our culture and workforce. We will engage with businesses, software providers and tax professionals. HOW WE WILL CHANGE Business Transformation is a business-led, technology-enabled change programme to implement the infrastructure and capability that will underpin a modern revenue system. This will enable us to: "improve agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective way "deliver more effective and integrated services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies "improve productivity and reduce the cost of providing our services "make it easier for our customers to interact with us "increase our intelligence and risk assessment capability to better target non-compliant behaviour "increase the secure sharing of intelligence and information across government to improve delivery of customer services and improve public sector performance "implement a technology platform that is scalable, flexible and reliable. Introducing new processes and a new technology platform will be lengthy and complex. At the same time we must also continue to collect revenue and disburse payments, and meet our commitments to delivering better public services and the Government’s tax and social policy work programme. Our roadmap Our Business Transformation programme roadmap sets out the starting point for the programme and its overall phasing. We plan to deliver the programme in four customer-focused stages: "Stage 1: Enable secure digital services—this will allow most of our customers to self-manage and reduce businesses’ compliance burden in fulfilling their PAYE and GST obligations. "Stage 2: Streamline income and business tax processes—this will build on the foundations laid in the previous stage and further reduce businesses’ compliance burden. "Stage 3: Streamline social policy delivery—this will improve the delivery of the social policies we administer. "Stage 4: Complete delivery of the future revenue system— this will include moving any remaining management and administration of tax and social policy to a new platform and decommissioning technology platforms that are no longer required. FIGURE 3– STAGES OF OUR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME Enable secure digital services Streamline income and business tax processes Streamline social policy delivery Complete delivery of the future revenue system Indicative timeline Y1Y2Y3Y4Y5Y6Y7Y8Y9Y10 1 Enable secure digital services 2 Streamline income and business tax processes 3 Streamline social policy delivery 4 Complete the delivery of the future revenue system New Zealand’s future revenue system is to be delivered in four stages Stage 1 This stage will lay the foundations for future work. It will take the initial steps needed to improve our business processes, data management and organisational capability, together with building the first parts of our new technology platform. Stage 1 will have three workstreams: "Strategic "Foundational "Tactical Strategic workstream The strategic workstream will include the business processes and technology changes required to start replacing our FIRST system with a new tax and social policy technology platform. These will streamline the PAYE system and improve GST information collection. The design phase will identify technology solutions and business processes for all our products, systems and services, including a single source of data. This workstream also includes policy work to identify any legislative barriers to customers moving to digital channels. We will also draw on the work undertaken to support Better Public Services results 9 3 and 10 4 and will help shape the design of the future revenue system. Foundational workstream Our foundational workstream will include preparing data for migration and integrating current and new technology platforms, which are typically complex and time-consuming activities. This work is required irrespective of the preferred technology solution and will begin in parallel with the design phase. 3 Result 9: New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business. 4 Result 10: New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment. 1234 14 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz Tactical workstream The tactical workstream will deliver improvements to the functionality of myIR (our secure online service) to provide a seamless service to customers. It will also remove the need for customers to file a “nil” GST return, and deliver new applications for mobile devices. These enhancements will help us maintain and improve our current services. Stage 1 will allow most customers to manage their own tax and social policy obligations. We will provide more digital services and more opportunities for two-way interactions between our systems and software used by third parties. We will also implement a digital border, which will mean customers and intermediaries can be certain we have accepted their information because we have validated it. Other benefits will include: "less manual processing "fewer customer contacts "reduced compliance burden for businesses to meet PAYE and GST obligations "improved data accuracy "more certainty about the amount of income tax deductions and social policy entitlements and obligations for individuals. Future stages Stage 2 will involve the streamlining of income and business tax processes. Key outcomes will include: "further reductions in the compliance burden related to fulfilling income and business tax obligations "less processing for income and business tax "less need for customers to contact us about income and business tax "improved compliance through better information about, and analysis of, customer behaviour "improved system performance and reliability. Stage 3 will focus on streamlining the administration of our social policy. Key outcomes will include: "streamlined and digital processes for the social policies we administer "less processing for social policy entitlements and fewer customer contacts "targeted compliance activities aimed at high-risk, high-return areas "improved system performance and reliability. Stage 4 will complete the delivery of the future revenue system. This process will include moving any remaining management and administration of taxes and social policies to a new platform, and decommissioning platforms no longer required. Policy implications Improving the customer experience to make it easier and simpler for our customers will require significant policy-related work over the life of the Business Transformation programme. Stage 1 will focus on the provision of secure digital services for businesses, including smoothing the provision of PAYE and GST information. Stage 2 will examine the policy settings for income tax and business tax processes to simplify administration of these taxes. Stage 3 will look at streamlining the delivery of social policies we administer, such as child support and Working for Families Tax Credits. Stage 4 will transfer the remaining management and administration of tax and social policy to the new platform. All this work will be subject to the usual public consultation process. 15 PART 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz CHANGING OUR CULTURE AND WORKFORCE Changing and streamlining the way we deliver our services, mainly through greater use of digital and online services, will have an impact on our people. As we move towards greater application of technology and streamlined processes, we will make corresponding changes to our workforce composition. To prepare ourselves for this, we are designing frameworks and systems to help reshape our organisational capability. Change leadership and capability Effective change leadership is essential to delivering the goals of IR for the future. A core competency for all our leaders will be the ability to be more agile, adaptable and open to new ways of working. We are reviewing our leadership framework and approach in 2014 and will redesign our leadership programmes during 2015. We will manage the challenges and risks associated with our Business Transformation programme through our organisational change management function. Workforce strategy A detailed assessment and understanding of our current and future workforce capabilities will ensure that we have the skills required for our future business. During 2014–15, we will review our people-related programmes and initiatives, including our: "workforce strategy "leadership framework "talent management approach "culture strategy. This will help us develop our people-related systems that support our transformation outcomes. Culture Inland Revenue needs a work environment that encourages and supports more productive, engaged employees, and also one that features strong leadership, innovation, clear accountability and sound risk management. IR for the future sets out the need to continue to develop and change our organisation’s culture based on the following shared values: "Trust and integrity—we act with integrity, honesty and professionalism. This ensures that we continue to be one of New Zealand’s most trusted organisations. "Valuing people—we treat each other and our customers with respect. "Innovating to make a difference—we keep finding new ways to lift our performance and make compliance easier. "Working together—we work together and with other organisations to deliver better services and value. Our leaders will focus on maintaining and improving our culture and staff engagement while we transform. 16 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz We have a responsibility as a government agency to contribute to the Government’s priorities. These are to: "responsibly manage the Government’s finances "build a more competitive and productive economy "deliver better public services within tight fiscal constraints "rebuild Canterbury. We will also continue to participate in a range of all-of- government activities, and collaborate with other agencies to reduce costs and improve efficiency and effectiveness. RESPONSIBLY MANAGE THE GOVERNMENT’S FINANCES Our responsibility is to collect revenue to support funding of government programmes by ensuring that our customers comply with their tax obligations. In 2012–13 we collected $53.8 billion, about 80% of core Crown revenue. The tax policy work programme helps the Government achieve its fiscal, economic and social objectives. The reconstruction of earthquake-damaged Canterbury is playing an increasingly important part in the expansion of New Zealand’s economy. It is essential we protect revenue due to the Government from the rebuilding effort, which will cost about $40 billion. We also administer social policy programmes, often with other agencies, including child support, student loans, paid parental leave, Working for Families Tax Credits and KiwiSaver. We are responsible for ensuring people receive their correct entitlements. BUILD A MORE COMPETITIVE AND PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY We need to ensure New Zealand is an attractive place to do business and invest in because New Zealand is a participant in the global economy. We also need to strengthen tax rules to ensure overseas companies pay their share of tax in New Zealand. Our tax policy work helps develop a more competitive and productive economy. Part of the work in this area will focus on continuing our participation in the OECD-led response to the global problem of base erosion and profit shifting by some overseas multinational companies. Proposals are scheduled to go to an OECD subcommittee in late 2014. Meanwhile, we will continue working on projects to strengthen domestic rules on international tax. Our tax policy work over the next four years will include: "taking forward the Government’s proposal to cash out research and development tax losses in the income year they arise in "considering the tax deductibility of capital research and development expenditure "considering how to preserve the benefit of loss offsetting for shareholders of non-wholly owned groups "considering simplifying technical and base maintenance matters applying to closely held companies "reviewing whether tax pooling rules operate as intended. We will implement legislative changes during the next four years. Approved policy changes include: "Child Support Reform "the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Inland Revenue is responsible for collecting and distributing child support payments. The first phase of changes to the scheme, embodied in the Child Support Scheme Amendment Act 2013, was scheduled to take effect on 1 April 2014. However, the complexity of the reforms and the flow-on effects for us in administering them necessitated a one-year delay in implementation. This was approved by the Government in December 2013. Legislation to enable the deferment was enacted on 27 February 2014 by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Legal and policy work will be necessary to ensure these changes occur smoothly and on time. Inland Revenue is also actively involved in work to secure an inter-governmental agreement with the United States over its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. This legislation requires foreign financial institutions to give United States authorities details of accounts held by American citizens, tax residents and others. As part of preparations for an agreement, we are assessing the legal and policy implications of such a move. DELIVER BETTER PUBLIC SERVICES WITHIN TIGHT FISCAL CONSTRAINTS We have an important role to play in improving services for New Zealanders. We play a key role in the Better Public Services programme, the delivery of the Government’s ICT Strategy, all-of-government services and other cross-agency initiatives. We will incorporate our contribution to them into the design and development of the Business Transformation programme where it makes sense to do so. We are continuing our focus on delivering greater value for money and doing more with less. CONTRIBUTING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PRIORITIES 17 PART 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz We will continue to work on initiatives that contribute to Better Public Services results 7, 9 and 10. Result 7—Reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime and youth crime. We share information in accordance with the law to prevent crime and fraud, and explore ways to reduce duplication between agencies. Result 9—New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business. Result 9 is about creating a better environment for business growth and “one face of government” for our business customers. To support this, we are exploring options for the New Zealand Business Number and we continue to participate in developing the result 9 strategic direction and roadmap. We are developing integrated business-facing services. Result 10—New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment. Result 10 is about making it easier to interact with government agencies through digital channels. The Government has set a target of completing 70% of common government transactions in a digital environment by 2017. We are committed to delivering three of our common transactions digitally—filing individual tax returns, paying individual tax and applying for an IRD number. We will continue to: "promote our online services and encourage customers to file and pay online through a range of activities "explore opportunities for a digital service for people to apply for an IRD number "participate in the design and development of the result 10 blueprint. We are also involved in developing the strategic direction for results 9 and 10. Government ICT Strategy The Government ICT Strategy focuses on using information and technology to deliver better services to New Zealanders. By 2017, the aim is to enable individuals and businesses to connect with government services through digital channels, joined-up services and technology that will function across agencies. The digital and information strategy and its associated actions are reflected in our plans. In line with the Government’s ICT Strategy, we will use all-of- government services where they are available and where they fit with our Business Transformation programme. For example, we are working with other agencies to explore the feasibility of collecting payments and disbursing money as an all-of- government service. We will continue to work with other government agencies to enable more effective information sharing between government agencies and with third parties by helping to simplify the management and control of agency data interconnections. Specifically, we will be: "providing services digitally and managing information as an asset "using common government capabilities where they are available and suit our purpose "supporting government business rules capability. Contributing to other all-of-government activities We are involved in other all-of-government activities. We will continue to work with other agencies to identify where we could adopt new and improved processes and services used elsewhere in the public sector. Co-location We have successfully shared locations with other government agencies. This has reduced our operating costs and enabled our customers to access a joined-up government service in one location. This approach has provided an opportunity to learn how other agencies operate. We will continue to explore further opportunities to collaborate with other government agencies. Procurement We are participating in the Government’s new streamlined procurement rules, which have changed the way it does business with suppliers by making agencies’ procurement practices more consistent and business-friendly. The new rules promote a value-for-money approach to procurement, which means that rather than just getting the lowest price, we will consider total cost of ownership and other benefits. All-of-government banking services Our banking contract with Westpac has been in place for 10 years. During this time the banking requirements of government have changed considerably. We are working with Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) which are leading an all-of-government solution to meet the Government’s current and future banking needs. This solution will provide access to economies of scale, better value for money, process efficiencies and better interaction for financial payments between government, business and taxpayers. 18 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz REBUILD CANTERBURY The reconstruction of New Zealand’s second-largest city is a priority for us. Providing joined-up government services in Christchurch We will continue to work collaboratively with other government agencies in Christchurch. For example, we are developing a joint procurement approach for major government-funded projects with MBIE and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. We will continue to develop cross-agency compliance solutions. We will work with the Ministry of Justice to identify opportunities for collaboration and sharing resources during the development of the Justice and Emergency Services precinct. Improving compliance in Canterbury We have staff and other resources dedicated to ensuring GST and PAYE obligations are met in Canterbury, especially by new businesses. We have also identified potential compliance risks stemming from the large number of temporary migrant workers brought in to help with the reconstruction of Christchurch. Over the next few years, we will increase our activities in this area, reinforcing our compliance work, raising our visibility in the Canterbury community and strengthening local relationships with industry associations, funding distributors, insurance companies and government agencies. We will also allocate more auditing and account management resources to identify non-compliance. 19 PART 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz Implementing our Business Transformation programme will be our top priority but this will not be at the expense of our core business. Throughout our transformation work, we will continue to improve day-to-day services within the limits of the funding we receive. Over the next four years we will enhance our existing services to improve: "the customer experience "compliance "business efficiency. Our areas of focus are detailed below. IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE We want customer interactions with us to be as convenient and easy as possible. We will continue to do this by enhancing and expanding our services. Customer satisfaction Helping customers understand their obligations and entitlements, and ensuring they are satisfied with our services, contributes to voluntary compliance. In 2012–13, a total of 92% of customers were confident we were doing a good job, and satisfaction with our online services was also high, with 94% of customers satisfied and 78% very satisfied. We are committed to maintaining our customer satisfaction levels and we will improve our services to meet customer needs. Digital services Our customers increasingly expect to interact with service providers using digital channels. We will provide new ways of getting information to our customers to meet their changing expectations. We will continue to use YouTube videos to make it easier for our customers to understand how to meet their obligations. We will continue to enhance our online services, particularly our mobile services. We also plan measures to encourage greater use of eUptake GST and eUptake payments. We will connect our digital services to third parties, including tax software providers, banks and tax agents. This will let our customers, who already work digitally in their business, seamlessly access our services. We will continue to introduce mobile applications for our customers and implement digital uptake measures such as eStatements and eNotices. Switching incoming customer information to digital formats is one area where we expect to make more progress. In 2014 we achieved this for digital returns (89%) and digital payments (84%). Registrations for our voice ID service reached one million in 2014 and are growing steadily. We will move towards our goal of 70% of GST-paying customers using the eGST service by 2017. The percentage of GST returns filed online continues to grow. IMPROVE COMPLIANCE A key aspect of our core business is helping to maximise voluntary compliance. We assist customers who are willing to meet their compliance obligations but are unaware or uncertain about how to do so. Influencing voluntary compliance, targeting inadvertent non-compliance by providing information, assistance and tools, and detecting and deterring deliberate non-compliance are part of our core activities. Smarter use of data and intelligence Smarter use of data and intelligence will enable us to carry out earlier interventions. We will continue to improve the way we use tools to analyse our data and data from other sources to identify and predict risks. We will improve our compliance intelligence to provide better intelligence-related services to other agencies. We will update our information strategy in 2014–15 to ensure that it aligns with our Business Transformation programme. Understanding and influencing customer behaviour We undertake work to understand and influence customers’ behaviour so it is easier for them to meet their obligations and receive their entitlements. During 2014, we will redesign our compliance model so it assesses a more comprehensive range of factors influencing customer behaviour. This work will enable us to design a wider range of approaches to improving compliance. The new model will show how customers’ behaviour relates to their capabilities, motivations and opportunities. It will help guide decisions on the best approach to take to influence customer behaviour. Dealing with non-compliance Our customers need to have confidence in our ability to address non-compliance. This encourages compliance and maintains confidence in our tax system. The majority of our customers file and pay on time. There are areas of the economy, however, where we must continue to pay particular attention. The hidden economy is one area where our efforts have produced positive results. In Christchurch, for example, we are identifying areas of the local economy where small businesses are using cash transactions to bypass their tax obligations. We expect to expand our work in this area, using risk-based assessments, as reconstruction work gathers pace in the city. DELIVERING AND IMPROVING OUR CORE BUSINESS 20 NEW ZEALAND INLAND REVENUE STATEMENT OF INTENT 2014–18 ird.govt.nz Our work on addressing non-compliance in the property sector has been successful and we will continue our focus in this area. Another area of focus is aggressive tax planning. Our work here is well on track to reaching its multi-year target. We have strengthened the integrity of the tax system through successful litigation, which has significantly reduced the scope for tax avoidance. We will continue to identify and take action in relation to schemes designed to avoid or significantly reduce tax liability. Managing debt Managing overdue debt is another area where we will continue to focus considerable attention. Measures to prevent debt and, where necessary, acting early to manage it, have proved successful and will be continued. We will concentrate on new debt with a high probability of recovering sizeable outstanding amounts. Lessons we have learned through recovering debt from overseas-based student loan borrowers will be applied to other areas such as child support debt. To help minimise the number of customers missing payments for income tax, student loans and Working for Families Tax Credits when they fall due, we are sending text messages and letters reminding individuals and businesses of the deadline. This is proving successful. We will use online advertising, including Facebook, Google and Twitter, to reinforce that message. We will continue to focus on early intervention with customers who incur new debt and customers who fail to keep up with instalments. We have achieved a higher-than-targeted return on investment, and will continue to use this approach. We are improving the collection of older debt and outstanding returns through a combination of case management and campaigns. We will continue to select cases with a potential for cash recovery and apply tailored interventions to them. We have achieved a higher-than-targeted return on investment, and will continue to apply this approach. The number of outstanding returns continued its recent downward trend. Outstanding returns by companies often involve large amounts of tax, and we will pay closer attention to them in future. The debt of overseas-based borrowers remains disproportionately high at 87% of total student loan debt. Our initiative to target non-compliance by overseas-based borrowers has consistently achieved returns above target. In 2013, we resolved more child support debt cases than in 2012 and we intend to accelerate this progress. About two- thirds of overseas-based parents who are not meeting their child support obligations live in Australia. In 2013, we signed an agreement with the Australian Department of Human Services to pursue payments on our behalf. We are also piloting legal action direct from New Zealand. IMPROVE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY We will continue to increase the value for money we deliver through improving our processes, strengthening our capital asset management, maintaining our ICT environment and reducing property overheads. Improve our processes We run an operations management programme to make processes more efficient and improve customer services. This gives frontline managers the skills, tools and processes to manage their work and lead their teams as efficiently as possible. In 2014, we will extend this into our investigations and advice areas. These areas provide auditing services as well as legal and technical expertise. We expect to make efficiency improvements of at least 15% by late 2017. Capital asset management The need to change the way we operate means that most of our capital investment over the next four years will go into the Business Transformation programme. We will also need to set aside sufficient funds to maintain existing services and infrastructure. To strengthen our asset management, we will update and consolidate our asset planning policies into an asset management plan. The increasing use of “as-a-service” solutions, particularly for ICT, will be considered in relation to our asset management planning and funding. Maintain our ICT systems and infrastructure We will invest in ICT systems and infrastructure so we can meet government and customer expectations for better, smarter and more cost-effective services. In 2014–15, we will develop an ICT strategy—aligned with the Government’s ICT strategy— and associated plans that will determine how we rationalise and simplify our ICT environment. The strategy will be closely linked with our Business Transformation programme and will provide a foundation for developing investment business cases to ensure we continue to maintain the integrity of our tax and social policy system. 21 PART 2 STRATEGIC INTENTIONS ird.govt.nz Maintain our property leasehold portfolio We will continue to reduce our property overheads to lower our running costs. We want to make the best use of existing office space and move where we can find better accommodation for comparable or better rates. Another option, and one increasingly used in response to Better Public Services goals, is to share offices with other government agencies where possible. Over the next four years we will either complete leasehold improvement projects or negotiate new premises. By June 2018, all premises will have a National Building Standard rating of more than 67% and meet a B-grade quality standard. Part 3 RISK MANAGEMENT 22 RISK MANAGEMENT PA RT 3 ird.govt.nz 23 PART 3 RISK MANAGEMENT ird.govt.nz MANAGING OUR RISKS Inland Revenue recognises that risk management is an important element of good governance and management practice. Inland Revenue uses an Enterprise Risk Management approach to managing risks to the organisation in the strategic, operational, programme and project environments.

OUR OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK Our outcomes framework sets out what we want to achieve. It shows how we intend to organise and use our resources to deliver services to New Zealanders, and contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. We must provide the best value for money from public funds. The framework shows how we carefully consider the relationship between our resources, outputs and impacts to ensure we stay focused on delivering value for money. Three elements contribute to this: "Economy—getting and using our resources as economically as possible "Efficiency—producing more for the same or less "Effectiveness—operating in a way that achieves our outcomes. FIGURE 5– OUR OUTCOMES FRAMEWORK Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society More customers register and report accurate information when required More customers claim their correct entitlements More customers pay and file information on time The behaviour of non-compliant customers improves More customers self-manage We improve compliance by ensuring: Compliance improves if:We address non-compliance so: Services to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations Services to process obligations and entitlements Management of debt and outstanding returns Taxpayer audit Policy advice We retain, develop and attract high- calibre people with the skills required in the future – enabling a culture of service and excellence We proactively influence voluntary compliance and address the causes of compliance risk and threats through a range of interventions We move customers to cost- effective channels while creating an environment to make it easy for customers to self-manage We improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government through working with other agencies and private providers We use our information to make timely decisions and build an intelligence-led organisation Our systems meet current and future needs Responsibly manage the Government’s finances Build a more competitive and productive economy Deliver better public services within tight financial constraints (results 9 and 10 – improving interaction with government, and result 7 – reducing crime) Rebuild Canterbury PeopleSystemsAssetsProcesses Government priorities Our outcomes The goals we are aiming to achieve Our impacts The difference we want to make Our outputs The activities we do Our inputs The way we use our resources Our priorities The key areas we will direct our effort and resources to Value for money Effectiveness Efficiency Economy 27 PART 4 MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE ird.govt.nz 5 See ird.govt.nz for details of our impact indicator and output measurement methodology. 6 We report on this indicator to provide additional contextual information. Employers’ correlation is between the number of employers who register for PAYE and the percentage of the labour force that is employed (from the Statistics New Zealand Household Labour Force Survey). 7 We report on this indicator to provide additional contextual information. This measure highlights a link between consumer spending and the amount of GST assessed, showing the completeness of information provided by GST customers. No target has been set because this is an indicator that is beyond our influence. 8 Payments are considered accurate if customers’ total yearly payments are within 20% of their entitlement. The accuracy of payments is primarily a reflection of the quality of information provided to us by our customers. 9 We report on this indicator to provide more context. The Working for Families Tax Credits correlation is between the number of customers who receive payments from Inland Revenue and the number of households with dependent children (from the Statistics New Zealand Household Labour Force Survey). 10 We report on this indicator to provide more context to gauge if customers are claiming donation rebates. It looks at the relationship between donation rebates claimed from Inland Revenue and donation levels recorded at the Charities Commission. IMPACT INDICATORS Our outcomes framework includes the impact we want to achieve in the next four years. Our current set of indicators shows the effect our activities are having on customer compliance behaviour. We have established baseline data and set targets through to 2018. In setting targets we have taken into account: "our strategic intentions, including transformation "our operating environment, including government priorities, the economy, our resources and customer expectations. Figure 6 shows the impact indicators we will report against in our 2015 Annual Report.

We report on how well we deliver tax and social policy services to our customers using performance measures and targets. We have 53 measures grouped into six output classes: "Policy advice "Services to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations "Services to process obligations and entitlements "Management of debt and outstanding returns "Services to other agencies "Taxpayer audit. Our output measures cover timeliness, quality, quantity and cost (see appendix 1). Activity forecasts (see appendix 2) estimate customer demand for our services and provide context for our output measure results. Each year, we review our measures and targets to make sure they continue to reflect the range of services we provide, changes in our operating environment and feedback from external stakeholders, including Audit New Zealand. MEASURING OUR EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS We measure our effectiveness through: "our impact indicators (see figure 6) "evaluating our work programmes. We evaluate the results of policies and major business projects against their objectives. The findings help us to understand what contributed to their success or what can be improved. We will continue to evaluate the social policy changes in student loans and child support. We will also evaluate our progress towards achieving the targets for Better Public Services result 9. We will continue to participate in the OECD’s comparative information study. This study compares tax administrations and provides detailed operational and costing information, as well as highlighting developments in international best practice. We expect the next study’s results will be available in 2015. We measure our cost-effectiveness by monitoring the average cost of our high-volume customer interactions (see figure 7). 29 PART 4 MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE ird.govt.nz FIGURE 7– COST INDICATORS Indicator2012–132013–142014–15 ActualTa r g e tTa r g e t Cost per telephone contact$29.02$31.00$36.00 Cost per correspondence contact $38.31$41.00$45.00 Cost per counter contact$61.44$45.00$65.00 Average cost per customer- initiated contact $32.92$34.00$40.00 Cost per income tax return processed $5.14$5.20$6.50 Cost per GST return processed $1.27$1.60$2.00 Cost per employer monthly schedule processed $4.67$6.20$7.75 Average cost per return processed $3.78$4.00$5.00 Cost of finalising an overdue return $9.13$15.00$12.50 Costs have increased due to overheads from the Business Transformation programme, the Child Support Reform and other anticipated baseline changes. MEASURING IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMME We will measure our progress towards implementing the Business Transformation programme through: "Ministers’ satisfaction "weighted time and cost to implement policy "percentage of correct customer obligations received on time "percentage of social policy customers receiving accurate and timely payments "cost to serve customers "customer perception of dealing with Inland Revenue— “Makes it easy to get it right” "reduction in customer tax compliance burden (expressed in hours) "outcomes achieved from information sharing and security of information "general perception—“You can easily access Inland Revenue” "customer-facing system availability. We will complete further work on these measures as we develop business cases for our Business Transformation programme. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES (EEO) Inland Revenue is committed to implementing the State Services Commission’s Equality and Diversity: New Zealand Public Service Equal Employment Opportunities Policy. We will report annually on our progress.

This is achieved through a range of proactive and reactive services to make people aware of their entitlements and obligations, and the services available to help them comply. This output expense also contributes to confidence in the tax administration system through managing individual customer complaints quickly, fairly and in confidence. It also provides services to Ministers to enable them to discharge their portfolio (other than policy decision-making responsibilities). What is intended to be achieved The purpose of this output expense is to promote confidence in the tax system and associated social policy programmes. Providing customers with relevant information and advice, certainty in relation to the application of the law, and a choice in how they engage with Inland Revenue will give customers increased understanding of their obligations and entitlements. This will contribute to achieving Inland Revenue's desired impact of more customers self-managing. Services provided to Ministers support them to fulfil their responsibilities to Parliament and the New Zealand public.

We achieve this through services designed to achieve timely, efficient and effective assessment and processing of: "tax payments, tax credit claims and refunds for taxpayers "entitlements for social support programmes. What is intended to be achieved The purpose of this output expense is to increase customer confidence in the tax system and associated social policy programmes. When customers have confidence they are more likely to self-manage their compliance obligations, register and report accurate information, claim their correct entitlements, and pay and file information on time. Processing obligations and entitlements in a timely, efficient and effective way provides value for money and contributes to the availability of revenue to fund government programmes.

This involves all activities associated with collecting outstanding returns and overdue payments, and taking appropriate action, including providing people with assistance on the actions they need to take to meet their obligations. This includes collection on behalf of other agencies and external parties. What is intended to be achieved This appropriation is intended to increase funding available for government programmes through the collection of revenue owed. By using a tailored approach to our interventions, based on the PARE (Prevent, Assist, Recover and Enforce) model, we also encourage more customers to pay and file information on time in the future, through working with customers who have not met their obligations so that they file their outstanding returns, pay their existing debts, and do not get into debt in the future. This contributes to the impact of improving the behaviour of non-compliant customers.

This is achieved by verifying through audit activity that all taxpayer groups are meeting their obligations, specifically targeting risk areas, and taking appropriate enforcement action when obligations are not being met. It also includes managing tax litigation. What is intended to be achieved The purpose of this output expense is to achieve compliance with tax legislation. By targeting non-compliant customers, Inland Revenue will identify additional revenue and help to provide greater certainty to customers about their obligations.

Perhaps the biggest change New Zealanders will see is Inland Revenue’s business transformation. The transformation programme is important for all New Zealanders. It is far more than just updating a computer system. Of all the changes that the programme will usher in, the most significant is a change in the philosophy behind how Inland Revenue conducts its business. There is a much greater focus on customer service, enabled by greater use of information technology. This will see people having far greater control over their own tax affairs; filing tax returns and providing information online, meeting their tax obligations as part of normal business process rather than as a separate activity. It means that our tax administration would be designed around what suits the customer rather than the customer having to fit in with the tax administration. The change in service delivery will allow Inland Revenue to have a growing focus on work of higher value to taxpayers—that is, putting more effort into proactive assistance to help people get it right from the start, rather than relying on later follow-up work. There has been much concern internationally over the question of how much tax large multinational companies pay. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has led a global response to the issue and produced an action plan which details key recommendations that governments around the world can use to strengthen their tax rules. New Zealand, like other countries, is now considering those recommendations and will act on them. This is a major step forward. New Zealand has long had strong tax rules in this area, but the advent of the OECD changes will mean a hugely improved global environment where tax laws of different nations are generally of a higher standard, making it more difficult for tax avoidance and evasion. Another topical issue of international concern is how to collect GST from the growing volume of online sales across borders. Recently, the Government passed a bill which will see intangibles, such as purchases of music provided to New Zealand residents by offshore suppliers, subject to GST from 1 October 2016. New Zealand is not alone in seeking to address the issue, and the proposals align with the OECD guidelines and similar rules that apply in other countries, including the European Union. The changes under the new legislation also align with Australia’s proposed rules. For us, this is a very important first step towards addressing this complex issue. As a big government department, Inland Revenue operating in a more efficient manner without compromising the quality of its services will help produce a better, smarter public service. The first steps are already in place, and when the programme is complete, New Zealand can expect far more integrated, customer-focused service delivery. Meanwhile the policy changes being made will help ensure that our tax system is increasingly fair. I look forward to being part of this evolution of our tax system. Ministerial statement of responsibility I am satisfied that the information on strategic intentions prepared by Inland Revenue is consistent with the policies and performance expectations of the Government. Hon Michael Woodhouse Minister of Revenue 4 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Introduction from the Commissioner and Chief Executive The next five years are among the most important in Inland Revenue’s history as we modernise the entire tax system to fit seamlessly into people’s lives. As Commissioner I am proud to lead Inland Revenue’s customer-centred change and support Better Public Services aims of putting customers at the centre of government services. Transforming the tax system From 2016 onwards we will see massive improvements in how customers work with Inland Revenue. We will make it easier for customers to get their tax and social policy entitlements right from the start, cut compliance costs, and provide the openness and certainty businesses want. We will do this by changing tax processes, policies and administration and implementing new digital technology. Our planning over the last few years has included customer consultation, establishment of strong governance and management, and independent quality assurance. This gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver our complex Business Transformation programme. We now expect to complete our transformation sooner, and with less funding from government, than we initially planned. Customers are already experiencing the benefits of change, such as saving time and effort by filing GST returns through their accounting software. By 2021: • customers will find it simple to manage their tax and entitlements digitally • tax policy and legislation will be simplified • tax and social policy payments will be lined up with people’s lives • new policy changes will be implemented quickly • we will use our information to help customers get it right from the start • improved sharing of intelligence and information across government will improve public services for New Zealanders • compliance costs and effort for businesses will be reduced. From 2017 we will begin transferring services to our new tax and social policy software. This will run alongside our existing system for some time until that system can be safely decommissioned. Transforming Inland Revenue Such massive change has big impacts for our people. The ongoing shift to digital means less need for current manual processes. As we work in new ways with customers, use information proactively and partner further with external agencies, our people will need a variety of different skills. Our structure will change to become more customer-centric and agile and will empower our people to make confident decisions. We will be a smaller organisation by 2021. There are challenges ahead, but our leaders and staff will be well supported throughout change, and we will continue to work closely with unions and staff. Delivering services and collecting revenue It is essential that we maintain New Zealand’s revenue base and deliver consistently great customer service as we transform. We will continue to work closely with other agencies to share information, support customers and deliver Better Public Services across government. We will be able to match services to people’s needs so that social payments line up better with customers’ lives. Digital tools will help more New Zealanders understand their entitlements and connect to services. Our updated compliance approach and strategies for managing debt are starting to change customer behaviours and collect high levels of outstanding revenue, so more money is available to fund government programmes. We will continue to address international tax issues through reforming our own rules and in partnership with the OECD. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 5 Future plans Looking further ahead, we continue to develop insights about the opportunities and pressures that may shape Inland Revenue beyond 2021. Our corporate strategy gives us clear direction and allows us to adapt to future change. The strategy has six strands, which will guide us in planning, making essential shifts and managing risks, while we continue to head towards our goals. These strands cover our customers, our people, our place in a digital world, external collaboration, policy agility, and information and intelligence. I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers and for Inland Revenue. While I do not underestimate future challenges, I am confident our people’s skills and our extensive planning will mean successful delivery of our transformation programme and a simple and certain tax system for New Zealand. Chief Executive’s statement of responsibility In signing this statement, I acknowledge that I am responsible for the information contained in the Statement of Intent for Inland Revenue. This information has been prepared in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989. Naomi Ferguson Chief Executive and Commissioner of Inland Revenue 01 Who we are and what we do STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 7 8 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Our mission and outcomes Our activities Inland Revenue plays a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders. We collect over 80% of the Crown’s revenue. We also collect and distribute social support payments and provide the Government with policy advice. We aim to make it as easy as possible for people to comply with the tax system and to receive their social policy entitlements. We are helping people to get things right from the start, focusing on supporting our customers upfront, before issues arise, rather than just responding to non-compliance when it happens. Our mission is to contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our success is reflected in three outcomes: > Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. > People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. > New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. We have large numbers of customers. For example, in 2014–15: Ta x return Ta x return 1.08 million INDIVIDUALS FILED ANNUAL TAX RETURNS 196,000 EMPLOYERS FILED ABOUT 2.1 MILLION EMPLOYER MONTHLY SCHEDULES 392,000 COMPANIES FILED ANNUAL TAX RETURNS 631,000 REGISTERED GST CUSTOMERS FILED 3 million GST RETURNS ABOUT ABOUT STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 9 01 The scope and scale of our activities 2014–15 We collect revenue, with most coming from personal tax, company tax and GST. $59.7 billion of tax revenue collected We jointly administer student loans with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Development (StudyLink). We collect repayments from student loan borrowers. $1.1 billion student loan repayments collected We administer Working for Families jointly with the Ministry of Social Development. We distribute tax credit entitlements to support working families. $2.4 billion working for families tax credits paid We collect contributions and transfer them to KiwiSaver scheme providers for investment. $4.8 billion KiwiSaver contributions distributed to scheme providers We collect child support payments from liable parents and distribute these payments to carers. $265 million child support payments distributed to carers We make payments, for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, to parents who take leave from their job or business to care for a baby. $180 million paid parental leave payments distributed to parents 10 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 • Change provides professional services to enable the delivery of the tax system 1 for the twenty-first century.

Historically, the New Zealand public-sector operating environment has been relatively uniform and stable, with clear boundaries. However, the last few decades have seen global drivers of change affecting New Zealand in unprecedented ways. We recognise that our world is now characterised by diversity, volatility and permeability, and that new times require new responses. We must continue to maintain the integrity of the tax system as New Zealand’s population becomes more diverse, digitally connected, and mobile. Like all developed countries, New Zealand needs to respond to domestic and international threats to our revenue from tax avoidance and evasion, as well as wider change drivers such as technology-driven change and volatility in the global economy. New Zealand’s population is changing, with increasing numbers of migrants who have different service needs. Our ageing population will also have economic costs and will affect potential revenue. We are working to understand these changes and develop the capabilities, skills and organisational culture required to meet customer needs. We will continue working to: • build our capability to identify and assess emerging trends • challenge our assumptions about the future and apply insights about possible future scenarios to make better decisions today • build agility within Inland Revenue, including speed and ability to shift resources • make better connections between our futures thinking, decision-making, planning, policy design and implementation, and risk-assessment processes • rethink how we collaborate with other government agencies, the private sector, customers and stakeholders. Our organisational structure Inland Revenue is currently structured into nine business groups. We work collaboratively across these business groups, sharing our information with one another and combining our skills and knowledge to maximise our effectiveness. Our operating environment Setting our strategic direction requires us to understand our operating environment and explore how it could change in the future. We are continually evaluating our environment to identify existing and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. This allows us to be ready to respond, ensuring sustainable and successful delivery of our services and the achievement of our vision and mission. 1 – Including the social policy measures that interact with the tax system 02 What we intend to achieve STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 11 12 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Our vision Our strategic objectives We will focus our activity and investment on our three strategic objectives, which are to: • grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right • reduce customer compliance costs • make government policy changes faster and more cost-effectively. Our impacts Our impact statements outline what we intend to achieve with our resources: • customers have easy access to our services • customer effort is reduced over time • customers get it right from the start • we use information and insight to improve potential future revenue • our business is run efficiently and effectively • the policy change process is of high quality, fast and cost-effective • we collaborate with other agencies and the private sector both domestically and internationally to create cost and/or productivity savings • our workforce is highly skilled, motivated and diverse. Our vision is to be a world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. As a world-class revenue organisation we will deliver our outcomes and live our culture and values. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 13 02 We will continue to contribute in many ways to delivering the Government’s priorities, which are to: • responsibly manage the Government’s finances • build a more productive and competitive economy • deliver better public services within tight fiscal constraints • rebuild Canterbury. Our Business Transformation will significantly contribute to the Government’s objectives for a healthy, growing economy and more integrated public services. It will help us to realise savings internally and ensure businesses spend less time on tax and more time on running their business. The Canterbury rebuild remains a priority for Government and a focus for Inland Revenue. As recovery moves to regeneration, we continue to work on improving compliance, ensuring customers get it right from the start. We are providing a range of proactive services to the Canterbury community and monitoring risk areas. Our tax policy work and compliance work help develop a more productive and competitive economy. The Government tax policy work programme covers three broad areas: • Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, including Better Public Services • ‘Base erosion and profit shifting’ and international tax reform • further improvements and enhancements to tax and social policy within the broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) policy framework.

S TA G E 2, Streamline income and business tax, will build on the foundations delivered in the previous stage and further reduce the compliance burden that businesses face. S TA G E 3, Streamline social policy, will improve the delivery of the social policies that Inland Revenue administers. S TA G E 4, Complete delivery, will include transitioning any remaining taxes and social policies to a new platform and decommissioning technology platforms that are no longer required. Our Business Transformation To deliver on our objectives and vision for a modern tax system, we have embarked on a major change programme. Our multi-year, multi-stage Business Transformation programme will re-shape the way the department serves New Zealanders. Simple, certain and open customer-centred services will be designed and delivered in partnership with others inside and outside government. The overall result will be a modern, digital tax system that will serve the needs of all New Zealanders and fit seamlessly into their lives. It will also be a system that keeps pace with change, protecting the Government’s ability to keep providing services. Investment objectives and transformation roadmap In April 2013 the Government agreed our case for change, our four-stage transformation roadmap, and the programme’s investment objectives: • Improve agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Deliver new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Improve productivity and reduce the cost of providing our services. • Improve the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digital provision of services. • Increase the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Minimise the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. Cabinet approved an updated version of the transformation roadmap in November 2015. The new version (summarised in the table below) shows an earlier completion date than originally projected. Delivering our future tax system will require us to: • simplify policy and legislative settings • make more intelligent use of information to ensure customers get it right from the start • fit revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives and enable them to self- manage with speed and certainty • become more agile, effective and efficient • implement a modern technology platform that is digitally based and highly automated. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 19 03 Delivery Delivering a modern tax system is a complex and large-scale task that requires much more than replacing technology. From 2016 to 2021 the programme will deliver on investment objectives by continuing to encourage people to use digital services; partnering with government and business to deliver services that fit seamlessly into our customers’ lives and existing business processes; and making things easier for our customers through better use of information and analytics. We will also be implementing the systems that enable us to deliver these changes. A key part of our work will be providing advice to the Government to make it as simple as possible for New Zealanders to pay what they owe and receive what they are entitled to. The Government’s Making Tax Simpler policy consultation was launched in 2015 and has so far released four discussion documents, covering the future of tax administration, digital services, PAYE and GST administration, and the Tax Administration Act. More policy consultations are planned. In April 2016, the Government made a pre-Budget announcement of 16 new tax initiatives aimed at reducing compliance effort for businesses. The announcement was followed by an officials’ issues paper released by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. We will be engaging customers in proposed changes to the tax system, as customer input will support better-informed decisions. Engagement and communication with customers will also help to ensure that changes are understood and supported, and that the impacts on customers are minimised wherever possible. Stage 1: Enable secure digital services We began Stage 1 of our transformation programme in January 2016. This focuses on implementing GST on our new commercial- off-the-shelf software. The new software, which we are calling START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology), forms the core of the future system and has been specifically designed for tax administration. We have already started working with the software supplier, FAST Enterprises, to configure the system for our needs. START will give us a single view of the customer—accounts, history, connections, feedback and more—in close to real-time. This will help ensure customers get the information and help they need when they need it. The system will also be more agile, enabling us to implement Government policy changes faster and more efficiently. We chose GST to implement first because it is a relatively simple tax that has enough scale to provide us with experience as well as deliver significant customer benefits. The new GST system is planned to go live to customers in mid-2017. As part of Stage 1, we will also be putting in place our supporting technological infrastructure. This includes new data centres, networks, identity and access management, and security management systems. At the same time, we will be making the organisational design changes needed to support Stage 1 and setting up the systems and processes to support organisational change for the duration of the programme. Stage 2: Streamline income and business tax Preparations for Stage 2 of the programme, streamline income and business tax, will begin in 2016, starting with verifying scope and confirming the high-level and detailed design. At the end of Stage 2, in 2019, all tax products will be implemented on START, and the way customers interact with the tax system will have significantly changed. We will have less tax-related processing and fewer customer contacts, and we will provide help and advice to customers based on their needs and circumstances. The amount of time customers spend on meeting their tax obligations will have significantly reduced, as will the cost of providing our services. Making sure we get it right Over the past two years, we have laid the groundwork that will enable successful delivery of our transformation programme. This includes building strong governance systems and bringing together a team of skilled people with experience in delivering complex change programmes. With these elements in place, we have entered the solution delivery phase of Stage 1 well prepared. The people of New Zealand, and their elected representatives, are putting their trust and confidence in us to deliver this significant and extensive programme of change. We will keep providing timely, high-quality information so that people can understand what we are doing, keep track of our progress, and participate. Detailed, up-to-date information can be found on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/transformation/. This site provides key programme documentation, including independent reviews of the programme, and the business cases provided to Cabinet to support their decisions. 20 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Making it easier for customers Helping people to get it right from the start We are making it easier for people to get it right, focusing on supporting our customers upfront, before issues arise, rather than focusing on responding to non-compliance after it happens. Our ‘right from the start’ approach involves putting our customers at the centre of everything we do and developing a greater understanding of their lives, needs, perspectives and behaviours. Providing digital services People expect to receive and provide information online, at any time and from any place. More and more of our customers are going online to access their details, file their returns and make their payments. We will continue to: • improve our website, our online services and our other digital tools to meet customers’ expectations and save them time and money • promote our online services • use online media to inform people about their obligations and entitlements and help them understand what they need to do • encourage people to share their views through online consultations. Enabling digital tax submissions As part of our Business Transformation programme, we have been working with providers of accounting software, looking at allowing customers to file their returns with us directly through that software. Such digital tax submissions will reduce the time that businesses spend double-handling accounts information, reduce errors, and fit tax compliance into businesses’ everyday administration functions. After a successful trial in late 2015, we implemented a new service that allows MYOB and Xero customers to file their GST returns from their accounting software directly to us. Customer feedback indicates that the new process is saving them time and reducing errors. The specifications for enabling online filing have been made available to all accounting software providers. We will roll this functionality out for income tax and PAYE filing as part of our future Business Transformation stages. Our new compliance model supports our shift to more proactive facilitation. Our previous model focused on customers’ attitudes towards compliance. The new model broadens our focus to customers’ motivation, capability and opportunity to comply. CAPABILITY is how well customers can meet their obligations and access their entitlements. It includes their knowledge of rules that apply to them, their access to tools and assistance, and their ability to understand. MOTIVATION is about the factors that create the willingness to comply and then actually follow through and do it. Motivation includes both social and personal norms. OPPORTUNITY is about how easy it is for a customer to comply or not to comply with their obligations or access their entitlements. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 21 03 Protecting New Zealand’s revenue The majority of our customers file and pay on time. However, we recognise that there are many circumstances that can affect people’s abilities to meet their tax obligations. We work with people to understand what is causing their compliance problems and help them get back on track. A small number of people deliberately avoid paying their fair share of tax. The people of New Zealand can have confidence that we take appropriate and effective action in such cases. In the most severe cases, we take legal action. Dealing with debt and unfiled returns We want people to pay and file on time to prevent them getting into debt and being charged penalties and interest. The better we understand our customers’ lives and businesses, the better we can provide support at the right time. To help our customers avoid debt, we contact them by text, email or letter before key dates to remind them they need to file and pay. If customers do get into debt or fail to keep up instalments, we intervene quickly to get them back on track. We are running campaigns to improve the collection of older debt and outstanding returns, following up with case management for people who do not respond to initial contact. We will continue to select cases in which there is a good chance that we will be able to arrange payment and choose the best action to take to achieve that payment. Through this approach, we have been exceeding our cash collection targets, with high rates of return. We sometimes write off debt if collecting it would cost more than the debt itself. Collecting overdue student loan and child support debt The overdue debt of overseas-based student loan borrowers remains high, at over 90% of total overdue student loan debt. Our initiative to target overseas-based borrowers who are not paying what they owe has consistently achieved above-target returns on investment. We focus on encouraging overseas-based borrowers to get in touch with us and pay their student loans, and we remind people about payment dates. We will be accelerating our good progress on resolving child support debt. We contact customers who have got into debt as early as possible, so that we can get them back on track before non-payment becomes entrenched. About two-thirds of overseas-based parents who are not making their child support payments live in Australia. The Australian Department of Human Services continues to successfully get payments from these people on our behalf, and we are also starting to take legal recovery action directly from New Zealand. Ensuring compliance and dealing with non-compliance We are constantly reviewing compliance risk areas, looking for opportunities to reduce non-compliance and to apply international best practice. People and businesses that operate outside the tax and social policy systems undermine the integrity of those systems. Our activities to address areas of non-compliance range from investigating customers’ tax affairs through to providing certainty on the tax implications of specific transactions before a customer takes a tax position. Our debt strategy sets out our long-term goals for debt: • minimise what becomes debt • maximise what is collected • deal appropriately with what cannot be collected. $ 22 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 We expect to continue achieving good results from this investigations and advice work. Specific areas of focus include ‘hidden economy’ activity in a range of at-risk industries, non-compliance in the property sector, tax avoidance arrangements, and ensuring the correct interpretation of tax law in complex tax issues. We continue to strengthen the integrity of the tax system through successful litigation, reducing the number of non-compliers and giving people more certainty about the application of the law. Addressing international tax issues We need to ensure New Zealand is an attractive place in which to do business and invest, and we also need to strengthen tax rules to ensure overseas companies pay their share of tax in New Zealand. The increasing complexity of global business requires us to be actively involved in international solutions to protect revenue. We are participating in the response led by the OECD to the problem of ‘base erosion and profit shifting’ (BEPS). This is a global issue involving multinational organisations taking advantage of the interaction between the tax rules of different countries to pay little or no tax, so the response needs to be global too. We are also spending more time discussing tax matters with large corporates, many of which are international, so that we are able to resolve complex issues quickly and cooperatively. This is reflected in the increase in advance pricing agreements, which are ahead-of-time agreements with our customers on the prices set for the transfer of goods, services and intangibles between associated parties. We will continue to look for such opportunities. Our tax policy work programme includes: • reforming rules for the taxation of cross-border flows of income from investment • international cooperation, including engaging with international tax agencies and developing countries and continuing to work with the OECD and the G20 forum of countries on implementing the BEPS Action Plan, including an automatic exchange of financial account information to counter tax evasion. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 23 03 Collaborating One of our outcomes is that New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. The external collaboration strand of our corporate strategy will guide us in working with others inside and outside of government. Contributing to Better Public Services To achieve the Government’s Better Public Services results, the public sector continues to find better ways of working together. We know that a connected, collaborative public sector can better serve New Zealanders’ needs. Our Business Transformation programme is our best vehicle to deliver on the outcomes sought through Better Public Services, as it will significantly reduce effort for New Zealanders and businesses, making it much easier to deal with government. We will continue to: • identify opportunities to modernise the legislation we administer to support the sharing of information across government (Results 1, 7, 9 and 10) • contribute to the Gang Intelligence Centre (Result 7) • find ways to make it easier and simpler for businesses to interact with us and meet their tax obligations (Result 9) • collaborate with other agencies, primarily the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Accident Compensation Corporation, on implementation of the New Zealand Business Number (Result 9) • work across agencies to design services around people’s life events, such as the birth of a child (Result 10). Sharing information Information is increasingly recognised as an asset. Sharing information across government agencies supports collective outcomes for New Zealand and helps agencies to deliver services with improved quality, speed and accuracy. Collaboration will mean that customers only need to provide government with their information once, and government is better able to achieve cross-agency outcomes. We will gather and share the right information, at the right time, and in the right way. Our challenge is to balance the benefits of sharing against the need to protect customer privacy, commercial interests, and the integrity of the tax system. Our dedicated information-sharing hub, established in 2015, will ensure the effectiveness of our processes for managing secure and reliable information sharing. Through sharing information, we are contributing to Better Public Services Result 1: Reduce the number of people who have been on a working age benefit for more than 12 months. We are a partner agency in delivering: Result 7: Reduce the rates of total crime, violent crime, and youth crime Result 9: Business gains value from easy and seamless dealings with government Result 10: New Zealanders can complete their transactions with government easily in a digital environment. 24 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Sharing sites and services When government departments take a coordinated approach to investment and shared infrastructure, we can find new ways of collaborating and achieve economies of scale. We will continue to engage in procurement activity across government, taking up appropriate all-of-government contracts. We will also continue to participate in cross- agency procurement advisory groups. The Business Transformation programme will adopt suitable common capabilities where these are available, support the delivery of our business outcomes and are cost-effective. The new all-of-government banking services solution provides opportunities for innovation. We will be working with our selected banking providers and with other government agencies to develop innovative customer-focused solutions that will be implemented as part of our Business Transformation programme. Government ICT Strategy The Government ICT Strategy, which was reviewed in 2015, provides new opportunities to support Better Public Services and agency transformation agendas by putting people and businesses at the centre of design and delivery of digital services. The strategy has five key focus areas: Digital Service, Information, Technology, Investment and Leadership. These focus areas are managed through the ICT Partnership Framework, with Inland Revenue being a member of the four working groups as well as the strategic leadership group. In line with the Government’s ICT Strategy, we will use common capabilities and shared services where they are available and fit for purpose. We are currently implementing ‘infrastructure as a service’ and ‘telecommunications as a service’ solutions as part of Stage 1 of our Business Transformation programme. We will be simplifying the management and control of agency data connections to enable more effective information sharing between government agencies and with third parties. We currently share nine sites with other government agencies, which enables collaboration and sharing of assets and service contracts. We will keep taking advantage of site-sharing opportunities as they arise. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 25 03 Our values and culture Our values describe the kind of organisation we aim to be and what is important to us in how we work. They guide how we interact with each other, with our customers, and with our stakeholders and partners. Our values are: • trust and integrity • valuing people • innovating to make a difference • working together. Our three cultural anchors shape our behaviours and ways of work: • Customer-centric: Together we understand the many influences on each customer, and decide how we will work with them to get the best outcomes for New Zealand. • Intelligence-led: We are confident we make good decisions based on quality information and analysis. We continually test and learn to know what the best approaches will be. • Agile: We work at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly, focusing on the things that matter most. Our changing organisation Inland Revenue in the future will be a more efficient organisation. Our workforce will be more knowledge-based and have greater analytical capability. We also expect that by the end of 2021, we will be 25–30% smaller. Over the coming years almost all of our people will feel the impacts of our Business Transformation, and we are working to ensure our people are supported through change. We have set up a transition hub to coordinate change management, supporting people to adjust, re-skill, up-skill or find new opportunities outside Inland Revenue. We are also continuing to work with unions throughout this time of change. The people strand of our corporate strategy (see page 16) will guide us and help us ensure that working as part of Inland Revenue is unique, exciting, fulfilling and career enhancing. We need to ensure that our people have the right mix of skills, knowledge, experience and attitudes to support Inland Revenue through our transformation and beyond. Leaders who can implement change while delivering day-to-day results will be critical to the success of transformation. We have identified a number of other key capabilities that we will prioritise. For example, we will need people who can: • design and plan change • effectively use data and information to develop insights for high- quality decision-making • operate comfortably in a digital environment and support customers to do the same. Diversity and equal employment opportunities Inland Revenue is looking for ways to better understand and respond to the diversity of our people, customers and stakeholders. We are developing an organisational approach to managing diversity and inclusion, which includes establishing a diversity and inclusion reference group and champion to provide advice and guidance. We gather information about our diverse customers and their needs directly from those customers, through our research, and with the help of our own diverse workforce. We will be looking for ways to access our people’s knowledge of the communities that they are part of or interact with. This knowledge will help us to design and deliver the right services and products for our customers’ needs and to approach compliance issues in tailored ways. Inland Revenue is committed to ensuring that a diversity of views is represented at every level of the organisation. We include information in our selection training to support managers in their understanding of, and response to, potential personal bias in selection processes. We also have leadership and talent management frameworks supporting the development of our people into and through our different leadership levels. In 2015, 63% of participants in our leadership development programmes were women, and our women’s network also provides support and coaching for the development of our women as current and future leaders. Our gender profile is as follows: • Staff overall: 64% women • People leaders: 56% women • Managers: 46% women. Our people 26 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Becoming more efficient and effective The Government has prioritised building a more competitive and productive economy and delivering better public services within tight fiscal constraints. With these priorities in mind, we are continually looking for ways to become more efficient and effective. Becoming intelligence-led We are improving the way that we use, manage and analyse information and develop intelligence from customer data. This will help us to understand our customers better, make evidence- based management and policy decisions, and use our resources more effectively. This approach will help us to more efficiently and effectively identify compliance and non-compliance, select the best activities to support compliance, and engage with customers before issues arise. Building a culture of continuous improvement In a continuous improvement environment, teams continually identify, test and implement improvement ideas. We are building a culture of continuous improvement to help us maintain and improve our performance for customers, create capacity to implement our transformation, and improve our internal support services. Developing our people capability and culture is our main goal, but our approach also includes key process improvements that will have a significant impact for us and for our customers. Managing our property We are reducing property costs by ensuring that we make the best use of existing space and by seeking flexibility in leases so that we can easily reduce office space to suit our changing needs. We are contributing towards and supporting the Government’s property functional lead—the Government Property Group— to establish best property-management practice for office accommodation across the public sector. Reviewing our procurement and commercial activity We are reviewing our procurement and commercial activity to achieve better governance and oversight and enhance our capabilities. We need to ensure we have the right skills as we move towards working more with third parties. We have begun by engaging people experienced in managing complex, multi-vendor environments to support the commercial arrangements needed for transformation. To make it easier for small businesses to engage with Inland Revenue, we have developed a supplier panel covering a number of the professional services that we are likely to need repeatedly. This panel is open and allows suppliers to register their interest at any time. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 27 03 Our risk management Our Business Transformation work over the coming years will be substantial, requiring a significant financial commitment and specialist resources, and placing constraints on our capacity and capability. As we transform, we need to continue meeting the expectations of our customers, our stakeholders, and the Government. To help us meet these challenges, we have been developing a strategic approach to risk management. We will monitor and report on seven strategic risks so that we can ensure delivery of our strategic objectives and transformational goals. These risks concern: • access to the right systems and people capability and capacity • disruption through the speed of (transformational) change • disruption through the scale of (transformational) change • soundness of fiscal position • decline in trust and confidence • resilience of the delivery network • effectiveness of strategic alliances Our corporate strategy discussed on pages 16–17 will support the mitigation of these strategic risks. Risks will be tracked and reported on to enable our leaders’ risk-based thinking, discussion and decision-making. Our Risk and Assurance Committee, which is made up entirely of external members, will continue to provide independent oversight of our risk management practices. 04 Measuring our performance STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 29 30 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 We have recently updated our Performance Measurement Framework and reviewed our performance measures, in line with the 2013 amendments to the Public Finance Act 1989. This Act requires agencies to assess and describe their performance with a focus on what is most useful and meaningful for external reporting. Our new Performance Measurement Framework shows how we intend to organise and use our resources to deliver services to New Zealanders and contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. It reflects a shift in focus from the activities we do to the outcomes and impacts we want to achieve. It also reflects Inland Revenue’s transformation over the next few years, which will have implications for how we measure and report performance. We are a complex organisation, and the relationships between our resources, activities, outputs and impacts are not always linear. Our framework demonstrates the connection between what we are aiming to achieve, what we are doing to achieve this, and how we are working toward wider outcomes. Our Performance Measurement Framework VISION : A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence WE USE OUR RESOURCES People Systems Assets Funding Partnerships TO DELIVER OUR SERVICES 1.

Public Sector Reputation index (RepZ) scoreThis is Inland Revenue’s score from the annual Colmar Brunton report on public-sector reputation. The Index benchmarks 31 national public-sector organisations against the four pillars of reputation—leadership and success; social responsibility; trust; and fairness—with each entity’s reputation indexed against the others. Protecting the integrity of the tax system Underpinning the Performance Measurement Framework is our commitment to protecting the integrity of the tax system. We have two integrity measures for 2016–17. Output measures To ensure we remain on track to achieve our impact targets, we have a set of output measures to track our operational performance each year. We use performance measures and targets to report on how well we deliver tax and social policy services to our customers. For 2016–17, we have 46 measures grouped into six output classes: • Policy advice • Services to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations • Services to process obligations and entitlements • Management of debt and outstanding returns • Investigations • Services to other agencies. Our output measures and targets are available in the Vote Revenue Estimates of Appropriations document on the Treasury’s website. Reviewing our measures and targets Each year, we review our measures and targets to make sure they continue to reflect the range of services we provide, changes in our operating environment and feedback from stakeholders, including Audit New Zealand. Work will continue through 2016–17 on developing a set of future measures for implementation in 2017–18. 36 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2016–20 Ta r g e tMilestone By 30 April 2017• GST end-to-end processes implemented in the new computer system (START) • Deliver new functionality to allow customers (or their agents) to self-manage their GST obligations • Enable immigrants to digitally register for an IRD number when they apply for a visa • Customers will be able to identify themselves to Inland Revenue using a New Zealand Business Number By 30 June 2017• Customers will be able to use their RealMe logon to access Inland Revenue online services • Complete the detailed design for Stage 2 of the Business Transformation programme Measuring implementation of our Business Transformation programme We will submit Business Transformation updates to Cabinet twice a year—an interim progress update in July and an annual update in December, including updated costs and benefits and any material changes.

The Government is committed to responsible fiscal management and ensuring that New Zealand has a progressive tax system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. But we also need to ensure that the system is delivering for the needs of society as a whole – not just serving the economy. We strive to build a nation that values the well-being of our communities and seeks to increase the living standards of all New Zealanders through productive, sustainable and inclusive growth. The Government’s Tax Working Group will consider what changes could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system and also consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade. The Government has also announced the establishment of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group to provide independent advice to the Government on the social welfare system. Inland Revenue supports this work and will, in time, implement any changes as the government agency responsible for the delivery of several social policy initiatives including; Working for Families, Paid Parental Leave and Child Support. The outcomes of both working groups could have major consequences for the tax system and Inland Revenue. The third big driver of change is Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. This is all about making tax administration and compliance simpler. 2019 will bring the biggest changes to the New Zealand tax system in a generation. It will affect all New Zealanders, making it easier for them to meet their tax obligations, and receive their refunds and Working for Families entitlements. It will also affect all employers; aligning PAYE with their natural business cycles. As we contemplate the future and the need for the tax system to adapt to changing requirements, I have every confidence in the department to meet those challenges. This Statement of Intent sets out Inland Revenue’s plans for helping the Government to meet its economic and social policy goals. I am satisfied that the information on future operating intentions is in accordance with sections 38, 40 and 41 of the Public Finance Act 1989, and is consistent with the policies and performance expectations of the Government. Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue Introduction from the Commissioner and Chief Executive Looking ahead to 2022, managing taxes and social entitlements will be more certain and simple for New Zealanders, as we deliver the final stages of our business transformation. As Commissioner, it is rewarding to see our goal of supporting customers to get it right from the start becoming a reality. Transforming the revenue system Our plans to transform the revenue system are ambitious but well underway. These include simplifying some policy and legislative settings to wrap revenue processes seamlessly around how people live and how businesses operate. We are creating an organisation that works better across both public and private sectors to improve outcomes for customers. Our people and customers will be supported with a modern, integrated technology system and analytics that will deliver highly automated digital services. We will be able to better target services to our customers’ needs, and intervene when they need assistance, by making more intelligent use of information. Accounts will be updated more regularly allowing customers to manage their accounts with greater speed and certainty. Our organisational structure, business processes and policies will become simpler, more streamlined, and centred around our customers. Empowering our people’s decision-making and improving processes are making it quicker for our frontline people to resolve customers’ queries at first contact. We’re becoming more agile in introducing policy changes for the Government. We will be better positioned to contribute to the broader government outcomes for improving the wellbeing of New Zealanders. By sharing information appropriately across government, we will gain more value from, and add value to, the data held by the public sector, and simplify customers’ interactions with government. We’re also working more collaboratively across the public and private sectors to design and deliver the services New Zealanders need. A recent example is Smart Start, an online resource designed around new and expectant parents, provides information and support to help them access the right services for them and their babies. Underpinning all of this is our new tax and social policy system, START (Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology). We delivered the first two major releases of the START system in February 2017 and April 2018. This is already improving how people and businesses are able to manage their taxes. The first release gave customers the ability to manage GST through our online service, myIR, or their accounting software. By the end of June 2018, 86% of GST returns were filed electronically. This process gave our customers the ability to file and pay GST at the same time, set up instalment arrangements or amend a return, all online. The second release moved over a number of tax types and introduced the new Accounting Income Method option for small businesses to pay provisional tax as they earn, through myIR or their accounting software. Employers can also now provide their PAYE information to us electronically through their software or myIR every payday if they choose to. 4 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 5 Transforming Inland Revenue We took the first steps toward setting up our future organisation in February 2018. We set up two new Customer and Compliance Services groups that will work together to serve our different customer groups. We also set up the new Information and Intelligence Services group, that will support Inland Revenue to serve our customers more effectively by providing data and insights capabilities and tools. We are planning further organisational change between 2019 and 2020 that will build on these changes. By 2021 we will be a smaller and more efficient organisation, as outlined in the business case for our transformation. This is the combined result of our broader capability based roles, new ways of working, automated and streamlined processes, and digital services. Supporting our structural, capability and culture changes is a programme of work to encourage diversity across all levels of Inland Revenue. Encouraging a diverse and inclusive culture will help us to better understand and respond to our customers’ changing needs, and help them meet their obligations. We also want our people to be a reflection of the communities they serve. Delivering services and collecting revenue It is essential that we continue to protect New Zealand’s revenue base and deliver quality customer service as we transform. We are making tax and social entitlements simpler and easier to help our customers meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. By doing this we are playing a critical role in improving the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealanders, which is at the heart of our work. Our work also contributes to the Government’s commitment to improve the wellbeing and living standards of all New Zealanders by building a strong economy. I am excited about the opportunities ahead for our customers and for Inland Revenue. This is a challenging time as we balance providing day-to-day services and maintaining high standards of performance with delivering the final stages of our transformation. We need to use and manage across both the old and new systems during this time. I am confident our people’s skills and customer centric approach and our extensive planning will mean we successfully deliver our transformation programme, and a simple and certain revenue system for New Zealand. Chief Executive’s statement of responsibility In signing this statement, I acknowledge that I am responsible for the information contained in the Statement of Intent for Inland Revenue. This information has been prepared in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner and Chief Executive 6 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 Our mission We collect over 80% of the Government’s revenue. In the 2017–18 financial year, we collected $73.0 billion in revenue to help fund government services for the people of New Zealand. We also administer a number of social policy programmes. We manage student loan and child support obligations, pay out Working for Families tax credits, parental leave and Best Start payments, and administer KiwiSaver. We are the principal steward of New Zealand’s revenue system. We have a crucial role to play in maintaining and enhancing the integrity of the tax system by making sure the system is clear, consistent and simple. We provide advice to the Government on tax policy and the social policies that we administer. We also advise the Government on international tax issues and are involved in the development and implementation of New Zealand’s international tax legislation. The needs and wellbeing of New Zealanders are at the heart of the work we do. Inland Revenue works with others inside and outside government to deliver services that meet customers’ needs and expectations. We need to make sure we are protecting the integrity of the tax system at all times. This includes our customers’: • trust in us • rights to confidentiality • rights to have their tax determined fairly, impartially and according to the law • responsibilities to comply with the law. We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. Our outcomes are: > Revenue is available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. > People receive payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. > New Zealanders benefit economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. What we are here for STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 7 Our customers We have a wide range of customers, including employees, employers, the self-employed, companies, not-for-profit organisations, trusts, Māori authorities, tax agents, parents, students, savers and investors. As well as all people earning money in New Zealand, our customers include people who live overseas but have tax affairs or social policy obligations here. Statistical information about our customers is available at www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/external-stats/customers/. This shows, for example, numbers of our customers by customer group, entity type and geographic area. We want to make it easy for our customers to interact with us and to pay and receive the right amount, whatever their circumstances. Tax affects everyone, and social policy programmes affect most New Zealanders too. We are committed to making this as seamless and easy as possible. As the make-up of New Zealand changes, we must change to make sure we can keep meeting our customers’ expectations.

They are to: • Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right. • Reduce customer compliance costs. • Make government policy changes faster and more cost- effectively. Our impacts show the difference we want to make, so our customers are able to get it right from the start: • Our customers know what to do. • Our customers find it easy. • Our customers do what they need to. • We use intelligence and insight to improve compliance and customer outcomes. • We deliver evidence-based policy that is innovative and responsive to customer needs. • We work with others to create better results for customers and government. A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. We want to achieve our outcomes and keep our customers at the centre of everything we do. We are making tax simpler and easier to help our customers meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. We also collaborate with other agencies across government and other service providers to improve services to New Zealanders. Contributing to government priorities The Government has 12 priority outcomes grouped into three broad themes: Building a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy • grow and share New Zealand’s prosperity • deliver responsible governance with a broader measure of success • support thriving and sustainable regions • transition to a clean, green and carbon neutral New Zealand Improving the wellbeing of New Zealanders and their families • ensure everyone is earning, learning, caring or volunteering • support healthier, safer, and more connected communities • ensure everyone has a warm, dry home • make New Zealand the best place in the world for children Providing new leadership by government • deliver transparent and compassionate government • build closer partnerships with Māori • value who we are as a country • create an international reputation we can be proud of We contribute to these priorities through collecting and distributing money, making our services more accessible and easy to use, and working with other agencies to build quality public services, share information and realise better outcomes for New Zealanders. What we want to achieve STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 9 We are committed to ensuring that a diversity of views is represented at every level of the organisation. Our approach to strengthening diversity and inclusion includes a Diversity and Inclusion Champion who provides leadership for our diversity and inclusion work plan, and Te Manu Korihi—an advisory group made up of external and internal members who provide diverse perspectives on a range of issues. Overall, our workforce currently reflects the ethnic composition of New Zealand with our people representing 114 different ethnicities. Our ethnicity profile, based on Statistics New Zealand Standard Reporting, is: Addressing the gender pay gap The overall gender pay gap at Inland Revenue is currently 19.4%. This means that when all salaries are averaged, women earn approximately 80 cents for every $1 earned by male staff. A significant contribution to this gap is the under- representation of women in senior leadership and more complex roles. Although women make up the majority of staff across Inland Revenue, and there are more women than men on our executive leadership team, men make up the majority of staff on salaries above $100,000. We generally appoint new staff at similar positions on their salary band, irrespective of their gender. However, for people leaders, our data shows we appoint women at lower points on the salary band than men. This results in a gender pay gap for people leaders that continues over time, despite women generally performing better in their first year as we have seen in the past through performance ratings. Our focus is to understand the drivers of the gender pay issue and develop specific actions to reduce the overall gender pay gap. Strengthening diversity and inclusion Meeting the diverse needs of New Zealand’s people is important to us. Having a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture enables us to better understand and respond to our customers’ needs. As we become a more customer-centric and intelligence-led organisation, our diverse workforce will help us design and deliver the right services for our customers and support compliance in tailored ways.

We evaluate our environment to identify existing and emerging trends, risks and opportunities. This allows us to be responsive and build resilience, ensuring sustainable and successful delivery of our services and the achievement of our mission, vision and outcomes. Our changing operating environment As part of our work to understand our operating environment, we seek information and insight from others and share our own with them. Through this work, we connect across both the public and private sectors, both nationally and internationally. This includes working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Australian Taxation Office, and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom. Our strategic futures programme, Te Kāhu Mataroa 1 , allows us to better understand our future operating environment. We structure our thinking around eight global drivers of change that allow us to consider the effect of change on New Zealand’s economy and society, and therefore the possible impacts on Inland Revenue’s products, services and ways of operating. We can determine how we need to respond, including what changes we need to make to our strategic direction. • Empowered individuals—people connecting directly with each other instead of through institutions. • Disruptive technology—advances in technology that are changing business models, how whole sectors operate, and the type of company that is dominating certain sectors. • Maturing digital ecosystem—the cloud, social networks, mobile, big data. • Population growth—global population growth, and increasing competition for food, water, energy, and land. • Demographic transition—ageing populations in many countries and the affordability challenge this poses; ethnicity and cultural changes in society. • Power shift—global economic power shift from west to east. • Climate change—disruptions through drought and flood, and increases in pests and diseases. • Urbanisation—cities driving economic growth and how urban centres are evolving. Our research and analysis indicates these drivers of change have remained the most relevant for Inland Revenue over several years. We check the relevance of drivers on a regular basis. Recent research also shows other aspects of the environment are beginning to challenge us. Rapid technological change, globalisation and social inequity are leading to declining trust in government and institutions in many countries. In some countries there is an increase in restricting international trade to protect local businesses and jobs. There is a rise of organisations, including multinational companies, that influence society and political decisions but are independent of government. We will continue to look at research about the changing nature of government to assess whether it needs to join our drivers of change. The operating environment is evolving quickly, but we are well placed to manage change. We will continue to consider the potential impacts of the drivers of change on New Zealand. This work includes regular environmental scanning that feeds into our planning, risk, policy and strategy development processes. The eight drivers of global change 1 Te Kāhu Mataroa – Kāhu is a harrier hawk that spends time aloft with its keen eyes looking to pick up what’s important, heading to earth when it sees something it wants. The Mataroa part is about focusing on and giving great consideration to something. In this case it’s giving that focus to what we see on the horizon. This relates to the environment we are scanning. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 11 Te Kāhu Mataroa Te Kāhu Mataroa is our strategic futures programme. We are exploring a number of topics arising from the connections between the eight global drivers of change, looking at their implications for Inland Revenue and the tax and social policy system. These topics include: • Demographic change In the coming decades there are likely to be greater calls on health care and superannuation, but with a proportionally smaller workforce paying income tax. This presents an affordability challenge for the government. • Disruptive technology, including distributed ledger technology This is the technology that underlies Bitcoin. It enables databases without a central repository—instead each participant holds a copy of the database. This is anticipated to be the biggest short-to-medium term disruption to financial systems and financial service business models worldwide. • The nature of work The existence of jobs and business as we know it is changing. This includes greater automation, artificial intelligence, more people exchanging goods and services directly, and more people working in short-term positions for multiple employers. • The public sector How the public sector delivers services needs to keep pace with changes in society. Customers’ expectations have implications for technology, information sharing, and how the sector works with other parts of society. • Trust in government institutions This is vital for motivating people to pay their taxes and for the successful implementation of policy. This trust has been eroding in many countries. The situation is not yet clear in New Zealand, but longer term it may mean Inland Revenue cannot rely on operating in an environment of high trust. There are already differing levels of trust in Inland Revenue and the wider public sector between different ethnic, socio-economic, and demographic groups. From these topics, and others that may arise, such as the rapid growth and power of digital multinational organisations, we will strive for continuous improvement to keep the tax and social policy framework and wider system sustainable and relevant. As we anticipate and prepare for a new operating environment we will adjust our strategy when needed. 12 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 We believe we are most likely to achieve our objectives by keeping our customers at the centre of everything we do. Our strategy provides direction and focus, to help us achieve better outcomes for our customers and government. We also have specific segment strategies for our different types of customers to help us to design our services around our customers and their needs. Our strategy Our strategy is our long-term approach to creating value and better outcomes for New Zealanders. It provides us with direction and keeps us focused throughout our transformation and beyond. Our strategy was developed in the context of our transformation and looks beyond the transformation programme itself. Our strategy has six interconnected strands, which are described on the following pages. The intent and delivery plan for each strand will continue to develop over time as our operating environment changes and as we transform. How we will achieve our objectives We are creating a modern, digital revenue system that will meet the needs of all New Zealanders. As part of this transformation, we are making tax simpler and easier, to help our customers meet their obligations and to make sure they receive the payments they are entitled to. We are also changing our organisational structure and the way we work. As we change our organisational structure, systems and processes, it is essential that we continue to be a trusted, effective and efficient government agency. We will continue to ensure our organisation and governance structure is efficient and effective. We are managing any risks to our business so that we can achieve our strategic and operational objectives. Our plans over the next four years are ambitious. We need to progress our transformation as quickly as possible to minimise the risk associated with operating two systems at the same time. This means we have limited capacity to implement additional changes beyond the plans set out in this document. Adding to this context are the reviews of the tax and social welfare systems that are currently underway. These are being led by the Tax Working Group and Welfare Expert Advisory Group. Recommendations from these might lead to changes to the Government’s tax policy work programme. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 13 • We anticipate and proactively support key events in our customers’ lives at the right time. • We use customer insights to inform activities. • Our services are seamless, and tax and social policy are integrated into customers’ lives. • We partner with others to deliver service excellence to customers—from policy design, to education, to audit. • We make it easy for customers to get it right and we reduce compliance costs and effort. We are becoming a customer-centric organisation—fitting our processes more seamlessly into customers’ lives, rather than expecting them to fit their lives around our processes. We are developing greater understanding of our customers so that we and our partner organisations can provide the right support at the right time. To help us put our customers at the centre of everything we do and to design our services around our customers, we have identified five customer segments; families, individuals, micro business, small and medium enterprises, and significant enterprises. Being customer- centric will mean we can improve customers’ experiences and decrease their costs when dealing with tax and social policy. There are three broad ways we are bringing this about: 1. Organising ourselves around our customers and outcomes rather than products and outputs. Our culture, capabilities, and processes will help our people to bring a greater understanding of our customers into the design and delivery of services. 2. Building our understanding of our customers and using customer insights to continuously inform and improve our activities. This includes using continuous learning loops to improve as we go. 3. Designing customer experiences that reduce customers’ compliance cost and effort and increase their trust in us. We want to provide personalised, timely and seamless services that are integrated across government and other business partners. Customer: Putting the customer at the centre of everything we do External collaboration: We work with external parties to innovate, gain insight, and achieve wider government economic and social outcomes • We will build capability, which supports external collaboration. • We co-create services, adapting our business model where appropriate. • We use our information and expertise to create mutual benefits. • We share information and resources using appropriate safeguards. New Zealanders will benefit socially and economically through Inland Revenue working collaboratively and being part of the broader public service. Our information and expertise are strategic assets that we will share to benefit government and society. Our customers cross boundaries and borders in an ever- changing environment. To provide better support and deliver a seamless experience for customers of government agencies, we need to work across those boundaries and borders too. There are three broad ways we are bringing this about: 1. Understanding our external environment and positioning ourselves accordingly. We take a holistic view across our external environment so that we can adapt to changes and innovate. 2. Extending our boundaries. We participate in the wider system, working with other government agencies and with private-sector and not-for- profit parties when it makes sense. We collaborate with others to make dealing with government easy. 3. Adapting the way we work. We use our improved commercial understanding to change the way we operate, and use superior relationship management skills to engage and deliver results with our stakeholders. We reduce or remove barriers that stop us using information and expertise to deliver value. 14 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 Information and intelligence: Our decisions and actions—for delivering today and shaping our future—are intelligence-led • We understand information we collect and the insight and intelligence we generate through the knowledge and experiences of our people is a strategic asset that needs to be managed and shared appropriately. • We use information and insights to create actionable intelligence. • Intelligence drives our strategic and tactical decision making, including knowing where and when to direct resources to realise value for customers, Inland Revenue, the public service, and the Government. As we become increasingly intelligence-led over the next four years, the quality, timeliness and accuracy of the information we collect will improve, and we will identify more opportunities to share information. This will help us to target resources to the areas that provide the best value to customers and government. Using customer insights will help us to continually improve our activities, to maintain and enhance the integrity of the tax system by better targeting our interventions, and to design and deliver the right customer experience. We will: 1. Implement better information management practices, and appropriately share information across Inland Revenue, across government and with business partners. 2. Develop our capability to use information and insights to create intelligence, including lifting our advanced analytics capability. 3. Build our culture of intelligence-led decision making and consistently measure and evaluate activity to focus on what works. Digital: We fully embrace our place in the digitally connected world • As part of the digital world, we make it easy to collaborate with customers, agencies and others. • Our culture and flexible systems mean we design and make changes quickly. • Our customers can easily access secure digital services anywhere, any time. • We use the digital environment to help generate actionable insights. • We encourage, empower and upskill our people to make best use of digital ways of working. • We strategically manage digital opportunities and risks from disruptions. We are transforming so that we can deliver a modern, digital revenue system that will better serve our customers’ needs. In the future, we expect most people will interact with us through simple and secure digital services, and most tax transactions will be managed through accounting software used by businesses, employers, tax agents and intermediaries. Our digital systems, channels and services do not stand alone—they are part of the wider digital ‘ecosystem’. Being part of the digital world gives us unprecedented opportunities to better meet the expectations of our customers and our own people, to connect more easily with others, and to share useful information quickly. As well as being prepared to take advantage of digital opportunities as they arise, we need to be prepared for disruptions. We will continue to refresh our approach to keep pace with the rapidly changing digital world. The key ways we are implementing our digital vision are: 1. Using flexible and collaborative information and communications technology services and platforms to provide better digital services and lift our advanced analytics capability. 2. Establishing a Digital Centre of Excellence to help us identify areas of best value from our digital capability and manage that capability effectively. 3. Working with our customers, our people, our business partners and other agencies to continually develop our approaches and respond to innovative ideas. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 15 Policy agility: Policy change is faster, cheaper and better—fit for a changing world People: Working as part of Inland Revenue is unique, exciting, fulfilling and career-enhancing • Our policy design is proactive, coherent and integrated, from idea generation and advice, through to implementation. • We implement policy decisions speedily and smoothly. • We deliver high quality advice that is future focused, realistic about the impacts and based on good information and analysis. • We are a trusted and credible voice that shapes and delivers government and system outcomes. • We use innovative, flexible and creative practices to design policy, supported by strong economic frameworks and broad consultation. Policy agility applies across our end-to-end policy process, from idea generation and innovation, through policy development, to implementation and evaluation. We will develop new ways of working, with everyone involved working more effectively together. Policy advice will be supported by better information and analytics and will be more joined up across government. We need greater policy agility so that we can maintain our world-class revenue system in an increasingly complex and changing world. We will retain and grow the capabilities our people need to become policy professionals of the future and improve our tool-sets so that our policy advice is high quality, timely and evidence-based. Improving our policy agility helps us meet our regulatory stewardship responsibilities, ensuring we are taking a proactive, collaborative approach to the monitoring and care of the legislation that we administer. We are lifting our policy agility through three areas of work: 1. Making changes now so that we are best placed to delivery policy agility in the future. 2. Better implementation of policy, largely being delivered through our new technology platform, new organisation structure and ways of working. 3. Lifting information and analytical capability to enable enhanced modelling of impacts (including economic, revenue, compliance, behavioural and administrative impacts) and better evaluation of policy. • We value individuals and diversity of thought and capability. • We find, develop and deploy people on the basis of their capabilities, which are a mix of skills, knowledge, experience and attitudes. • We design roles to be adaptable, interesting and empowering. • We recognise and measure performance through behaviours and individual and team contribution to outcomes. • We work with other organisations to develop fulfilling career journeys in, through and beyond Inland Revenue. To achieve the strategic vision for our people, we are focusing on four connected elements: • Ethos—our values, spirit and mind-set. • Experience—the practice and reality of working as part of Inland Revenue. • Environment—the settings and surroundings within which our work is done. • Expectations—the performance assumptions that define the working relationships between Inland Revenue and our people. These will be delivered in line with three guiding principles: 1. Individuality matters. We will listen to the perspective of what works for each member of our workforce the same way we do with each of our customers. 2. Empowerment guides our practice. As an organisation we will work to provide a range of options for our people, enabling them to make decisions about how best they can deliver and perform. 3. Agility keeps us relevant. We will design and manage our work as flexibly as we can, with simple approaches and processes that can adapt as we need them to. 16 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 Completing our transformation programme Customers will spend less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements, as tax will be correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. The Government will have greater ability to make policy changes faster and more effectively and will be better able to use the information we hold to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealanders. Transformation is more than an upgrade of technology. It includes changes to policy, process, technology and Inland Revenue’s organisational design. It involves: • simplifying policy and legislative settings • making more intelligent use of information to proactively ensure customers get it right from the start • fitting revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives • creating an organisation that works together better to improve outcomes for customers • implementing a modern technology system that is digitally based and highly automated. New Zealand’s revenue system is being transformed in overlapping stages: Inland Revenue is transforming. We are creating a modern, digital, revenue system that is: • based around customers’ needs • easy to understand and interact with • digital and highly automated, with software doing most of the work • more responsive, flexible and certain for customers • more flexible to implement policy change for government • linked to services delivered by others inside and outside government. Within these stages, taxes and entitlements will be moved to the new system in a series of releases. Major releases are planned to align with the beginning of the tax year in each of the next three years. The first release, GST, was in February 2017. In April 2018, release 2 involved withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, payroll subsidy and gaming machine duty being moved to the new system. This release enhances customer experiences, reduces the effort required by businesses to meet their obligations and improves customer compliance through: • employers being able to provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue every payday if they choose to • an enhanced myIR service, enabling employers to correct payroll errors themselves once they have adopted payday reporting • the introduction of the accounting income method option for calculating provisional tax • the implementation of the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) with international tax treaty partners. Stage 1 Enable secure digital services Stage 2 Streamline tax Stage 3 Streamline social policy Stage 4 Complete the future revenue system 2016–17 Major Release 1Major Release 2Major Release 3Major Release 4Major Release 5 2018–192017–182019–202020–21 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 17 Based on the current release plan, remaining taxes and Working for Families, including BestStart, will be implemented in the new system in April 2019. KiwiSaver and student loans are scheduled for April 2020, and child support for April 2021. We plan to move taxes into the new system before we move our social policy products to ensure that the income information the entitlements rely on is accurate. The implementation of release 3 in April 2019 is a key milestone, when all customer records will be in our new system. For this implementation, we will learn as we go and refine our rollout plan accordingly. Following release 3, we will be in a stronger position to implement any recommendations adopted by Cabinet from either the Tax Working Group or the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. Changing the way we work We are making changes to our systems and processes and we are changing the way we work. We are becoming increasingly: • Customer-centric: We understand the many influences on each customer, and decide how we will work with them to get the best outcomes for New Zealand. • Intelligence-led: We are confident we make good decisions based on quality information and analysis. We continually test and learn to know what the best approaches will be. • Agile: We work at pace, pulling together the right people to make good decisions quickly, focusing on the things that matter most. We are making changes to our leadership and culture, our decision making framework and delegations, our workflows, how we measure ourselves, how we are structured and our roles. Designing and implementing a new organisation We have taken the first steps to create our future organisation. In February 2018, our new Customer and Compliance Services and Information and Intelligence Services groups were established. Further organisational change is expected in the 2019–20 financial year that will build on these changes. Once our business transformation programme is complete, we will be a smaller and more effective and efficient organisation. Our new design enables people to apply their skills more broadly to a range of work, work together more closely, provide better services to customers and make the most of a new and evolving working environment, supported by technology. We have redesigned some of the foundations that support our people to succeed. Our roles are broader and more outcome- focussed, and our performance approach is aligned to the key shifts we want to achieve. We also have a comprehensive programme to help our staff develop their capabilities, a tailored approach to learning and development, and a focus on supporting our leaders to coach and develop their people. We are progressively embedding new ways of working. We will measure our progress throughout the changes to help us take an intelligent, capability-led approach to planning and managing our workforce, and we will monitor the experience of our people so we can be responsive to their needs. Benefits from our transformation The changes being delivered by transformation will: • Enhance our ability to collect tax revenue and distribute entitlements. • Improve the Government’s ability to make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively. • Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right and, using analytics, target our interventions where they are needed. • Create an information asset that can be leveraged by Inland Revenue and, where appropriate, other agencies to deliver improved outcomes for New Zealand. • Deliver cumulative additional Crown revenue of $2,880m–$6,175m by 2023–24. • Deliver cumulative compliance cost savings (economic benefits) for small–medium sized enterprises in particular, until 2023–24 of between $1,330m–$2,265m (a reduction of 18–26 hours spent on compliance each year by 2023–24). • Enable Inland Revenue to realise administrative savings of $495m–$580m by 2023–24. 18 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 Organisation Development Committee Portfolio Governance Committee Customer- centric Committee Strategic Governance Board Performance & Investment Committee Technical Governance Committee Managing our organisation Our organisational structure We organise ourselves into business groups. We work collaboratively across these groups, sharing information with one another and combining our skills and knowledge to improve outcomes for our customers, government and ourselves. Our current business groups are: Corporate Integrity and Assurance provides independent advice, support and assurance, making sure we are doing the right things in the right way. Customer and Compliance Services—Business assists customers to work through complex tax arrangements and compliance issues. Uses analytics, forensics and case management to target end- to-end services. Fosters relationships with delivery partners to support service delivery. Customer and Compliance Services—Individuals assists customers to seamlessly comply and access entitlements right from the start through delivering targeted and efficient services and communications.

Information and Intelligence Services helps us keep customers’ needs in mind, and use data and intelligence to help us understand and influence customer behaviour. Information Technology and Change develops, delivers, improves and supports our information technology systems. The Office of the Chief Tax Counsel provides technical advice about the interpretation and application of tax law for us and our customers. People and Culture enables us to lift organisational performance through our people. Performance, Facilities and Finance provides facilities for our people, business performance analytics, financial and planning advice, and analysis. Policy and Strategy provides tax and social policy advice to the Government, with the Treasury, and leads the development of our strategy. Transformation ensures transformation is implemented successfully, including delivery of solutions, services and benefit enablers, managing costs within the approved funding, and meeting committed timeframes. Manages robust change processes to ensure stakeholders’ needs are met and supports stakeholders to adopt new systems and processes. Our governance structure Our governance bodies lead and guide our organisation. They set our strategic direction and oversee our progress. The boards and committees that make up our governance system are as follows: • The Strategic Governance Board governs our strategic direction. This includes ensuring all elements of our transformation come together and having oversight on where we may need to speed up or slow down investment in our transformation journey. • The Performance and Investment Committee governs our organisation performance and investment decisions, assuring alignment with our strategic objectives and Government policies. • The Portfolio Governance Committee governs all existing programmes and projects within our single investment portfolio to ensure they are managed well and remain healthy. • The Technical Governance Committee ensures the effective co-ordination and management of our legal and technical business and significant tax technical issues. • The Customer-centric Committee focuses on developing capability relating to customer understanding, including how intelligence can be used to better understand our customers and enhance our decision-making. • The Organisation Development Committee governs the development of our organisation and workforce, ensuring alignment with our strategic direction. Membership is based on having the right expertise across the different governance forums, with a mix of executive leaders, senior leaders and external members where appropriate.

The members have clearly defined roles and responsibilities to ensure separation of governance and management accountabilities. We regularly review our governance structure to ensure it is providing the optimum oversight and support. We also have a Risk and Assurance Committee that provides independent advice to the Commissioner regarding Inland Revenue’s risk management and system of internal controls. Managing our risks Our risk management approach relies on the support and participation of all our staff. Each business group is responsible for identifying, monitoring and mitigating the risks in their business area. We have an Enterprise Risk Management Framework based on international standards for identifying and managing risks. This approach supports risk-based decision-making across all levels of the organisation. We regularly discuss and update our enterprise risks, alongside the triggers that could cause each risk to eventuate, the consequences should that happen, and the controls in place to reduce the risk’s likelihood and consequences. The Strategic Governance Board oversees risk management, and other governance bodies monitor specific areas of risk and performance. The Risk and Assurance Committee provides independent oversight. Our current enterprise risks are: 20 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2018–22 Our Performance Measurement Framework shows how we intend to organise and use our resources to deliver services to New Zealanders and contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. We updated it recently to reflect a shift in focus from the activities we do to the outcomes and impacts we want to achieve. How we will monitor our performance Our outcomes are the long term results we want to achieve to ensure we contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. We measure our progress in achieving each of our three outcomes. Our impacts show the difference we want to make, so our customers get it right from the start. The measures for our three customer impacts indicate our effectiveness in enabling our customers to get it right. The measures for our three supporting impacts track what we are doing to make it easier for our customers. Our services are what we deliver for our customers and stakeholders. Our operational performance is assessed through our output measures. These measures ensure we remain on track to achieve our impacts and outcomes. Our organisational health is about how we use our resources to deliver for our customers and Government, and ensure our performance is sustainable. Our organisational health measures let us know how our people are doing, as well as our systems, assets, investments and finances. Our culture is what is important to us in how we work. We have woven measures of integrity through all layers of our performance measurement framework to reflect our commitment to protecting the integrity of the tax and social policy system. Each year we review our measures and targets to make sure they continue to reflect the range of services we provide and the changes in our operating environment, and that they continue to support the achievement of the outcomes we are seeking. Reporting our performance We report: • our performance to Parliament and the people of New Zealand through our Annual Report. The current and past Annual Reports are available at www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/annual-report/ • on our transformation, including implementation progress and benefits realised.

Hōnore David Parker Minita Whiwhinga Pūtea STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 3 A tax and social policy system that is fair and coherent – and is complied with – is essential to New Zealand’s continued stability and prosperity. It supports the Government’s ability to achieve social, economic, and fiscal priorities. These priorities include further COVID-19 recovery initiatives; work on housing affordability; research and development; responding to climate change; improving tax rules for digital multinationals to give New Zealand businesses a level-playing field; addressing inequality and ensuring everyone pays their fair share. Inland Revenue plays an important role in contributing to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand. My role, as the Minister of Revenue, is to ensure Inland Revenue has the resources and mandate it needs to help people pay and receive the right amounts. That means supporting people to get things right from the start and reducing opportunities for non-compliance. Our tax system relies on the majority of people paying the right amount of tax. People by and large believe that paying taxes is for the greater good. Tax funds important public services they, their families and society benefit from. People are finding it easier to comply due to Inland Revenue’s transformation. Where people do not comply and do not pay their fair share there are clear rules and enforcement powers that can be used. By mid-2022 Inland Revenue will have completed its multi- year, multi-stage transformation programme to modernise the revenue system and make tax simpler, more open and certain for New Zealanders. Government is already seeing some of the benefits of its investment in the programme, such as the rapid and effective way Inland Revenue was able to implement measures to support businesses and individuals impacted by COVID-19. I am confident that by 2023–24 the Government and taxpayers will see the full value of the investment they have made. Tax policy work programme Government’s tax policy work programme for the next 18 months will support the response to COVID-19 and rebuild the economy, enhance productivity and increase the fairness of the tax system. This Statement of Intent sets out Inland Revenue’s plans for helping the Government to meet its economic and social policy goals. I am satisfied that the information on future operating intentions is in accordance with sections 38 and 40 of the Public Finance Act 1989, and is consistent with the policies and performance expectations of the Government.

Naomi Ferguson Kaikōmihana me Te Tumu Whakarae 6 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Introduction from the Commissioner and Chief Executive The needs and wellbeing of New Zealanders are at the heart of the work we do. As the make-up of New Zealand changes, we will continue to evolve to make sure we meet customers’ needs, now and in the future. Our transformed revenue system and organisation Since 2017 Inland Revenue has transformed the way we deliver services by modernising the revenue system and making tax simpler, more open, and certain for our customers. New Zealand now has a modern, digital, revenue system which reduces customer effort and cost, is more resilient, improves compliance levels, and enables policy changes to be made faster and more cost-effectively. This was clearly demonstrated in the way we have been able to support the COVID-19 response. A strong tax and social policy system will continue to support the recovery from COVID-19. We will contribute to Government’s priorities, including economic recovery and social wellbeing, by collecting and distributing money and making it easier for New Zealanders to receive the support they need. We are motivated by the knowledge that what we do is vital for the wellbeing of New Zealanders. As part of our new operating model, we have also invested in our people so they are able and comfortable working digitally. We will continue to support the development of our people’s digital capability to support our new processes and ways of working. With compliance at the heart of our work, our focus will continue to be on helping customers to get things right. This includes designing services around our different customer groups to meet their needs, as well as building in compliance checks right from the start. Our new digital and analytical capabilities enable us to work in increasingly targeted and effective ways to support compliance and maintain integrity and trust in the revenue system. Naomi Ferguson Commissioner and Chief Executive STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 7 Building an effective Māori Crown relationship We are committed to meeting our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency. Becoming a better partner in the Māori Crown relationship is being driven through our Māhutonga programme. This seeks to integrate Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts, and practices into the way we work. A key component of this is delivering on Te Arawhiti’s Whāinga Amorangi expectations to transform Public Service leadership capability in Māori Crown relations. We will also build our people’s Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo Māori and tikanga Māori capability by developing an organisation-wide training programme, Te Arapiki. Looking ahead Working with our partners across government delivers better outcomes for New Zealanders and we will continue to collaborate to improve services. We will look to work with our partners to maximise the benefits of transformation, such as sharing our expertise. By mid-2022 we will have delivered our transformation programme, and the final release will set us up to ensure benefits are fully realised for our customers and the Crown. We are already seeing significant delivery of benefits and outcomes. We will continue to modernise the revenue system and look for further opportunities to leverage the significant investment made in our capabilities. This will support us in guiding our future direction, to deliver a world-class system for the benefit of all New Zealanders. Chief Executive’s statement of responsibility In signing this statement, I acknowledge that I am responsible for the information contained in the Statement of Intent for Inland Revenue. This information has been prepared in accordance with the Public Finance Act 1989.

We administer the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the resurgence support payment introduced in response to COVID-19. We contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand by collecting and distributing money. We serve the people of New Zealand by focusing on: > Revenue being available to fund government programmes through people meeting payment obligations of their own accord. > People receiving payments they are entitled to, enabling them to participate in society. > New Zealanders benefitting economically and socially through Inland Revenue working collaboratively across our external environment. What we are here for He aha tā mātou mahi Our mission 80% WE COLLECT OVER of the Crown’s revenue STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 9 We act impartially and independently. The Commissioner has statutory independence and is responsible for our performance and making decisions about what our resources work on. We are the principal steward of New Zealand’s revenue system. This means we make sure that each product we are responsible for and the revenue system as a whole: >is effective and efficient >works as intended >achieves the intended outcomes >is fit for purpose. We maintain the integrity of the revenue system by making it clear and simple for people to pay and receive the right amounts. We develop policy and design processes to meet customers’ and stakeholders’ needs as they change and evolve, and evaluate how effective they are. We advise the Government on tax policy and the social policies we administer, together with other agencies where appropriate. This includes advising the Government on international tax issues and developing New Zealand’s international tax legislation. We have responsibility for, or a major role in: >Collecting revenue (most of the revenue we collect comes from income tax and GST). >Administering Working for Families, child support, KiwiSaver, student loans, paid parental leave, and unclaimed money. >Sharing information with other agencies. >Administering COVID-19 response packages – including the small business cashflow (loan) scheme and the resurgence support payment. We also support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to administer the wage subsidy scheme. Together with other government agencies we have a role to play in delivering inter-generational wellbeing and positive outcomes over time for all New Zealanders. This includes meeting our obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi and delivering on our role as part of the Māori Crown relationship. Our role 10 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 INDIVIDUALS 3.1 million customers received an automatic individual income tax assessment EMPLOYERS Approximately 222,000 employers filed more than 7.4 million employment information returns. COMPANIES Over 366,000 company tax returns were filed. GST FILERS Approximately 660,000 customers filed more than 3 million goods and services tax (GST) returns. In the tax year ended March 2020:\* In the 2020–21 financial year, we collaborated with our partners to administer: Tax affects everyone and social policy programmes affect most New Zealanders too. That’s why the needs and wellbeing of all New Zealanders are at the heart of the work we do. As well as all people earning income in New Zealand, our customers include people who live overseas but have tax affairs and/or social policy obligations here. We work with our partners and colleagues inside and outside government to deliver services that meet customers’ needs. As the makeup of New Zealand changes, we must change to make sure we can keep meeting our customers’ expectations and continue to make it easy for them to pay and receive the right amounts. Our customers WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS With the Ministry of Social Development, we distributed $3 billion in entitlements to support working families. CHILD SUPPORT We collected $467 million from more than 156,000 parents who pay child support. We distributed $281 million to carers. The balance is retained by the Government to help offset the cost of benefits paid. KIWISAVER We collected contributions and transferred $8 billion to KiwiSaver scheme providers. As at 30 June 2021, over 3.1 million people were enrolled in KiwiSaver. STUDENT LOANS We jointly administer this programme with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). We had approximately 680,000 student loan customers and collected $1.5 billion in repayments.

We made $503 million in payments to approximately 50,000 parents. \* Figures for the tax year ended March 2021 are not available for this publication because customers have until April 2022 to file their 2021 returns. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 11 Our vision Our objectives Our objectives are to: >Grow voluntary compliance by making it easier for people to get it right. >Reduce customer compliance costs and the costs of administering the revenue system. >Make government policy changes faster and more cost-effectively. Government priorities The Government has three over-arching priorities: >Keeping New Zealanders safe from COVID-19. >Accelerating the recovery and rebuild from COVID-19. >Laying the foundations for the future, including addressing key issues such as climate change, housing affordability, and child poverty. We contribute to achieving these priorities by collecting and distributing money, making our services accessible and easy to use, and working with other agencies, including sharing information with them, to deliver better services and outcomes for New Zealanders. A world-class revenue organisation recognised for service and excellence. We make it simple and easy for our customers to meet their obligations and receive the payments they are entitled to. Our strategic intentions Delivering the tax policy work programme The Government’s tax policy work programme (TPWP) sets out our policy focus. The work areas are: >Taxation of residential investment property. This work will include making changes to our tax settings to improve housing affordability for first home buyers by dampening investor demand for existing property. >Tax administration. This work will focus on leveraging the assets and capabilities developed through our business transformation programme and will include a green paper on options for tax administration reform. >Sustainable economy and the environment. We will work with other agencies to develop a framework for when to use taxes or other charges for environmental and resource issues, review existing tax provisions to ensure they are not biased against environmentally friendly investment and behaviour, and contribute to cross-agency advice on environmental proposals. >International tax. The international tax framework needs to adapt to shifts in the global economy, including increased cross-border activity and digitalisation. This work will include a multilateral solution to the challenges posed by the digital economy to international taxation and consideration of a digital service tax. >Integrity of the tax system. This work will include measures to support the 39% top personal income tax rate, the collection of information about trusts, and a new Tax Principles Act (which will involve the establishment of a reporting framework against a set of principles to measure fairness of the tax system). >COVID-19 response. We will work with other agencies to make any changes required to the range of COVID-19 response measures. What we want to achieve E whai ana mātou i te aha 12 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 >Stewardship. This work will include a review of fringe benefit tax to determine if it’s fit for purpose, a long- term insights briefing, and research work involving the collection of information on the level of tax paid by high wealth individuals. >Maintaining the tax system. Tax legislation needs to be regularly maintained and updated in response to changing technology, business practices, jurisprudence, or other factors. Our remedial work programme will focus on priorities in this area. >Non-discretionary other agency work. This work involves other agencies’ work programmes that have tax implications or delivery implications for us. Examples of this work include local government reforms, the Three Waters project, and charities review. >Social policy. We have a significant role to play in the delivery of social policy. This work includes the Ministry of Social Development led welfare reform programme (which includes a review of Working for Families), and the development of a social unemployment insurance scheme. Supporting Government priorities Overall, a strong revenue system contributes to making New Zealand a great place for people to live and work. We have had a significant focus on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and expect to play a substantial role in supporting New Zealand’s recovery in the years ahead. We will continue to support customers to pay and receive the right amounts by helping make things easy for them such as setting up instalments, claiming reliefs, and managing the impacts of the pandemic on their businesses or personal finances. Ensuring trust in and the integrity of the revenue system So that New Zealanders continue to provide us with accurate information, pay their taxes, and claim only what they are entitled to, it’s important they believe: >When I pay my tax, I’m doing a good thing (and that’s what people like me do). >When I’m trying to do the right things, Inland Revenue will help me. >When someone else is trying to do the wrong thing, Inland Revenue will find them. We protect the integrity of the revenue system by helping customers get things right as well as correcting them when they get it wrong. We: >Make it easy to pay the right amounts on time and to receive the right payments and difficult not to. >Fix problems when they happen so that customers understand where they have gone wrong and know what to do next time. >Make tax and payments part of business processes or life events where possible. To do this we look at everything from policy settings, the design of products and services, the advice and education we provide, through to how and when we enforce the law. There is a range of ways we can respond when things go wrong, from educating customers new to the system through to investigating and taking people to court where necessary. Finishing our transformation programme Transformation set out to help New Zealanders by reducing effort for customers, improving compliance, making policy changes faster and more cost-effectively, improving the resilience of our systems, and making us more efficient. The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. Customers have moved to digital channels, many transactions are processed in near real-time, and policies and processes have been simplified. This has meant better experiences for customers and new ways of doing things for Inland Revenue. Transformation has been far more than an upgrade of technology. The final release of the programme will move child support to new systems and processes and upgrade our online services. We will then decommission all our old systems and processes. The programme will be complete by 30 June 2022. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 13 Making the most of our new capabilities While the transformation programme will come to an end, Inland Revenue will continue to embed the changes made over the last few years. We will continue to look for opportunities to modernise the revenue system and make the most of our new capabilities: >Self-service options for customers mean they can do more for themselves with less effort and without needing to contact us. This frees us up to help customers who cannot use digital services or have complex needs. >Responsive and resilient systems mean we can respond more quickly and innovatively with new policies and products when required, including collaborating with others on design and implementation. We can operate remotely even when there are disruptions to our offices. >More complete and accurate data combined with our ability to bring information from different places together means we can better understand customers’ needs and risks to the system. We can tailor services depending on customers’ understanding and capability. This is helping us to decide when we should proactively contact customers and how we should communicate with them. >Digital connections with third parties make it easy for the appropriate information to be exchanged between systems. This is reducing effort and re-work for both customers and Inland Revenue. Many new products or services can now be implemented much more quickly than previously as our systems are flexible. We showed this in the way we responded to COVID-19, with new products made available within weeks. We will continue to work with our public and private sector partners to deliver on wider outcomes. This could range from sharing our expertise through to changing how public services are delivered. For example, we can share information with other agencies or organisations, with appropriate security permissions, to help them deliver services. The portal we put in place to support the Ministry of Social Development to administer the wage subsidy shows how this approach can work in practice. Working with others to improve outcomes The Public Service Act 2020 aims to create a more modern, agile, unified Public Service that can deliver across agency boundaries to wrap services around New Zealanders’ needs. We already work with many other agencies and external partners to deliver outcomes for customers. In the private sector, we work with a wide range of organisations, including tax intermediaries and software providers, to ensure that requirements are simple, can be integrated into existing business processes and systems as far as possible, and make it as easy as possible for people to pay and receive the right amounts. In the public sector, with the Ministry of Social Development, we distribute Working for Families payments. We jointly administer student loans with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). We administer paid parental leave for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. We also have a range of information-sharing arrangements in place, including with the Department of Internal Affairs, the New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. While we are committed to playing our part in realising a more joined-up and citizen-focused Public Service, opportunities need to be a good fit with our capabilities and balanced against ensuring we continue to deliver Government priorities and our core business. We must also take care that we do not put at risk our stewardship of the revenue system. We will develop frameworks and processes to ensure that decisions made about the role we play in initiatives that cross agency boundaries are transparent. Our areas of strength are: >Delivering services based on core information – particularly income and customer data. >Collection and payment of money / processing at scale. >High-volume, digital transaction processing – not services that rely on high levels of discretion and/or an extensive customer-facing presence. >Delivering large-scale, consistent, rules-based initiatives that leverage the capabilities of our commercial off-the- shelf systems. >Analytical tools and capability – including ‘what-if ’ analysis and risk assessment. 14 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Putting the customer at the centre of everything we do >We anticipate and proactively support key events in our customers’ lives at the right time. >We use customer insights to inform activities. >Our services are seamless, and tax and social policy are integrated into customers’ lives. >We partner with others to deliver service excellence to customers – from policy design, to education, to audit. >We make it easy for customers to get it right and we reduce compliance costs and effort. Our strategy is to make it easy for our customers to deal with us and to pay and receive the right amounts, whatever their circumstances. It has six interconnected strands. We will continue to focus on modernising the revenue system over the next four years to further improve how we serve New Zealanders. How we will achieve our objectives Pēhea ai te whakatutuki i ā mātou whāinga Customer Through transformation we have become more customer-centric in terms of how we deliver services and evolve services to better meet customers’ needs. We have made considerable progress in putting our customers at the centre of everything we do. We will continue to improve customers’ experiences and decrease their effort when dealing with tax and social policy. We have four ongoing areas of focus: Organising ourselves around our customers and outcomes. Our culture, capabilities, and processes are helping our people to bring a greater understanding of our customers into the design and delivery of services. Building our understanding of our customers and using insights to continuously inform and improve our activities. This includes using continuous learning loops to improve as we go. Delivering Mauri Ora Te Whānau – wellbeing of the family. Delivering customer experiences that reduce customers’ compliance cost and effort and increase their trust in us. We want to provide tailored, timely and seamless services that are integrated across government and other business partners. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 15 Understanding our external environment and positioning ourselves accordingly. We take a holistic view, adapt to changes, and innovate. Extending our boundaries. We continue to collaborate with others in the public and private sectors to make dealing with government easy. Adapting the way we work. We engage with and deliver results in partnership with others. We reduce or remove barriers that stop us using information, knowledge, and expertise to deliver value. 12 3 We work with external parties to innovate, gain insight, and achieve wider economic and social outcomes > We work with others to deliver mutual benefit. > We use our information, knowledge, and expertise to develop our understanding of customers. > We leverage our capabilities, information, and resources to support broad outcomes. External collaboration New Zealanders benefit from Inland Revenue working collaboratively as part of the broader Public Service and with the private sector. Our customers cross boundaries and borders and to provide better support and deliver a seamless experience, we need to work across those boundaries and borders too. There are three broad ways we are bringing this about: Our decisions and actions – for delivering today and shaping our future – are intelligence-led >We understand the information we collect, and the insights and intelligence we generate through the knowledge and experiences of our people, need to be managed and shared appropriately. >We use information and insights to create intelligence we can act on. >Intelligence drives our decision-making, including policy and service design, so we know where and when to direct resources to realise value. Information and intelligence We have made significant progress in three areas: data and analytics, information and knowledge management, and data and information governance. We will continue to drive an integrated approach to help ensure the integrity of the revenue system by supporting more informed policy advice, faster and higher-quality decision-making at scale, and targeting resources to the areas that provide the best value. We will continue to focus on building the data and information management capability of our people, and delegating decision-making so that our people can make well-informed decisions. We will: Make best use of our information and insights at scale to provide increasing value, including participating in and shaping government-wide forums and initiatives. Automate processes to deliver personalised interactions to support compliance and create proactive, risk- based customer interventions. Build on and make best use of our tools and processes, and the capabilities of our people to access, analyse, and use data, information, and knowledge to drive quality decision-making. 123 16 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Digital We fully embrace our place in the digitally connected world >We make it easy to collaborate with customers, agencies, and others. >We design and make changes quickly. >Customers can easily access secure digital services anywhere, any time. >We encourage, empower, and upskill our people to make best use of digital ways of working. The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now largely in place. Customers now have digital services for all taxes and the social policies we administer. This makes it easier for customers to do what they need to do without needing to call us. Businesses, employers, and tax intermediaries are increasingly managing their tax obligations through software. As part of the final release, we upgraded the digital services that all our customers use. Digital services are better meeting the expectations of our customers and our own people and enabling them to connect more easily with others and share useful information quickly. We will mitigate the risk of digital exclusion by involving customers early in the design of new services and consider where alternative channels / support are required. The key ways we are implementing our digital vision are: Using flexible and extendible digital solutions to provide better self-service options to our customers. Using analytics to understand customers’ shifting patterns of digital interaction to support compliance and improve customers’ ability to self-serve. Providing enabling services to digital service providers and intermediaries for the benefit of customers. Working with our customers, our people, our business partners, and other agencies to continually develop our approach and respond to innovative ideas. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 17 Policy agility Policy change is faster, cheaper, and better – fit for a changing world >Our policy design is proactive, coherent, and integrated, from idea generation and advice, through to implementation. >We implement policy decisions speedily and smoothly. >We deliver high-quality advice that is outcome-focused, realistic about the impacts and based on good information and analysis. >We are a trusted and credible voice that shapes and delivers government and system outcomes. >We use innovative, flexible, and creative practices to design policy, supported by strong economic, social, and wellbeing frameworks and broad consultation. Greater policy agility helps us to meet our regulatory stewardship responsibilities by ensuring we are outcomes-focused, proactive, and collaborative. It applies across the end-to-end process, from idea generation, through to policy development, implementation, and evaluation. We will continue to develop improved ways of working, with multi-disciplinary teams working effectively together. We will retain and grow the capabilities our people need to become policy professionals of the future and improve our use of information and analytics so that our policy advice is high quality, timely and evidence-based. We will focus on making the right connections across government, to support a strong inter-generational and wellbeing approach. We are lifting our policy agility through: Building our focus on regulatory and cross-system collaboration. Maximising the advantages of our new technology platform, operating model, and ways of working, through a cycle of evaluation, learning, and improvement. Lifting information and analytical capability to enable enhanced modelling of impacts (including economic, revenue, compliance, behavioural, and administrative impacts) and better evaluation of policy. Putting in place a focus on gaining a better understanding of Māori needs and perspectives through the development of an enhanced engagement approach. 1234 18 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 People Working as part of Inland Revenue is unique, exciting, fulfilling, and career-enhancing Our vision means: >We value individuals and diversity of thought and capability. >We find, develop, and deploy people on the basis of their capabilities, which are a mix of skills, knowledge, experience, and attitudes. >We design roles to be adaptable, interesting, and empowering. >We work with other organisations to develop fulfilling career journeys in, through, and beyond Inland Revenue. We have established new approaches to role design and performance management, new learning and development practices, and workplace tools and technology that enable a highly capable, diverse, motivated workforce. Our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy supports our aspiration to have an inclusive culture where people from all walks of life can achieve their full potential. We will continue to build on what has been achieved including: Maturing our Diversity and Inclusion work programme, aligned with Te Kawa Mataaho (Public Service Commission) and Papa Pounamu (the Chief Executive governance group for the Public Service-wide diversity and inclusion work programme) expectations. Building Te Tiriti o Waitangi experience and our cultural competence in te ao Māori to fulfil our responsibilities as a Tr e a t y p a r t n e r. Embedding our new operating model to enable a cohesive end-to-end people experience. Using insight about the capability and aspirations of our people to deliver on Inland Revenue’s and the wider Public Service’s objectives. 1234 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 19 We are committed to meeting our Tiriti o Waitangi obligations as a government agency and partner in the Māori Crown relationship. Our Māhutonga programme aims to integrate Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Māori principles, concepts, and practices into the way we work. Māhutonga sets out the direction we want to take with our organisational culture and our Māori customers. It includes a number of strands of activity, ranging from building the Māori cultural capability of our people, to enhancing our engagement and service delivery approach with Māori. A core part of our Māhutonga work is building our Māori cultural capability. We are developing Te Arapiki, a stair-cased learning approach that aligns to the expectations set out by Te Arawhiti (the Office for Māori Crown Relations) for all public servants. Te Mata o Te Arero is our Māori language plan which supports the revitalisation of te reo Māori. We are committed to supporting the use of te reo Māori in our workplace. The service delivery strand of Māhutonga includes Mauri Ora Te Whānau. This is a statement of our intent to improve whānau wellbeing through taking a whānau-centred approach to our work with Māori customers. Our research, including the Māori Customer Landscape, is helping us to bring whānau, hapū and iwi perspectives into our work. By exploring the wider context of the Māori world view and perspectives, we can better understand what is important to our customers. The appropriate application of this understanding helps us to think differently about the types of services that will help best meet their needs and improve outcomes for them. We are in the process of establishing a panel of Māori experts who can advise us on how best to engage on policy issues of significance to Māori so that our tax and social policy advice to Ministers is more informed and better reflects Māori perspectives. Delivering Māhutonga – our approach to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and working with Māori Making it easier for people to get things right and harder to get wrong We will continue to focus on helping customers most in need of our assistance to get the payments they are entitled to and to meet their payment obligations. We will continue to be empathetic to and supportive of customers who are struggling, to help them do the right thing. However, one size does not fit all and we will continue to investigate where necessary. For example, our community education approach provides new business owners with the information they need at the time they set their business up, to help increase their resilience. We are also working with other agencies to ensure that customers get consistent messages and find dealing with government as easy as possible. This will help support a more unified Public Service that has customers at its centre. For new products and services, we are increasingly building in checks at the start. This saves time for both customers and Inland Revenue by stopping incorrect applications and ensuring people receive only the payments they are entitled to. We can quickly collate and make sense of the large variety of data we collect and be more proactive when we see things that are not right. We can move more quickly to help customers get back on track and tailor how we work with customers to help them pay and receive the right amounts. Increasingly third parties, such as tax intermediaries and software providers, are involved in delivering services to customers. We will continue to work with others in both the public and private sectors to improve outcomes for customers. For example, we will continue to work with the Ministry of Social Development on better processes for people moving in and out of work and to help those who have debt with both agencies. 20 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Becoming more diverse and inclusive Meeting the diverse needs of New Zealand’s people is important to us. Having a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture enables us to better understand and respond to our customers’ needs. The varied perspectives of our people will help us design and deliver the right services for customers. We are committed to ensuring a diversity of views and have a comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. Our approach aligns with the Public Service Act 2020 and guidance from Te Kawa Mataaho (Public Service Commission) and Papa Pounamu expectations. We published our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan in 2020 Our strategy aligns with Papa Pounamu expectations The Diversity and Inclusion Group is made up of representatives from our diversity networks and from the business Māori Network Tagata Pasifika Network He Toa Takatini Rainbow Network Women’s Network Diversability Network Multicultural Network Addressing gender and ethnic pay gaps We will address gender and ethnic representation by design rather than expecting it to happen by default. Our Gender Pay Gap Action Plan has five key areas: >People analytics and insights: Regularly measuring and publishing progress on the gender and ethnic pay gap, representation and pay progression to drive visibility, understanding, and accountability. >Attracting a diverse pool of applicants to improve representation of groups at all levels and areas. >Ensuring our candidate selection processes are free from bias. >Career and pay: Supporting our people’s career development. >Whānau friendly: Being a whānau-friendly employer and flexible by default, where flexible options are equally available to men and women and do not undermine career development or pay. Diversity and inclusion at Inland Revenue We are delivering a comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Our Diversity and Inclusion Group shapes Inland Revenue’s initiatives Our people have set up diversity and inclusion networks STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 21 Enhancing the capabilities and technical skills of our people To deliver the best services for our customers, we will continue to invest in our people by building their knowledge and capability in areas such as policy agility, tax technical expertise, and digital skills. Our move to capability-based roles and our new tools and technology mean we can be more agile and resilient, and work more efficiently. Multi-disciplinary teams and devolved decision-making enable us to resolve issues for customers more quickly. Our capability-based approach is integrated into our role design, recruitment, development, and talent management. This approach is based around 12 people capabilities that demonstrate the skills, knowledge, experience, and attitudes needed for a future-fit workforce that is adaptive and responsive to change. Our people capabilities recognise that technical skills and knowledge are critical to delivering our services. Rapid changes in customer demand, technology, and the future of work mean transferrable skills and behaviours are also equally important. We are committed to embedding and evolving the capability of our people through: >Designing and delivering tax and social policy learning that maintains and enhances our technical skills and knowledge. >Building our cultural competence in line with our Māhutonga and diversity and inclusion goals. >Planning and managing our workforce in a way that aligns our future capability needs with the development and aspirations of our people. Monitoring and responding to changes in our environment Across all of our work, we regularly assess how our environment is changing to identify trends, risks, and opportunities. We expect the following to influence our work for the foreseeable future: >The global economy – emerging labour markets, national protectionism, climate change mitigation, changes in how people buy goods and services, and the ongoing impacts from COVID-19 will affect New Zealand, including trade, the economy, and key industries. >The role of tax and transfers – citizens’ expectations of participation in and perceptions of the fairness of the system, and what other countries are considering. >Social change – a broad area that includes expectations of the Māori Treaty partner for the Māori Crown relationship, demographic changes including population growth and distribution, and shifts in attitudes and behaviours towards privacy, trust in public institutions, and the role of media and social media. >Increasing levels of inequality – the drivers of inequality and what this means for what we do and the outcomes we are expected to achieve. >The impact of technology changes on revenue collection – advances in technology are changing how people connect with each other, are enabling a wider range of participants to play a role in the revenue system, enabling businesses and whole sectors to change how they operate, and are shifting payment systems and transactions to the cloud. Cybercrime and terrorism will have implications for revenue collection. 22 STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 Customer and Compliance Services – Individuals >Makes tax compliance simpler by giving advice and support to individuals, families, tax agents and micro-business customers, including not-for-profit organisations. >Takes a ‘Right from the Start’ approach to assist our customers to get their interactions right, intervene early when they’re getting it wrong and takes action when people choose not to do the right thing. This helps ensure everyone pays and receives the right entitlements. Customer and Compliance Services – Business >Provides certainty and accuracy around complex and global tax compliance arrangements for small-to-medium-sized enterprises and significant enterprises. >Connects with a range of business and delivery partners, representative bodies, government and international agencies to deliver joined-up services and reduce costs to customers and government. >Also uses a ‘Right from the Start’ approach, including providing assurance to customers on significant tax issues and large-scale transactions. >Assists our customers to get their interactions right, intervenes early when they’re getting it wrong and takes action when businesses choose not to do the right thing. >Provides tax technical and legal support to Inland Revenue. Information and Intelligence Services >Helps us keep customers at the heart of everything we do. >Uses data insights and intelligence to help understand and influence customer behaviour.

Enterprise Design and Integrity >Develops our strategic direction and provides advice and guidance to ensure we achieve the outcomes intended. >Integrates our planning, prioritisation, performance reporting, and investment management activity. Managing our organisation effectively It is essential that we continue to be a trusted, effective, and efficient government agency. We will continue to ensure our organisation and governance structure is fit for purpose and that any risks to our business are managed. Our organisational structure We are organised around our customers. Our people work collaboratively across business groups, sharing information, combining skills and knowledge, to implement government priorities and improve outcomes for customers. The table below provides a summary of each of our business groups. STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 23 Our governance Our governance bodies set our strategic direction and oversee our progress.

Managing our risks The Strategic Governance Board oversees risk management and other governance bodies monitor specific areas of risk and performance. The Risk and Assurance Committee provides independent oversight. We have an Enterprise Risk Management Framework based on international standards for identifying and managing risks. We regularly discuss and update our enterprise risks, and the triggers that could cause each risk to eventuate, the consequences that could result, and the controls in place to reduce the likelihood of the risk occurring and the consequences if it did. Our current enterprise risks are: STATEMENT OF INTENT 2021–25 25 Our outcomes are the long-term results we want to achieve. Our customer outcomes show the difference we want to make. The measures for our three customer outcomes indicate our effectiveness in enabling our customers to get it right from the start. Our services are what we deliver for our customers and stakeholders. Our operational performance is assessed through our output measures. These measures ensure we remain on track to achieve our impacts and outcomes. Our organisational health is about how we use our resources to deliver for our customers and government and ensure our performance is sustainable. Our organisational health measures let us know how our people are doing, as well as our systems, assets, investments, and finances. Our culture is what is important to us in how we work. We have woven measures of integrity through all layers of our Performance Measurement Framework to reflect our commitment to protecting the integrity of the revenue system.

Foreword from the Minister of Revenue Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake has a key role to play in supporting the Government to achieve its priorities. The areas the Government is looking to IR to actively contribute to are: ›Maintaining a stable tax and social policy system that is fair and works for all New Zealanders and that the public can have trust and confidence in. ›Rebuilding the economy so that New Zealand is economically stronger, more productive and higher performing. ›Delivering public services so they are more efficient, effective, and responsive. Raising revenue as efficiently as possible will support the economy to grow and reduce effort for individuals and businesses. Making it eas y for people to understand and comply with their tax and social policy obligations will reduce the chance of them making a mistake. Paying taxes and claiming entitlements should not be a burden on people who are trying to do the right thing. As well as continuing to support the majority who do the right thing, the Government is also focused on ensuring all New Zealanders pay their share. I expect IR to continue to take a firm line with those who choose not to comply, and to have a strong focus on collecting unpaid taxes and loans, and on the areas where there are known integrity risks, for example the cash economy, organised crime, and overseas- based student loan borrowers. I expect to see performance measures for compliance improve as a result. Every dollar that is not collected is a dollar that cannot be invested in other areas such as health and education. Many opportunities to build tax and social policy compliance into everyday processes will be in working with third parties, particularly in a more digital economy. IR is focused on putting in place the necessary foundations and safeguards to enable more customers to meet their obligations in the systems they naturally use to run their businesses or live their live s. Good administration is underpinned by good tax policy. Making policy objectives as clear as possible, engaging early, and supporting the generic tax policy process will provide all those with an interest in New Zealand’s tax and social policy system with a strong degree of certainty. The tax and social policy work programme will focus on simplification, reducing compliance costs for taxpayers, and increasing productivity for New Zealand. Finally, the Government has made it clear public money should be spent carefully. IR is playing its part by finding ways to deliver more within its existing funding. I am satisfied that the information IR has provided on its strategic intentions is consistent with the policies and performance expectations of the Government. Hon Simon Watts Minister of Revenue 12 November 2024 Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 5 Introduction from the Commissioner and Chief Executive At Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake our focus is on improving oranga (wellbeing in its widest sense) for current and future generations through our work. It means we need to think about how we improve wellbeing for future generations through what we do today. We make our biggest contribution to oranga through economic activities including collecting and distributing money. We know that wh ile most people try to do the right thing, some do not. For customers who struggle to get things right, whether due to difficult circumstances or accidently, we’ll work with them to he lp the m get back on track. For those who deliberately choose not to do the right thing or choose not to pay what they owe, w e’ll increase our efforts to actively investigate and take enforcement action where we need to. With the analytical capabilities we have, we can identify non-compliance at an early stage and address it. New Zealanders can expect to see us use the full range of options we have to make sure that people comply with their obligations and pay the tax they owe. We’ll also continue to focus on how we can make things as easy as possible for people to pay and receive the right amounts with as litt le effort as possible. We’ve ma de good progress with making things simpler for our individual customers and we will be shifting our foc us to making things simpler for businesses over the next few years so it’s easier for them to meet their obligations. We don’t do any of this on our own and recognise we’re part of a wider system. Increasingly, third parties, such as tax intermediaries and software providers, are involved in delivering services to customers. We will work more closely with them to collaboratively design digital solutions that reduce effort for customers. We also partner with other agencies in the public sector to ensure New Zealanders get the services they are entitled to. We recognise we have capabilities that could be used more broadly across the public sector to improve outcomes for New Zealanders, for example sharing more of the information we hold. This is an area we will do more work in to ensure we contribute as much value as we can. As well as delivering our day-to-day services, we will continue to look longer term to ensure we fulfil our stewardship obligations under the Public Service Act 2020. Making sure we have strong foundations in place is the first step in ensuring we have the capability and resources we need to contribute to the debate on longer-term issues and bring a long-term perspective to the issues of integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the systems we’re responsible for. Everything starts and ends with our people and we will only achieve our aspiration and outcomes through their work. We want to be seen as a great place to work so we can attract and develop the capable, diverse, motivated people we need to be able to continue to serve New Zealanders effectively. Chief Executive’s Statement of Responsibility In signing this Statement, I acknowledge that I am responsible for the information on the strategic intentions of Inland Revenue. This information has been prepared in accordance with section 38 and section 40 of the Public Finance Act 1989. Peter Mersi Commissioner and Chief Executive 12 November 2024 Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What we are here to do How we describe what we aspire to achieve and the role we play reflects the breadth of our work. Our aspiration – what we’re here to do Our aspiration is based around oranga (wellbeing in its widest sense). Improving oranga for current and future generations We’ll know we’re successfully moving towards achieving our aspiration when: Revenue is available to fund government programmes and services. People receive their entitlements. Oranga increases when we work with other organisations. The intergenerational oranga of the people of New Zealand is supported by our active stewardship. These are the outcomes we want to achieve for everyone in New Zealand over time. We make our biggest contribution through economic activities including collecting and distributing money. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Our roles – how we deliver The core services we deliver are: ›Administering the assessment and collection of tax revenue and social policy programmes. ›Providing end-to-end policy advice. ›Collaborating with other agencies to simplify and integrate government services. To deliver these services, we have three key roles. Being effective and efficient This means doing what we do in the best ways for the best results and is what most of our people focus on every da y. Active stewardship This is about actively making sure what we're responsible for is fit for purpose today and tomorrow. Making a broader contribution We will work across the public service to deliver more for New Zealand. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 8 How we perform our rol es We act impartially and independently to administer and protect the integrity of the tax and social policy system. The Commissioner has statutory independence from Ministers and is responsible for: ›Collecting the highest net revenue over time ›Administering social policy ›Interpreting tax law ›Making decisions about where our resources should be focused ›Our performance. We advise the Government on tax policy and the social policies that we administer, working together with other public sector agencies where appropriate. This includes advising the Government on international tax issues and helping to develop and implement New Zealand’s international tax legislation. We manage and run the tax and social policy system by working with many other stakeholders. To work efficiently, we rely on other public sector agencies, intermediaries who advise customers about their obligations and entitlements, employers, KiwiSaver providers, financial institutions and community groups. We’re also part of a digital ecosystem that includes service providers such as payroll software companies who enable customers to manage their obligations from within their own systems. Our customers – who we serve Tax affects everyone and social policy programmes affect most New Zealanders too. As well as collecting revenue, we’re responsible for administering a range of social policy products including Working for Families, child support, KiwiSaver, student loans, paid parental leave, unclaimed money, Family Boost, and support payments that rely on income information to determine eligibility. Our customers include all people earning income in New Zealand and people who live overseas but have tax affairs and/or social policy obligations her e. The money we collect helps pay for the essential services that all New Zealanders benefit from such as healthcare, social policy payments, education and protecting our environment. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 9 The services we deliver OUR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS It’s important to our individual customers that we: › send annual tax assessments out quickly and explain things clearly › help people pay what they should on time › make it straightforward to set up a plan for repaying an overdue debt. 3.5 million customers received an automatically issued individual income tax assessment in the tax year to March 2023. 1 3.4 million KiwiSaver members were enrolled in the scheme at 30 June 2024. We transferred $10.4 billion to scheme providers to invest in 2023–24. 618,000 student loan borrowers made $1.6 billion in repayments in 2023–24. $328 million in donation tax credits went to 313,000 customers in 2023–24. FAMILIES AND WHĀNAU Families and whānau want us to: › give them certainty about the payments they receive from week to week › take the time to understand their situations and work through options for receiving entitlements or paying child support. Along with the Ministry of Social Development Te Manatū Whakahiato Ora, IR distributed $3.1 billion in net entitlements to support working families in 2023–24. 145,000 children were supported by the Child Support Scheme. $480 million in child support was collected from more than 127,000 parents in 2023–24 and $413 million was distributed to carers. $642 million in paid parental leave payments went to around 54,000 new parents in 2023–24. BUSINESSES Providing certainty and clarity for businesses is critical so they can manage their tax obligations. It’s important that we: › help new businesses get their tax right from the start › reduce the effort and uncertainties involved in paying tax › understand their circumstances if they’re going through difficulties › make it easy to advise us about any significant loss of income or set up an instalment arrange to pay a debt. 1 Figures for the tax year ended March 2024 are not available for this Statement of Intent because some customers who use tax agents have until April 2025 to file their 2024 returns. 250,000 employers filed more than 7.2 million employer information returns in 2023–24. 435,000 company returns were filed in the 2023 tax year. 1 708,000 customers were registered for GST at some point in 2023–24 . They filed 3.1 9 million GS T returns. 2 million income tax returns were filed in the 2023 tax year. 1 Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 10 What we want to achieve Government priorities The Government’s priorities for the revenue portfolio are : › Agreeing a tax and social policy programme that reduces compliance costs, addresses integrity risks, and advances the digital ecosystem. › Delivering our core business more efficiently and effectively. Delivering the tax and social policy work programme The Government’s tax and social policy work programme sets out our policy focus. The priorities in the wo rk programme are: › Supporting economic growth and productivity. › Raising revenue to fund growth and productivity enhancing measures. › Enhancing the fairness and integrity of the tax and social policy system. The focus areas in the work programme are : › Simplifying tax to reduce compliance costs for individuals and businesses. › Addressing integrity risks to increase customer compliance and improve the collection of unpaid taxes owed. › Advancing the digital ecosystem, including increased simplicity for customers through enabling digital intermediaries and co-designing solutions with businesses and intermediaries. Collecting revenue We have a legal obligation to collect the highest net revenue over time keeping in mind the resources we have available, the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, and costs incurred by participants in the system. Most of the revenue we collect comes from customers who voluntarily pay their tax on time. So me revenue takes more effort to collect and we respond in a range of ways when people choose not to do the right thing Our intention is to grow the proportion of tax revenue paid on time and in full, act early where we see non-compliance, and reduce opportunities for non-compliance. Our ‘right from the start’ approach aims to make it eas y to comply and hard to avoid. To do this, we’ll continue to focus on making it easy for customers meet their obligations. We’ll continue to offer to help customers who are struggling and trying to do the right thing and increase our efforts to actively investigate where necessary and take enforcement action where we need to. Our systems do a lot of the heavy lifting and our sophisticated analytical capabilities mean we can move quickly to help customers get back on track. We’ll continue to build compliance into our systems and processes to ensure we collect revenue as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 11 Managing overdue debt Our aim is to prevent customers from getting into debt. When they do, we work with them to decide the best option for dealing with their debt based on their circumstances. To ensure customers do not remain in debt for a long time, we work with th em to help them pay debt off quickly. We do this by ›Understanding our customers’ needs and behaviours through continuously monitoring their experiences and outcomes in real time and sharing information across government. ›Identifying who is likely to need our help by taking a risk informed approach to understanding customers’ financial health and capability and their compliance behaviours and identifying who is unlikely to self-correct and less likely to pay. ›Reaching high-risk customers by tailoring our interventions and interactions based on customers’ financial health and past compliance behaviours. ›Ensuring policy settings enable a customer’s entire circumstances to be considered when dealing with debt and recognise the long-term value of a customer, smoothing out variations in cashflow. ›Supporting our people to interact with customers in debt confidently, consistently, and transparently. Addressing integrity risks Maintaining the integrity of the revenue system through encouraging high levels of voluntary compliance remains a cornerstone of what we do. Customers paying and claiming the right amounts of their own accord is the most effective way to ensure compliance. To support compliance, we look at everything from policy settings, the design of products and services, the advice and education we provide, through to the campaigns and interventions we run, including how we enforce the law when we see non-compliance. Our aim is to collect and pay the right amounts at the right time, and work with those who are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations to get them back on track. This starts with good policy design. Early engagement through the Generic Tax Policy Process is critical to designing policy that will have high levels of compliance. We design our systems and processes to stop a lot of non-compliance from happening, with pre - population and in- bu ilt checks that sto p errors in real time. Creating systems and processes that are as intuitive, simple and low effort as possible supports most people to get things right. When people get things wrong, we respond in a range of ways. Enforcement activities such as investigations, audit and prosecutions are an important part of our wo rk and we will continue to increase our efforts in these areas. While our systems can deal with less complex enforcement activities, human intervention is required when customers do not respond or deliberately avoid their obligations. We’ll continue to take firm action when we see wrongdoing and fraud and target our resources to the areas of highest risk. Our debt performance measures will reflect the customer outcomes we’re aiming to achieve and enable us to quickly adjust our activity. We will hav e measures that are complemented by a comprehensive monitoring plan and quickly enable us to see anything unexpected and put the right actions in place. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 12 Being fiscally sustainable All government departments are expected to deliver their work within their current funding levels for the period of this Statement of Intent. To do that, we’ll ensure that all parts of IR are fit-for -purpose, focused on what’s important and working efficiently and effectively. We need our people to focus on doing the work that we are prioritising, particularly around compliance. Everyone across IR contributes to this work in some way. Each year, we’ll develop a performance plan which will set out how we will achieve a sustainable fiscal outlook while delivering efficient, effective, and responsive public services. We’ll continue to look for efficiency gains across all areas of our work and carefully consider where we invest in our capability and capacity. Reducing compliance effort for customers Micro and small to medium sized businesses (SMEs), which make up the majority of New Zealand firms, face the highest compliance costs relative to the amount of tax they pay. Smaller businesses will be the main focus of our work to reduce compliance costs. Our aim is to ensure customers meet their obligations and we support this by making interactions with us as smooth and low effort as possible. This includes proactively engaging with those wh o make mistakes, refining our rules to make sur e we onl y hold up the returns we need to, and streamlining the notifications we send to customers so they’re clear what’s expected of them. We’re also working to improve how we support businesses who are just starting out and how we support growing businesses to ensure they start out and remain compliant. Harnessing the power of the digital ecosystem We know it’s important to build strong relationships with p articipants in the digital ecosystem and work with them to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of ta x and social policy administration. We will achieve this in stages. Customers in natural systems The use of natural systems 2 supports compliance by making it e asier for customers. We’ll integrate rules int o the ecosystem and reduce the n eed for reporting tha t o ccurs outside of n atural systems. Expand the digital border By enabling a wider range of third parties to connect with u s digitally, wi th ap propriate s afeguards in place, we’ll be able to improve delivery of services to the customers they represent. Tax just happens Customers’ expectations of the government, di gital interactions and data a vailability w ill continue to shift. D igitised and automated processes, with seamless interactions across agencies will be expected as the norm. Customer expectations, enabling technology and regulation will come together to e nable reporting and payments to happen at the s ame time, in near r eal -time. 2 The different systems that customers use to run their businesses, make t ransactions, and communicate. For example, p ayroll systems used by e mployers. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 13 Delivering on our intentions We’ll continue to make sure our organisation is fit for purpose and manage any risks to our business.

Our Enterprise Risk Management Framework is based on international standards for identifying and managing risks. All enterprise risks are monitored by our Executive Leadership Team who meet regularly to review them and consider if any changes are required. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 14 Our current enterprise risks are: ENTERPRISE RISK SOME OF OUR CONTROLS RISK 1: Failure to deliver for customers or government priorities › Our executive governance framework. › Regular meetings with Ministers and external stakeholders. › Our enterprise planning process. › Our initiative management lifecycle, which sets out how we manage change. › Our enterprise performance, including the Performance Measurement Framework.

Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 15 How we will achieve our aspiration and outcomes Our aspiration, roles and outcomes are enduring. What will change is the work we do and how we do it to achieve our outcomes and move us closer to our aspiration. We’ll regularly refresh our strategy with small, iterative updates, rather than reviewing it in depth every 5 to 10 years. THE DIRECTION WE’RE HEADING IN We’ve identified the areas we’ll focus on as we work towards our aspiration and outcomes. Keeping customers at the centre We have a strong focus on customers and will continue to put their needs at the centre of our thinking when designing and implementing products and services by: ›Improving customers’ experiences when they interact with us and other agencies. ›Reducing the need for customers to contact us unnecessarily. ›Building trust in IR and government institutions. ›Growing our organisational and people capabilities to improve how we deliver to our Māori customers who represent a growing part of the New Zealand economy. Supporting ou r people We want to continue to be seen as a great place to work, so we can continue to attract and retain the people we need for the future. We will continue to: ›Attract and retain capable, motivated people who represent the communities we serve. ›Develop a clear recruitment, development, and workforce planning approach. ›Grow our leadership capability. ›Provide opportunities for our people to develop. ›Embed capability-based roles and networked ways of working. Maximising the benefits of being digitally enabled Most digital interactions with the tax system are now handled by third party software and cross government information sharing . We’ll build further on this by working more closely with third parties to design and deliver digital solutions that support customer compliance and reduce effort for them. We’ll focus on further building our digital capabilities to support compliance by: ›Ensuring our people know how to use the digital tools we already have. ›Investing in digital solutions that deliver greater value. ›Ensuring our digital systems remain secure and stable and responsive to changing demands. Get ting the most value from the dat a we hold The data and information we hold and the infrastructure to support it is a key asset for government. We have strong foundations in place to protect its integrity. We aim to: ›Make the best use of the data held in our core system. ›A utomate or remove low or no value work or provide customers with self-service options. ›Ensure the data assets we create deliver what is needed and do not require significant effort from us, customers, or third parties. ›Consider how best to make the data we hold available to deliver on broader government outcomes. ›Maintain relevant government standards. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 16 Adding more value by work ing collaboratively wit h partners Partnerships are integral to how we operate. Delivering more integrated services for customers will reduce the cost of delivery for everyone in the system by: › Bei ng cle ar about where we can add value to the wider system. › Taking opportunities to leverage our tools and processes. › Continuing to build and maintain relationships with third parties including other agencies, iwi, intermediaries, and partners. Being an active steward Stewardship includes ensuring the legislation and products we administer, the systems, processes, and assets we are responsible for, and the capabilities of our people are fit-for -purpose now and in the future. Our stewardship work falls into three main areas— product and regulatory stewardship, policy stewardship and organisational stewardship. We will: › Ensure we have adequate resources and clear accountabilities for stewardship work. › Build our stewardship capability in relevant roles. › Invest in our systems and processes to keep pace with changes in our environment. Improving how we work internally To support our work in these areas, we’ll continue to improve our planning processes and how we deliver changes to ensure that our resources and funding are focused on the areas that will support Government priorities and improve compliance. W herever possible, we’ll reuse capabilities we already have, rather than creating bespoke solutions. We’ll also work to continuously improve how we deliver our day-to-day services to ensure we’re delivering the most value for New Zealanders. We consider our areas of strength to be: › Delivering services based on core information - particularly customer income data. › Collection and payment of money / processing at scale. › High-volume, digital transaction processing (rather than services that rely on high levels of discretion and/or an extensive customer-facing presence). › Delivering large-scale, consistent, rules-based initiatives that leverage the capabilities of our systems. › Analytical tools and capability, including risk assessment. › Developing and managing a sophisticated partner ecosystem with the private sector. Inland Revenue Statement of Intent November 2024–November 2028 17 Monitoring and responding to changes in our environment We continuously monitor future trends and how these might impact on us and our customers and their ability and willingness to comply. The changes we see as most relevant over the period of this Statement of Intent are: ›Societies in flux - We’ll continue to engage with customers in the face of increasing mis- and dis- information. High levels of trust help to ensure policy/legislative changes can be more easily implemented and support voluntary compliance. ›Population growth and demographic transition – As the New Zealand population ages, the tax base will reduce unless it can be replaced or increased in other ways. At the same time, tax revenue will be required to support increased investment in healthcare and to pay for superannuation. We’ll continue to work with The Treasury Te Tai Ōhanga to ensure the ongoing viability of the tax base. We’ll also need to consider how we attract and retain workers and ensure we cater to the needs of a changing population. ›Climate and environmental change – There may come a point where the tax system more comprehensively aims to change behaviour. This may alter our capability needs. We already have a role dealing with adverse events and this support may be required at a different scale in the future. ›Geopolitical volatility and instability – New Zealand relies heavily on a rules-based international order to create and implement multi- lateral agreements to address tax issues that require international co-operation. The number of tax issues requiring international cooperation is increasing. If multi-lateral cooperation diminishes, multi-lateral agreements will take longer and be harder to obtain leaving New Zealand with limited options for addressing non-compliance and emerging tax issues. ›Disruptive use of technology – It could be more challenging to maintain compliance in a world where complex and borderless transactions and reduced use of intermediaries make it more difficult to attribute transactions and income to customers. Increased challenges around cyber- security, privacy and ethics may require global co- operation. Understanding the implications of these changes will help us to better prepare for and respond to future government priorities and changes in customers’ behaviour.

Statement by the Ministers of Finance and Revenue
=================================================

**STATEMENT BY**

**Minister of Finance, Hon R O Douglas  
Minister of Revenue, Hon T A de Cleene**

### Introduction

This document is the final report of the Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform. It contains the recommendations of the Committee on the further detailed measures required for the operation of the imputation and international tax regimes. The draft legislation for these regimes is set out in a separate annex to the Committee's report.

As noted by Mr Valabh in his covering letter, the report involves a number of changes to the regimes developed by the Committee and presented in its first reports but nothing which could be described as fundamental. These changes reflect the detail required to implement the regimes in accordance with the structure and principles already approved.

The Government supports the Committee's recommendations subject to some minor changes and reservations on definitional matters as highlighted further below. An enormous amount of detail has had to be developed in a relatively short space of time. We concur with the Committee that the overall regime is now at a sufficiently advanced stage for the legislation to be circulated. After being introduced to the House, the Bill will be referred to a Select Committee. There will then be a final opportunity for submissions.

### Imputation

The Government endorsed the Committee's recommendations on imputation set out in its earlier report. There were relatively few issues that required further work. The Committee now makes additional recommendations on the rules governing the allocation of imputation credits, the inclusion of co-operative companies and producer boards within the imputation regime, the treatment of returns of capital, the carry forward of unutilised imputation credits, the operation of the dividend withholding payment system, and on consequential changes to the definition of a dividend and to the excess retention tax and deemed dividend provisions. All these recommendations are supported subject to the following changes.

First, the Committee recommends that distributions subject to the winding up distribution tax of 10 percent should not also be subject to non-resident withholding tax. It had been envisaged that the winding up distribution tax would be enacted along with the imputation and international tax reforms later in the year. The Government considers that it would instead be preferable to enact this measure as soon as possible to facilitate the winding up process. Accordingly, the Government has decided that the measure will be enacted through the Taxation Reform (No.4) Bill.

Secondly, the Committee has recommended that fringe benefits received by a major shareholder/employee be subject to the FBT regime rather than the current deemed dividend provisions, in respect of fringe benefits other than loans with effect from 1 April 1988, and in respect of loans with effect from 1 October 1988. The Government agrees with the extension of the FBT regime but has decided that the change apply to fringe benefits including loans with effect from 1 April 1988. It will give further consideration to the details of the change to take account of anti-avoidance rules which are being developed to strengthen the provisional tax regime. Consideration also needs to be given to the implications for companies which wind up before the legislation extending the FBT is passed.

In its earlier report the Committee recommended that the date for the first withholding payment by companies, in respect of foreign-source dividends received after 1 April 1988, be the 20th of the month following the month in which the necessary legislation is passed. Given the scheduled enactment of the legislation later this year, the Government has decided that, in order to provide greater certainty for taxpayers, the date for the first withholding payment will be 20 January 1989.

### International Tax

The international tax regime recommended by the Committee in its first report comprises a branch-equivalent (BE) regime, a foreign investment fund (FIF) regime, and a revised trust regime. The regimes are designed to reduce the myriad opportunities for residents to avoid or defer New Zealand tax where they interpose foreign entities between themselves and income-producing assets.

The legislation has been drafted to ensure that the three regimes support one another and other recent tax reform. The provisions are necessarily detailed and are supported by a number of anti-avoidance provisions. These should not be read down given the clear objective of the reforms. The purpose of the BE regime is to tax on a current basis New Zealand residents having economic or financial interests, including contingent interests, in the income of any foreign company where five or fewer residents in any manner whatsoever have a 50 percent or more interest in the company. The purpose of the FIF regime is also to tax residents on a current basis where they have interests in, but do not control, foreign entities in which they are able to accumulate income and obtain taxation advantages. Such interests include policies with foreign life offices and superannuation funds. The revised trust regime supports the BE and FIF regimes by generally taxing on a current basis the foreign-source trustee income of trusts having a New Zealand settlor, and taxing to New Zealand resident beneficiaries distributions from non-resident trustees.

We highlight the following features:

#### –    Aspects of BE Regime

Two important aspects here include the measurement of interests and an additional transitional measure. The Committee originally considered that a resident's control and income interests be measured on each day of the foreign company's accounting year. After further consideration, in light of the high compliance costs of daily measurement, the Committee now recommends that a resident's control and income interests be measured at the end of each quarter in a year and that anti-avoidance measures be adopted. In our view, this line strikes the right balance between minimising compliance costs and countering avoidance.

The Committee recommends that in respect of existing investments taxpayers should have the option of applying the BE regime before the end of the transitional period so that losses during that period may be accounted for in determining future BE income. In exercising this option, however, taxpayers cannot bring in losses and not profits. Accordingly, taxpayers will be entitled to elect, in respect of all of their income interests held on 17 December 1987 in all CFCs resident in countries not on the transitional list, to apply the BE regime for the accounting years of such CFCs falling in whole or in part during the period 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1990.

The Government has also decided the composition of, and the nature of the qualifications to, the permanent and transitional country lists as discussed below.

#### –    Grey List

The costs of complying with the BE regime should not exceed the revenue to be gained. For this reason, taxpayers with interests in CFCs resident in certain listed countries will not be subject to the regime. However, if stated preferences are utilised the BE regime will apply and income will be computed on a simplified basis. This list of countries is called a grey list.

Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America will be on the grey list (see Attachment A). The relevant considerations in deciding the list included: the definition of taxable income, the extent of any tax preferences, the level of income tax rates, the efficiency of tax administration, and the extent of protection of the domestic tax base (including a comprehensive international tax regime) in each country.

It might be argued in certain circumstances that a taxpayer with an interest in a CFC in a grey-list country will be treated more favourably than a taxpayer with a similar interest in a non-listed country. However, favourable treatment in this context means only that some taxpayers are freed from additional income calculations; it does not necessarily mean that there is any anomaly in terms of tax liability. Rather than make all taxpayers calculate their BE income, it is preferable to relieve at least some from compliance costs where there is little risk to revenue.

#### –    Qualification of Grey List

The general qualification to the grey list relates to business income derived by a CFC from outside the listed country in which it is resident which is not subject to tax in that country. Other forms of income such as interest and dividends are also being considered for qualification. A general qualification rather than a qualification by country is favoured at this stage. Should it be necessary to introduce country qualifications they will have prospective effect.

#### –    Transitional List of Low Tax Countries

Under the transition recommended by the Committee, residents with interests acquired on or before 17 December 1987 in companies resident in countries other than low tax jurisdictions will be exempt from the BE regime until 31 March 1990. The list of low tax jurisdictions for this purpose is contained in Attachment B. The list is an updated and more detailed version of the illustrative list set out in the Committee's earlier report.

#### –    Trusts

The Committee has recommended changes to the trust regime set out in Part 1 of its report but these are of detail rather than of principle. The Committee continues to hold to the following principles:

*   the taxation of foreign-source trustee income (ie income which is not taxed as beneficiary income) should be determined by the residence of the settlor, rather than by the residence of a trustee as is currently the case;
*   where there is a resident settlor of a trust in the year in which the trustee of the trust derives foreign-source trustee income, the liability for New Zealand tax on that income should rest in the first instance with the trustee (whether that trustee is a resident or a non-resident) and if the trustee does not meet the liability and is not resident in New Zealand, the liability should fall to the resident settlor.

Transitional provisions apply where a resident settled a trust on or before 17 December 1987.

In addition, the Government has decided that testamentary or inter vivos trusts settled by a person who dies a resident of New Zealand, should also be subject to New Zealand tax on their foreign-source income where such trusts have a. resident trustee. Although in these cases there is no resident settlor in the year trustee income is derived, the resident trustee provides a sufficient basis for taxation.

With respect to the recommended taxation of distributions from trusts, effective from 1 April 1988, the Government has decided to modify the treatment recommended by the Committee for foreign trusts (trusts which at no time since 17 December 1987 have had a settlor who is a New Zealand resident). As recommended, distributions from the trustee income of such trusts derived in income years commencing after 1 April 1987, other than of corpus and capital profits, would be assessable to a beneficiary at his or her marginal tax rate but other distributions from such trusts would be non-assessable. The Government has decided that distributions of trustee income of such trusts derived in income years commencing on or before 1 April 1987 should also be assessable to a beneficiary but at a flat rate of 10 percent. This treatment is consistent with the transitional provisions recommended by the Committee in respect of trusts settled before 17 December 1987 which are either wound up by 31 March 1989 or brought within the new settlor regime for the 1989 income year.

Under the new trust regime recommended by the Committee, the existing distinction between specified and non-specified trusts will be removed with effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1988 (the distinction was originally made to limit the scope for income splitting). Along with this change, the Committee has recommended a widened definition of beneficiary income to include income of a trust which vests in a beneficiary, as well as income paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary within six months of the end of a trustee's income year. The Government wishes to consider further the definition of beneficiary income.

#### –    Residence Rules

The definitions of residence under the Income Tax Act will be amended in order to reduce the scope for individuals and companies to manipulate their affairs to obtain taxation advantages. The new definitions, building on existing concepts, make it easier for a person to become a resident of New Zealand and harder to become a non-resident, and they more precisely define residence for companies.

In brief, if a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand or is present here for at least 183 days in any year he or she is resident, only ceasing to be so if absent for at least 325 days in any year having during that time no permanent place of abode here. A company will be resident in New Zealand if it is incorporated here or has its head office or its centre of director control or executive management here. There will be no special rule for banking companies.

#### –    Other Legislative Changes

To support the regime recommended by the Committee, two other legislative changes are required. These will be made through the Taxation Reform (No.4) Bill.

The first change is to the low income earner rebate. Despite the substantial reduction in the incentives for income splitting as a result of the flattening of the income tax scale, the Government is concerned to reduce them even further. Accordingly, it has decided to include beneficiary income in income which does not qualify for the low income earner rebate.

The second change relates to the rate of taxation of trustee income. The Committee has recommended a complete upgrading of the taxation of trusts including the removal of the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts from 1 April 1988. The uniform treatment of trustee income is an integral part of the trust regime and hence of the overall international regime since the BE, trust, and FIF regimes are mutually interlocking.

Accordingly, the trustee income of all trusts will be taxed at a rate of 35 percent or at the marginal composite rate scale for individuals (whichever is the higher) in the current year. From the 1989 income year, trustee income will be taxed at the top marginal rate for individuals (33 percent in that year).

This change will mean that some trustee income will be subject to a higher rate of tax than it would otherwise have been in the current year. This move towards a more uniform taxation of trustee income has been foreshadowed both in terms of the rates as originally set out in the No.4 Bill and the Government's acceptance of the Committee's earlier recommendations on the reform of the taxation of trusts.

#### –    Earlier Reservations

There were three issues on which Government expressed reservations in response to the Committee's first report on international tax reform:

a    the exclusion from the fund regime of the interests of residents in active businesses in low tax countries;

b    the treatment of capital profits from certain trusts; and

c    the transitional provisions in respect of trusts settled by residents before 17 December 1987.

The Government maintains its reservation in (a) and will be closely monitoring the FIF regime and strengthening it if necessary. As mentioned below, the reservations in (b) and (c) are removed in the light of changes to the Committee's recommendations on trusts.

The Committee recommends that where a trust settled on or before 17 December 1987 does not wind up before 1 April 1988 or the settlor, trustee or a beneficiary does not pay a tax of 10 percent on the net assets of the trust at 31 March 1988, distributions from the trust would be treated as non-qualifying distributions. This means that all such distributions (other than of corpus) would be taxable to beneficiaries at a tax rate of 45 percent. The Government considers that this measure provides a sufficient incentive for settlors in a position to do so to wind up such trusts or subject their foreign-source trustee income to tax in New Zealand.

Under the non-qualifying distribution provisions, distributions of capital profits would be taxed to a beneficiary. Distributions of capital profits which are not non-qualifying distributions would be non-assessable. Capital profits would of course, in some cases, continue to be taxable as trustee or beneficiary income. Capital profits of trusts that are foreign investment funds would also be taxable to residents. The recommended taxation of distributions of capital profits from trusts is broadly in line with existing treatment. However, it will need to be reviewed in considering the introduction of a capital gains tax.

### Conclusion

The Government supports the recommendations of the Consultative Committee subject to some relatively minor changes and reservations. The changes, as discussed, relate to:

*   the timing of the implementation of the winding up tax on distributions;
*   the timing of the extension of the fringe benefit regime to major shareholders/employees for concessionary loans;
*   the taxation of the foreign-source trustee income of certain trusts which have a resident trustee but no resident settlor; and
*   the taxation of certain distributions from foreign trusts.

As discussed, the only points on which the Government reserves its position at this stage concern:

*   the definition of a foreign investment fund. The Government maintains its earlier reservation and will strengthen the fund regime if necessary;
*   the need for anti-avoidance rules to support the extension of the fringe benefit tax; and
*   the definition of beneficiary income under the new trust regime.

The Government has also decided that in order to provide greater certainty for taxpayers the date for the first withholding payment by companies, in respect of foreign-source dividends received after 1 April 1988, will be 20 January 1989.

In addition to the legislation to implement the measures recommended by the Committee, two other consequential legislative changes are required. One is the addition of beneficiary income to the list of income which does not qualify for the low income earner rebate. This is designed to counter income splitting. The other change required is the rationalisation of the rate of taxation of trustee income. This is necessary given the removal of the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts under the new trust regime. These changes together with the distribution winding up tax will be implemented through the Taxation Reform (No.4) Bill.

The Government has decided the composition of, and the nature of the qualifications to, the permanent and transitional country lists for the purposes of the BE regime. The lists are set out in Attachments A and B to this statement.

Once again we record our thanks to the Committee. It is to be commended for its report and for its professional commitment to seeing through an extremely difficult job. Chaired by Mr Arthur Valabh, the Committee comprises Dr Robin Congreve, Mr Stuart Hutchinson, Dr Susan Lojkine, Professor John Prebble and Mr Tim Robinson.

After being introduced to the House, the Bill giving effect to the imputation and international tax reforms will be referred to a Select Committee. There will then be a final opportunity for submissions. We commend a close examination of the Committee's report and the draft legislation to all interested parties.

Japan;

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland;

United States of America, but excluding its possessions and territories.

**Notes**

1.  The Government has considered the Consultative Committee's recommendations concerning the listing of preferences and has decided that initially it would be more appropriate to list general features of tax systems which might be used to avoid the BE regime rather than listing specific preferences in relation to individual countries listed above. However, the Government intends to monitor developments in the seven listed countries. Once it is decided to list a particular preference or feature, or amend a listing, the change will apply prospectively.
2.  The legislation presented to Parliament will include one general qualification which will apply to all of the above listed countries. Interests in a CFC resident in a listed country will be subject to the BE regime where a CFC derives certain forms of foreign source income which are not subject to income tax in the listed country of residence. At this stage, it has been decided that the general qualification will apply to foreign source "business" income. Other forms of foreign source income, such as interest and dividends, are being considered for inclusion in this general qualification too.

Ngā tatauranga o ngā whakaea pūtea taurewa ākonga Statistics on student loan repayments
=======================================================================================

All data can be found in an Excel download located on the student loan dataset page. Data is updated two months post the end of each quarter.

[Datasets for student loan statistics](/about-us/tax-statistics/statistics-on-the-student-loan-scheme/datasets-for-student-loan-statistics)

Repayment thresholds for New Zealand-based borrowers
----------------------------------------------------

New Zealand-based borrowers receiving salary or wages are required to repay 12 cents of every dollar earned over the pay period repayment threshold (For example $464 per week from 1 April 2024). The deductions are considered sufficient and do not result in additional repayments provided they are within a determined threshold. If significant under-deductions occur, the employer is required to make compulsory extra deductions. Past threshold amounts are in the student loan quarterly download above.

Borrowers who earn $500 or more of adjusted net income (income that's not salary and wages and adjustments), and whose total income including salary or wages is $500 or more than the annual repayment threshold, are required to make payments on this income.

Additional information on adjusted net income can be found on our Repaying my student loan when I am self-employed or earn other income page.

Student loan repayments
-----------------------

This graph shows the amount of loan repayments from employers, New Zealand-based borrowers and overseas-based borrowers as at the end of each quarter from September 2013 to September 2024.

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/graphics/about-us/tax-statistics/student-loan/repayments/student-loan-repayments-by-quarter-q1.png?modified=20241215235025)   

As at 30 September 2024:

*   Repayments received directly from New Zealand-based student loan borrowers decreased 2.4% from $50.3 million in September 2023 to $49.1 million in September 2024.
*   Repayments from overseas-based student loan borrowers increased 48.5% from $40.6 million in September 2023 to $60.3 million in September 2024. 
*   Repayments through employer deductions decreased 9.8% from $307.1 million in September 2023 to $276.9 million in September 2024.
*   Total repayments for all borrowers decreased 3.0% from $398.0 million in September 2023 to $386.2 million in September 2024. 

Notes:

*   The amount repaid includes all money received:
*   directly from borrowers (voluntary payments, payments from borrowers with income other than salary and wages and overseas-based borrowers)
*   from employers through deductions from salary or wage earners.
*   The way student loan salary and wage repayment obligations were calculated changed on 1 April 2012, so each payment was considered full and final except if there were significant over or under deductions. The final "square up" payment under the previous regime was February 2013.
*   A borrower is any person who has drawn from the Student Loan Scheme and not yet repaid in full.

Percent of student loan borrowers that meet their obligations
-------------------------------------------------------------

This table shows the percent of student loan borrowers who have met their obligations against Inland Revenue’s performance target of 85%, as at the end of each quarter

| Overseas-based borrowers | 29.7% | 21.2% |
| **Total** | **83.9%** | **81.5%** |

As at 30 September 2024:

*   New Zealand-based borrowers meeting their obligations remained the same at 95.0% in September 2023 to September 2024.
*   Overseas-based borrowers meeting their obligations decreased by 8.5% from 29.7% in September 2023 to 21.2% in September 2024. 
*   All borrowers meeting their obligations decreased by 2.4% from 83.9% in September 2023 to 81.5% in September 2024 (against Inland Revenue’s performance target of 85%).

Notes:

*   To be considered compliant borrowers must have met their repayment obligations. For borrowers who do not have payments made through their employers, they will meet their obligations if they pay their assessment by the due date. For borrowers who have repayments through their employers, each payment is considered full and final unless their payment resulted in a significant over or under deduction.
*   A borrower is any person who has drawn from the Student Loan Scheme and not yet repaid in full.

Status of Commissioner's advice

[Commissioner's statements](/publications#f-ttTypeFacet=Commissioner's%20statements&sort=%40irscttissuedatetime%20descending&numberOfResults=25)

Issued

16 Nov 2012

Status of Commissioner's advice
===============================

This item sets out the status of advice (other than binding rulings) given by the Commissioner.

Some of the subject-matter of this item was covered by _"Amendment and re-opening of assessments: Policy statement by Commissioner of Inland Revenue"_ Public Information Bulletin No 123 (January 1984).  Much of that item is now redundant, having been overtaken, for example, by the Standard Practice Statement on s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 “_SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments_” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016).  Any remaining parts of the item that were still relevant are superseded by this current item.

This item may overlap with _"Remission of penalties and interest - SPS 05/10"_ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005), insofar as that item deals with remission where Inland Revenue has given incorrect advice to a taxpayer.  New legislation provides that no interest will be charged where a taxpayer relies on a "Commissioner’s official opinion".  However, _SPS 05/10_ still applies to a variety of circumstances where it is possible to obtain remission not covered by the new legislation.

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 24 No 10 December 2012](/tib/volume-24---2012/tib-vol24-no10)

* * *

All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated.

Introduction
============

1.  From time to time, the Commissioner provides advice to taxpayers to help them to comply with the tax laws. This advice is provided in different contexts and to different audiences (eg, advice to specific taxpayers and advice to the wider public).
2.  This item clarifies some issues in relation to advice the Commissioner gives. In particular, it considers:
    *   the legal status of the Commissioner’s advice and when the Commissioner will be bound by statements made
    *   taxpayers' liability for substantive tax, penalties and use of money interest where the Commissioner's advice is incorrect
    *   application dates for public statements
    *   the Commissioner's position in relation to court and tribunal decisions that the Commissioner believes do not accurately reflect the law, and
    *   the status of Standard Practice Statements the Commissioner issues.

Status of the Commissioner's advice
===================================

3.  Taxation laws are made by Parliament, not the Commissioner, or Inland Revenue. It is acknowledged that, as a matter of principle and good tax administration, taxpayers should generally be able to rely on advice the Commissioner gives. However, the Commissioner is under an obligation to apply the law correctly. With the exception of the binding rulings regime, the law is not changed merely by the Commissioner giving a different view (whether published or otherwise).
4.  The binding rulings regime was enacted in 1995 to help taxpayers achieve certainty in relation to their tax affairs through public rulings and taxpayer specific private and product rulings. Where a binding ruling has been issued that applies to a taxpayer, that taxpayer, by following the binding ruling, can be certain about how the Commissioner will apply the law (an application for a private ruling must disclose all relevant facts and documents relating to the arrangement for which the ruling is sought).
5.  By contrast, as a matter of practice, Inland Revenue will generally follow public statements. However, the Commissioner is not strictly bound by such statements or other advice unless they are binding rulings that apply to the particular taxpayer and arrangement: _CIR v Ti Toki Cabarets (1989) Ltd_ (2000) 19 NZTC 15,874, _Lemmington Holdings Ltd (No 2) v CIR_ (1983) 6 NZTC 61,576 and _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694. This statement outlines the Commissioner’s approach to advice that is not binding on the Commissioner.

Incorrect advice - liability for substantive tax
================================================

6.  From time to time the Commissioner will take the view that advice that has previously been given is incorrect. This may occur when:
    *   a court decision clarifies the law, which shows that the earlier advice is incorrect
    *   the Commissioner discovers an error in the earlier advice, or
    *   the Commissioner reconsiders the earlier advice and takes a different view.
7.  This raises issues about the liability of taxpayers who have returned their tax based on the advice given.
8.  Where the Commissioner has given incorrect advice (other than a binding ruling), this does not operate so as to change the tax legally payable on the basis of the correct application of the law. This is because the Commissioner cannot simply choose to alter the statutory basis of assessment: s 6A, _Vestey v IRC_ (1979) 3 All ER 976 and _R v IRC, ex p Wilkinson_ \[2005\] BTC 281. Any assessments previously made on the basis of that incorrect advice are, therefore, incorrect and can potentially be corrected by the Commissioner.
9.  The question that arises is whether the Commissioner will amend the assessment to correct it. This statement now considers different situations where this can arise.

Formal settlements and time barred assessment
---------------------------------------------

10.  Where a taxpayer has entered into a formal settlement with the Commissioner, this settlement will not be reversed.
11.  Similarly, if the statutory time bar applies to the original assessment, the Commissioner cannot amend that assessment.

Published public statements
---------------------------

12.  The following paragraphs apply to situations where the Commissioner's view of the law changes from what has been outlined in a published public statement that is still authoritative (that is, not outside any applicable application date and not overtaken by legislation or a later public statement).
13.  Published public statements are statements that Inland Revenue produces in hardcopy and/or on Inland Revenue's website. These include formal statements such as interpretation statements, interpretation guidelines, and Questions We've Been Asked as well as other publications such as Inland Revenue guides, Agents Answers and Business Tax Updates. Published public statements apply to all taxpayers that come within their terms.

### _**Where a new position is more favourable for taxpayers**_

14.  In cases where the change in view in a published public statement creates a more favourable position for taxpayers, the Commissioner will apply the principles set out in the Standard Practice Statement on s 113 on a case by case basis to determine whether to amend past assessments. These are currently set out in “_SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments_” Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016) (the SPS). Some of the relevant considerations include:
    *   whether a taxpayer has made an error as a result of relying on advice given by an Inland Revenue officer
    *   whether the taxpayer has provided all relevant information with their amendment request
    *   the length of time since the incorrect position was taken
    *   whether the resources required to make the amendment would be disproportionate to the amount of tax at stake, and
    *   any other relevant care and management considerations.
15.  However, in any case, all of the relevant considerations referred to in the SPS must be weighed. For the purposes of applying the SPS, following an incorrect position set out in a published statement of the Commissioner will be treated as a genuine error rather than a "regretted choice" (see paragraph 15 of the SPS).

### _**Where a new position is less favourable for taxpayers**_

16.  Where the change in view taken in a published public statement creates a less favourable position for taxpayers, the Commissioner will generally apply the new position prospectively from a stated date or income year or assessment period (as most appropriate).
17.  However, in exceptional cases, prospective application will not be appropriate, and immediate or retrospective application will be necessary or desirable (subject to the operation of the time bar). In deciding whether to use s 113 to apply a new position retrospectively, the Commissioner will apply the care and management principles in sections 6 and 6A. Factors the Commissioner will consider include (but are not limited to):
    *   the amount of revenue at stake
    *   the number of taxpayers affected - including the extent to which some taxpayers have been following the earlier incorrect position while others were taking the correct position
    *   the resources necessary to identify, audit and reassess the relevant taxpayers
    *   whether retrospective application is likely to undermine or support the integrity of the tax system, and
    *   whether retrospective application is likely to promote or adversely affect taxpayer compliance.
18.  For more details on the Commissioner’s interpretation of care and management principles, see "IS 10/07: Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts - Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994" _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010).

Taxpayer specific advice
------------------------

19.  The following paragraphs apply to situations where the Commissioner has a different view of the law than was previously communicated to a particular taxpayer in specific advice to them (other than in a binding ruling).

### _**Where a new position is more favourable for the taxpayer**_

20.  Where taxpayer-specific advice replaces earlier advice and creates a more favourable position for the taxpayer, the Commissioner will apply the principles set out in the Standard Practice Statement on s 113 on a case by case basis to determine whether past assessments will be amended to reflect the more favourable position. As noted above, some of the relevant considerations include:
    *   whether a taxpayer has made an error as a result of relying on advice given by an Inland Revenue officer
    *   whether the taxpayer has provided all relevant information with their amendment request
    *   the length of time since the incorrect position was taken
    *   whether the resources required to make the amendment would be disproportionate to the amount of tax at stake, and
    *   any other relevant care and management considerations.
21.  However, in any case, all of the relevant considerations referred to in the SPS must be weighed. For the purposes of applying the SPS, following specific incorrect advice given by the Commissioner will be treated as a genuine error rather than a "regretted choice" (see paragraph 15 of the SPS).

### _**Where a new position is less favourable for the taxpayer**_

22.  Where taxpayer specific advice replaces earlier advice and creates a less favourable position for the taxpayer, the Commissioner will apply the principles in the care and management interpretation statement to determine whether to apply s 113 to amend the assessment of a taxpayer who has relied on that earlier advice (other than in a binding ruling). This will involve considering factors such as those set out above in relation to published public advice. In the case of advice given to a specific taxpayer these factors are generally more likely to support an amended assessment than in the case of reliance on incorrect published public advice.

Application dates for public statements
---------------------------------------

23.  The Commissioner acknowledges that it is desirable for taxpayers to have certainty around when changes in view will be applied from. This is particularly the case when changes in view are unfavourable to taxpayers.
24.  Where an incorrect public statement is replaced by a new published public statement that is less favourable to taxpayers, the new statement will explicitly state the date from which it will apply or, in exceptional cases, that it applies to prior periods.
25.  An application date will also be provided where a published public statement represents a change in the Commissioner’s official position that is less favourable to taxpayers even if the previous position was not set out in a published public statement.
26.  If there is no existing position an application date will not generally be necessary. However, an application date may be stated if it is thought this will assist taxpayers.

Commissioner’s official opinions - liability for interest and shortfall penalties
=================================================================================

27.  The previous part of this statement considered the position in relation to taxpayers' liability for substantive tax where the Commissioner changes a previously communicated view. The next part of the statement considers taxpayers' liability for interest and shortfall penalties where the Commissioner has given a "Commissioner's official opinion". Section 120W provides that for "Commissioner’s official opinions" given on or after 7 September 2010:
    *   A taxpayer that, but for this section, is liable to pay interest on unpaid tax to the Commissioner, is not liable to pay that interest to the extent to which it arises because they relied on a Commissioner's official opinion.For Commissioner’s official opinions that are in writing, the opinion will be "given" on the date it is issued.
28.  Further, s 141B(1D) provides that:
    *   A taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position to the extent to which they have taken their position because they have relied on a Commissioner’s official opinion.
29.  This exclusion applies to shortfall penalties under sections 141A (not taking reasonable care), 141B (unacceptable tax position), 141C (gross carelessness) and 141D (abusive tax position). Sections 141A to 141D all effectively require taxpayers to have taken an "unacceptable tax position": sections 141A(3), 141B(2), 141C(4), 141D(4) and s 3 definition of "acceptable tax position".
30.  Therefore, to the extent that taxpayers take an incorrect tax position because they rely on a "Commissioner's official opinion", they will not be liable for interest on unpaid tax, or for a shortfall penalty under sections 141A, 141B, 141C and 141D. The term "Commissioner’s official opinion" is defined in s 3 as:
    *   (a) means, for a taxpayer,-
        *   (i) an opinion of the Commissioner concerning the tax affairs of the taxpayer, given by the Commissioner, either orally or in writing, after all information relevant to forming the opinion has been provided to the Commissioner, if that information is correct:
        *   (ii) a finalised official statement of the Commissioner, in writing, if it specifically applies to the taxpayer’s situation.
    *   (b) does not include a private binding ruling
31.  There are two types of "Commissioner’s official opinion" - taxpayer specific opinions and official statements. The first type is an opinion the Commissioner gives in relation to the tax affairs of a specific taxpayer. Therefore, only the taxpayer concerned may rely on the opinion. The opinion can be oral or written. However, the Commissioner must first have been provided with all information relevant to forming the opinion, and that information must be correct. Consequently, if the taxpayer has not provided all the information that is relevant to the Commissioner reaching a correct view (whether intentionally or otherwise), or not all of the relevant information is correct, then the view given will not be a "Commissioner’s official opinion".
32.  The second type of "Commissioner’s official opinion" is a finalised official statement of the Commissioner. These must be in writing and will be published by Inland Revenue, in hardcopy and/or on the Inland Revenue website. Examples include interpretation statements, interpretation guidelines, Questions We've Been Asked, Inland Revenue guides, Agents Answers and Business Tax Updates. An official statement must apply to a taxpayer’s situation specifically before a taxpayer is able to rely on that statement. These statements must also be finalised. Draft statements the Commissioner issues are not "Commissioner’s official opinions". However, the Commissioner will generally not impose shortfall penalties under sections 141A - 141D when taxpayers follow the position set out in a draft statement.
33.  Where advice given is not a "Commissioner's official opinion", then the provisions relating to interest and shortfall penalties will apply to taxpayers in the usual way (see also _"Remission of penalties and interest - SPS 05/10"_ Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9 (November 2005)).

Standard Practice Statements
----------------------------

34.  Standard Practice Statements are general guidelines the Commissioner issues. These statements describe how the Commissioner will usually exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner will usually apply positions set out in Standard Practice Statements. However, there may be times where it is appropriate for the Commissioner not to follow a position set out in a Standard Practice Statement for example, if it is necessary for the proper exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion in a particular fact situation. In this regard, as with all statements (except binding rulings) Standard Practice Statements are not binding on the Commissioner.
35.  Standard Practice Statements are, however, a "Commissioner’s official opinion". To the extent that taxpayers take a tax position in reliance on a Standard Practice Statement and that tax position is incorrect, sections 120W and 141B(1D) apply as discussed above.

Court or tribunal decisions
---------------------------

36.  Occasionally, a court or tribunal may make a decision that the Commissioner does not consider correctly reflects the law. The Commissioner may appeal the decision or seek to test the issue in a subsequent case. In such cases, because the Commissioner considers the decision in question does not reflect the law correctly, the approach taken by the Commissioner may not be modified to reflect the decision until its correctness has been established.
37.  Where this is the case, the Commissioner will advise taxpayers in a Tax Information Bulletin as soon as practicable of the position being taken and that taxpayers should not rely on Inland Revenue adoption of the decision in the interim. The Commissioner will generally not impose shortfall penalties under sections 141A - 141D when taxpayers follow the position taken in a current court decision.
38.  From time to time there will also be cases where a decision is confined to its own facts. In such cases the decision will not be precedential and may not be applied outside of the unique facts of the case. Where possible the Commissioner will set this out in a decision impact statement following the decision or subsequently advise taxpayers in a Tax Information Bulletin.

Statutory Interpretation: section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
=================================================================

2016 case note - Court found the words 'other revenues' in the Income Tax Act 2007 do not capture amounts that are capital in nature - statutory interpretation.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Vector Limited \[2016\] NZCA 396

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

The Court of Appeal has found that the words "other revenues" in s CC 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 ("the Act") do not capture amounts that are capital in nature.

### Impact

The decision clarifies the law in relation to payments derived from the use of land. The Court of Appeal has indicated that some of the payments received in similar circumstances to this case will now be captured by s CC 1B of the Act.

### Facts

The respondent ("Vector Ltd") sold access rights to a tunnel for $50 million ("Southern Access Rights") and rights to its overhead corridor through which electricity is to be distributed for approximately $3 million ("Northern Access Rights") to the national grid operator, Transpower New Zealand Ltd ("Transpower"). The combined sum Transpower paid Vector was circa $53 million ("the Consideration").

Whether the Consideration was on capital or revenue account turned on whether it was deemed income under s CC 1 of the Act.

The High Court found that the Consideration was a non-taxable capital receipt (_Vector Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 2069, (2014) 26 NZTC 21-096). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") appealed that decision.

### Decision

The Commissioner's appeal was dismissed on all grounds. The Court found that the High Court was correct in its analysis of the nature of the legal rights and responsibilities under the June 2010 agreement between Vector and Transpower. The Court dealt with Issues 1 (Whether the text of s CC 1 and its context in the scheme of the Act establish that the purpose of the section is to include in a taxpayer's income amounts "derived … from" the use of "land" that it "owns") and 2 (Whether the High Court erred in its interpretation of the term "other revenues" in s CC 1(2)(g), namely that it does not include amounts of a capital nature) together and Issue 3 (Whether the High Court erred in its analysis of the nature of the legal rights and responsibilities retained and/or given away by the agreement between Vector and Transpower) separately.

_Issues 1 & 2_

The Court concluded that there has never been a coherent, overarching scheme in s CC 1 (that the amounts derived by a landowner for letting another use its land is taxable). The Court finally noted that if Parliament had intended a scheme of the nature contended by the Commissioner, that is, capturing all amounts derived from specified uses of land short of disposal, it would have said so.

As for issue 2, the Court found that the lack of a coherent scheme or approach is evident from the listed amounts in s CC 1(2), noting that the listed amounts do not naturally fall into a group with common characteristics.

The Court made four points on this issue. In brief they are:

1.  The listed amounts in subs (2) have been specifically selected. Their inclusion in a list does not create a general remit to treat all proceeds from the use of land as income, regardless of their treatment on ordinary taxation principles. Parliament could have used simple and clear language to describe a class of this nature. The items are diverse in nature. No ejusdem generis class emerges.
2.  It is significant that Parliament chose, deliberately, the concluding words "other revenues" and not for instance, "other like amounts".
3.  The best approach is to focus on the words "other revenues" read in their natural sense. In context, the words "other revenues" are there to capture revenue receipts.
4.  The Commissioner's approach, that "other revenues" can include amounts that are on capital account, would effectively render subs (2) otiose as any "amount" derived as per subs (1) would be an "amount described in subsection (2)" however, that cannot have been intended.

The Court concluded that the High Court was correct in finding that the term "other revenues" used in s CC 1(2)(g) does not include amounts of a capital nature.

_Issue 3_

The Commissioner's alternative submission was that in reality the Consideration was disguised rent paid in advance as a lump sum.

In rejecting the Commissioner's submission the Court made the following points:

1.  In terms of the Northern Access Rights, there are permanent impairments on Vector's ability to use its assets.
2.  In terms of the Southern Access Rights, because the agreement between Vector and Transpower extended beyond the life expectancy of the tunnel, it was economically permanent.
3.  There is no ability for Vector to regain its interest for non-payment of the Consideration, because that Consideration has already been paid.

The Court concluded that there was effectively permanent disposition of property interests.

The appeal and cross-appeals were dismissed.

Strike-out application dismissed
================================

2014 case note - decision confirmed the statutory process to challenge the correctness of assessments, and the statutory role of the TRA - stay, damages.

Case

TRA 02/12; 2014 NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") rejected the disputants' application to strike out or stay the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") defence to their challenge.

### Impact of decision

The TRA in this decision confirmed the statutory process to challenge the correctness of assessments is as set out in section 138B and Part 8A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") as well as confirming the statutory role of the TRA.

### Facts

Mr C and his family controlled the disputant companies, which are in the business of producing and publishing DVDs. The disputants are part of a group of separate companies, the others being administration companies.

Each of the companies is registered for goods and services tax ("GST"). The disputants were involved in a dispute with the Commissioner concerning GST claims arising from a number of supplies made to the disputants by the administrative companies in the group. The disputants filed GST returns on a monthly invoice basis, while the administration companies filed on a six-monthly payment basis. The Commissioner considered the disputants were part of a tax avoidance arrangement under section 76 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act") involving mismatched inputs and output tax. She also disputed the value and content of the supplies between the administration companies and the disputants.

The disputants, having filed a Notice of Claim in January 2012 in the TRA challenging the Commissioner's decision, subsequently filed an application seeking the following orders:

1.  strike out the proceedings; or
2.  stay the proceedings; and
3.  award costs/damages, or
4.  alternatively if the proceedings are not struck out or stayed, that an order for the Notice of Proposed Adjustment to be reissued after proper investigation "where the applicants sit down with the disputant or a Special Conference Facilitation be carried out with a DVD player available Before the matter comes back to the TRA".

### Decision

#### _Striking out the proceedings_

The disputants argued that the Commissioner has disclosed no reasonable grounds or evidence to support any claim of tax avoidance under section 76 of the GST Act and accordingly, an order striking out the challenge proceedings should be made.

In making this argument, the disputants relied on rule 2.50 of the District Court Rules 2009 ("DCR") and submitted that this rule gives the widest discretion for a strike-out application. The disputants argued that although it was the disputants who had brought the claim, the disputant companies were in reality defending themselves against the Commissioner's assessments.

The Commissioner submitted that the strike-out application was misconceived as the effect of granting the application would be to strike out the disputants' own proceedings, which would leave the assessments as they stand with tax to be paid by the disputants.

The TRA referred to section 138B and Part 8A of the TAA, which outline the disputes process to be followed, noted that the process to challenge the correctness of the Commissioner's assessments had been followed by the disputants and that that procedure was set down by statute. Judge Sinclair held that the TRA could not possibly treat the disputants as the defendant and consider the application on that basis. Instead, Judge Sinclair found that the disputants were required to put their case to the TRA for determination at a substantive hearing.

The TRA considered whether the Commissioner's defence to the disputants' challenge could be struck out under rule 2.50.1 of the DCR. In that regard, Sinclair J referred to the case of _Attorney-General v Prince and Gardiner_ \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262 (CA) (endorsed by the Supreme Court in _Couch v Attorney-General_ \[2008\] NZSC 45, \[2008\] 3 NZLR 725), which sets out the established criteria for strike-outs, and held that this was not a case where the Commissioner's defence was clearly untenable. Again, the TRA considered that whether or not the assessments were correct was a question for the substantive hearing and not for a strike-out application.

#### _Stay of proceedings_

Judge Sinclair outlined rule 2.50.3 of the DCR which allows the Court to stay a proceeding if the Notice of Claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious, or is an abuse of the process of the court. Judge Sinclair went on to conclude that the grounds in rule 2.50.3 related to the disputants' claim and there was no allegation by the Commissioner that the Notice of Claim does not disclose a reasonable cause of action, that the proceeding is frivolous or vexatious or is an abuse of process. Accordingly, as the proceedings were brought by the disputants and not by the Commissioner, rule 2.50.3 did not apply in this case.

#### _Cost/damages_

The TRA held that the disputants' claims for costs and damages for wasted time and expenditure, abuse of process, breach of natural justice and breach of contract/estoppel were not available in its jurisdiction.

The TRA stated that it could only award costs in limited circumstances where the Commissioner failed to appear for a hearing or where the objection/challenge was vexatious. The TRA concluded that neither of those circumstances applied in this case.

In terms of the damages claimed, the TRA referred to section 138P of the TAA which sets out its powers on hearing a challenge to an assessment. Judge Sinclair held that the TRA did not have power to award damages and even if it had jurisdiction, the causes of action would have to be fully pleaded and proceeded by way of a substantive hearing with witnesses giving evidence and the evidence being tested under cross-examination, as appropriate.

#### _Reissue of the Notice of Proposed Adjustment_

The TRA, in considering the disputants' argument, outlined its statutory role under the TAA and Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 to hear and determine challenges to tax assessments. It held that its powers did not extend to directing the Commissioner to issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment or recommence the dispute process. Judge Sinclair found this alternative application of the disputants also to be misconceived.

The TRA dismissed the disputants' application in its entirety.

Case

TRA 030/15 \[2016\] NZTRA 06

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994: ss 14, 89AB, 89K and 138H

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") dismissed the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s ("the Commissioner") strike out application as service of the notices of assessment did not appear to be satisfactory and issues as to the disputant’s standing to bring proceedings needed to be canvassed.

### Impact

The decision highlights the necessity for the Commissioner to ensure compliance with s 14(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") when issuing notices of assessment by post.

### Facts

The Commissioner applied to strike out the disputant’s challenge proceedings on the basis that the claim had no reasonable cause of action as the disputant had not complied with the requirements of the disputes process. The disputant opposed the application and argued that there was no evidence of his assessments before the TRA.

On 17 February 2011, the disputant was adjudicated bankrupt following a previous investigation by the Commissioner. In 2013 the disputant was charged with, and subsequently pleaded guilty to, various offences of failing to file income tax returns with the intention of evading the assessment or payment of tax and tax evasion.

In December 2013, the Commissioner made a number of default assessments and subsequently issued notices of assessment to the disputant. Notices of assessment for the majority of the relevant periods/income years were sent to the Official Assignee at a Private Bag address in March 2014.

Further copies of the notices of assessments were issued to the disputant in March and April 2014. The disputant did not take any steps and consequently on 1 August 2014 the Commissioner wrote to the disputant advising that he was deemed to have accepted the assessments.

Judgment was subsequently entered against the disputant in June 2015 for the debt. On 25 September 2015 the disputant issued a notice of proposed adjustment ("NOPA") to the Commissioner. The disputant alleged that no notice of disputable decision had been issued and no assessments had been made. The Commissioner replied on 28 September 2015, repeating her advice that as the disputant had not supplied a NOPA and the requisite tax returns within the required period, the assessments were now deemed to be accepted.

On 2 October 2015 the disputant again corresponded with the Commissioner, attaching a further copy of his NOPA. The Commissioner responded on 29 October 2015, informing the disputant that the Commissioner had considered whether his late NOPA could be accepted however had determined that the requirements of s 89K of the TAA had not been met. The disputant subsequently issued challenge proceedings.

### **Decision**

Although acknowledging there were considerable difficulties with the disputant’s claim, the TRA was not prepared to grant the Commissioner’s application to strike out the proceeding.

The Commissioner had submitted that the disputant had not complied with the requirements of the disputes process in Part 4A of the TAA which precede the right to challenge under Part 8A. In particular, the Commissioner contended the disputant had failed to file a NOPA within the applicable response period; had not satisfied the requirements under s 89K; and had failed to file the outstanding returns as required by s 89D.

However, the TRA was not satisfied on the evidence before it that any of the notices of assessment were properly served on the Official Assignee in accordance with s 14(8) of the TAA as no evidence was provided to show the address was the current address for the Official Assignee and/or that the notices were addressed to the Official Assignee.

The Commissioner did concede that the notices of assessments for two GST periods were not sent to the Official Assignee and therefore the response period in s 89AB of the TAA had not been triggered and so any challenge under Part 8A of the TAA in respect of those assessments was premature.

The Commissioner also contended that the disputant had no standing to bring or continue the proceedings as the assessments related to property acquired by the disputant during the period of his bankruptcy as the property vested in the Official Assignee and the disputant's rights in it were extinguished.

The TRA noted that while the Commissioner made this submission, the Commissioner had still proceeded against the disputant in his personal capacity and obtained judgment against him in respect of the relevant assessments.

Case

Chesterfield Preschools Limited & Others v the Commissioner of Inland Revenue & Others

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Judicature Act 1908, High Court Rules

### Summary

The plaintiffs claimed that the Commissioner had failed to act on a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") they issued in response to a memorandum of decision issued to them by the Commissioner. The alleged NOPA was issued at a time when several other proceedings involving the same issues were being reviewed by the Courts. The Commissioner applied for strike out on the grounds of abuse of process and no reasonable cause of action. The strike-out application was dismissed.

### Impact of decision

The decision confirms that the grounds for strike out are limited.

### Facts

These proceedings relate to orders sought by the plaintiffs regarding decisions made by the Commissioner about an alleged NOPA filed by the plaintiffs. The Commissioner sought to have the claim struck out on the grounds that the claim was an abuse of process and that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action.

The plaintiffs alleged in an initial judicial review and related appeals that the Commissioner:

*   did not honour arrangements made with them about their tax liabilities;
*   had failed to act with reasonable diligence and celerity in progressing audits and processing GST returns;
*   had behaved unreasonably over the re-registration for GST of one of the plaintiffs' companies; and
*   acted unreasonably with regard to remission of penalties and by his attempts to recover tax debts from the plaintiffs.

The first judicial review judgment (_Chesterfields Preschools Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Christchurch CIV-2004-409-001596, 15 December 2006) found generally in favour of the plaintiffs. Fogarty J set aside a June 2004 decision by the Commissioner declining the remission of additional tax. He required the remission issue to be reconsidered and gave certain directions as to that reconsideration.

A second judicial review (_Chesterfields Preschools Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Christchurch CIV-2008-409-0722, 25 November 2008) relating to the first judicial review was also undertaken and the Commissioner was again directed to reconsider his actions with respect to the remission. The second judicial review was later appealed by the Commissioner (_Chesterfield Preschools Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2010\] NZCA 400; (2010) 24 NZTC 24,500). The second judicial review related to how the Commissioner had acted on the directions from the court in the first judicial review.

In June 2007 in response to the first judicial review, the Commissioner filed a memorandum of decisions which related to the plaintiffs' tax positions. The plaintiffs alleged they issued a NOPA to the Commissioner in response to the memorandum of the Commissioner. The Commissioner argues that no valid NOPA was served on him.

In October 2008, the plaintiffs commenced these "tax challenge" proceedings which the Commissioner applied to strike out.

The grounds of the strike-out application relied on by the Commissioner are summarised in the judgment at \[9\]:

1.  The present proceeding is in essence an invitation to the High Court to reopen either or both of the two judicial review proceedings, in relation to which the High Court is _functus officio._
2.  The plaintiffs are precluded from pursuing the present proceeding either because of issue estoppel or the doctrine of _res judicata_.
3.  The present proceeding is an attempt to circumvent the disputes and challenge proceedings in the Tax Administration Act 1994.
4.  The present proceeding involves "gaming and diversionary behaviour" in terms of the Court of Appeal's description in _Westpac Banking Corporation v CIR_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 99.

At \[16\] Associate Judge Osborne noted that the principles for strike-out set out in _Attorney General v Prince_ \[1998\] (_Attorney General v Prince_ \[1998\] 1 NZLR 262), which were applicable in this case, included the following:

1.  The Court is to assume that the facts as pleaded are true (unless they are entirely speculative and without foundation).
2.  The cause of action must be clearly untenable in the sense that the Court can be certain that it cannot succeed.
3.  The jurisdiction is to be exercised sparingly and only in clear cases.
4.  The jurisdiction is not excluded by the need to decide difficult questions of law, even if requiring extensive argument.
5.  The court should be slow to rule on novel categories of duty of care at the strike-out stage.

In \[23\], Associate Judge Osborne observed that the plaintiffs had pleaded that the plaintiffs'"… proposed adjustments in the NOPA were consistent with the findings and determination of the December 2006 judgment …"and "\[T\]he NOPA set out at paragraphs 33 to 37, the distinction between the disputable decisions that were addressed in the NOPA, and the discretionary decisions that were to be reviewed in judicial review proceedings …".

Associate Judge Osborne noted that the Commissioner continued to deny that the plaintiffs had met the statutory requirements for issuing a NOPA but that the main focus of the strike out proceedings was on _res judicata/_issue estoppel. The Court then discussed the issue of further litigation between the parties which had reference to the NOPA.

In a decision relating to the plaintiffs' property (_Chesterfield Preschools Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Christchurch CIV-2004-409-001597, 31 October 2007), Fogarty J recognised that alternatives existed to challenge the June 2007 decision, one of which was "to take the matter up internally by way of NOPA" \[27\].

In a decision relating to the first judicial review (_Chesterfields Preschools Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HCChristchurch CIV-2004-409-001596, 30 September 2009) Fogarty J:

*   observed there was a serious argument as to whether pursuing the NOPA would be an abuse of process but observed that, depending on the outcome of the Court of Appeal hearing, there may yet be some life in bringing the NOPA issue for hearing \[32\].

A further judgment of Fogarty J (_Chesterfield Preschools Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ HC Christchurch CIV 2004-409-001596, 21 October 2009) recorded that counsel for the Commissioner had:

*   … re-assured me by stating the obvious that if and when the validity of the NOPA become relevant, and if it is found to be relevant, and he thinks that would probably be by way of a Court decision, then appropriate orders can be made as to the process thereafter \[33\].

In the Court of Appeal judgment (_Chesterfield Preschools Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2010\] NZCA 400; (2010) 24NZTC 24,500) in relation to the second judicial review, the Commissioner submitted that some issues dealt with by Fogarty J should have been dealt with by way of statutory challenge procedures. The Court of Appeal discussed this and noted "We are not to be taken as making any comment on whether the purported challenge is valid or not …" \[36\].

### Decision

The Court found that it had been a recurring feature of the various branches of litigation between the parties that both have recognised the appropriateness of the statutory challenge procedures in relation to at least some of the issues. This was not a case where the parties had ignored, deliberately or inadvertently, the distinction between those matters properly to be determined through the statutory challenge procedures and the very limited category of matters that might be susceptible to judicial review. Both parties were aware of the distinction and incorporated it into various submissions on various applications.

Both the _sub judice_ and issue estoppel pleadings fell away subsequent to the Court of Appeal issuing its judgment on 31 August 2010. The Court of Appeal was not asked to rule on the validity or outcome of the NOPA and expressly recognised the possibility that the purported challenge of 2007 might yet be upheld.

The Court recognised that there was substantial room for the Commissioner to argue that at least some of the matters in the NOPA were not the proper subject matter of a NOPA but submissions to that effect are to be properly determined when the validity of the NOPA is before the Court in a substantive hearing. The appropriate course is for all of the issues relating to the NOPA to be before the Court at a substantive hearing.

This is not as clear a case as the authorities envisage for the exercise of the strike-out jurisdiction and given the history of these proceedings and repeated references to the appropriateness of statutory procedures, this was not a case where issue estoppel clearly arises.

The Commissioner's application for orders striking out the statement of claim was dismissed.

Associate Judge Osborne noted that if the plaintiffs (other than Mr Hampton) are to pursue this litigation further, they will be required to either enter appearances through a solicitor or will require leave to be represented by Mr Hampton and the granting of such leave is unlikely.

Structured finance taxpayer's appeal dismissed
==============================================

2009 case note - Taxpayer's appeal from High Court decision to strike out a cause of action dismissed - Judicial review, escalation regime.

Case

Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Sections 109 and 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

Taxpayer's appeal from High Court decision to strike out a cause of action dismissed.

### Impact of decision

A useful judgment discussing the role of judicial review in the tax context. The Court of Appeal favoured a narrow approach based upon the statutory provisions (considerable emphasis was placed upon sections 109 and 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)) and the need for truly exceptional circumstances before any judicial review would be allowed to continue (emphasis was placed upon par \[62-64\] quoted in below).

### Facts

This is part of the Structured Finance (SF) litigation.

It was an appeal from a decision of Harrison J (reported (2008) 23 NZTC 21,694).

The taxpayer entered into a number of international SF deals. The earliest of these deals ("First Data") was subject to a positive binding ruling and the taxpayer took the view that the subsequent deals conformed in all material senses with that ruling.

The Commissioner (primarily large Enterprises or Corporates as it then was) considered there were material factual differences and reassessed the subsequent deals relying upon section BG1. In reaching this decision the Commissioner's internal escalation process was not fully complied with.

The taxpayer sought to argue the validity of the assessments made, arguing the assessments were invalid for a number of reasons. The Commissioner sought to strike out the cause of action in the taxpayer's claim raising the validity issue arguing the claim could not succeed.

The Commissioner was successful at the High Court and the taxpayer appealed.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal dismissed the taxpayer's appeal.

In giving the judgment of the Court, William Palmer P noted that the basis upon which the validity point was advanced had changed since Justice Harrison's decision \[par 5\].

In the course of reviewing the background \[par 12-42\] it was noted that the Corporates Unit and the Adjudication Unit had differing views of the facts between the First Data ruling and the facts in the subsequent deals entered into \[par 27-30\]. It was also noted that the internal escalation process in this particular case was not observed consistently with the escalation memorandum \[par 31-38\].

The Court, before reviewing the development of judicial review in England, Australia and New Zealand, emphasised the role of sections 190 and 114 of the TAA describing these as providing "a particularly inauspicious statutory context for judicial review (ie outside of the challenge process provided for by the TAA)." \[at par 47\].

In reviewing the New Zealand position the Court recorded:

> \[53\] The New Zealand authorities support the proposition that it is open to a taxpayer to challenge what purports to be an assessment which in fact does not represent the genuine assessment of the Commissioner as to the tax position of the taxpayer, cf **Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd** \[1994\] 2 NZLR 681 (CA). Generally the Courts have accepted that the correctness of a tax assessment can only be challenged in challenge proceedings (see **Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Lemmington Holdings Ltd** \[1982\] 1 NZLR 517 (CA) and **Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue** \[1995\] 3 NZLR 664 (CA)) and that challenge by way of judicial review is reserved for exceptional cases, see **Miller v Commissioner of Inland Revenue** \[2001\] 3 NZLR 316 at \[18\] (PC). The cases are not particularly specific as to what circumstances are sufficiently exceptional as to warrant judicial review proceedings.

The Court also noted the existence of section 6A and the rulings regimes as being pointers in opposite directions with section 6A being "conducive" to a board approach to judicial review but the rulings regime being the opposite \[par 56\].

Thus the Court concluded that:

> \[59\] We think it appropriate to continue to apply the established principles as to judicial review in tax cases. We accept that judicial review is available where what purports to be an assessment is not an assessment. Associated with this, we accept that judicial review is available in exceptional cases and thus may be available in cases of conscious maladministration (as was recognised in **Futuris**). We can reconcile this with sections 109 and 114 on the basis that in such cases (ie no genuine assessment or conscious maladministration) what is challenged is either not an assessment, or at the least, not the sort of assessment which the legislature had in mind in enacting those sections. On this basis we see the availability of judicial review as depending on the claimant establishing exceptional circumstances of a kind which results in the amended assessment falling outside the scope of sections 109 and 114 and thereby not engaging those sections.

The Court found that a board approach to judicial review was inconsistent with section 109 and said:

> \[61\] We also consider that the broad approach contended for by Westpac places too much emphasis on the assessment as an exercise of a statutory power of decision. An assessment should reflect the correct tax position and a taxpayer's liability to pay tax exists independently of the assessment. If the assessment is correct, it is hard to see why complaints about process should result in the taxpayer not paying tax on a correct basis. Where there are very large sums of tax at stake (as there are here), this raises fairness considerations in relation to other taxpayers who have met their liabilities for the tax year concerned. If the assessment is wrong, it can be corrected in later challenge proceedings. If it is correct, the tax should be paid. It is frankly difficult to see what is unfair in this approach.
> 
> \[62\] Further, it is perfectly clear that allowing collateral challenge to assessments through judicial review can provide scope for gaming and diversionary behaviour. \[63\] In the past taxpayers going down the judicial review route have often sought to delay the statutory processes (whether prior to, or after, assessment) until the judicial review proceedings are completed; this on the ostensibly sensible ground that until the judicial review claim is determined it is premature to proceed with the statutory process. The response of the courts has been to require the review claim to be brought in the same proceedings as the challenge. But this is not necessarily an answer to the potential for judicial review to lead to delay, as illustrated by an unsuccessful attempt by Westpac in this case to have its validity cause of actions heard first.
> 
> \[64\] Collateral challenge involves not just delay but also diversion of effort and resources. The challenge proceedings between Westpac and the Commissioner will be complex and will fully engage the attention and resources of the Commissioner and the Court. The validity cause of action involves an attempt by Westpac to turn the case back onto the Commissioner. If it goes to trial, considerable resources which might otherwise have been devoted to the primary issue between the parties will be diverted to an inquiry into the internal processes of the Inland Revenue Department. This inquiry will throw up questions which are on the one hand difficult and nuanced (as to the subtleties of the differences of approach adopted by Rulings and Corporates) but on the other entirely irrelevant to whether Westpac owes the tax it has been assessed to pay which in the end will turn on the Judge's approach to section BG 1.

It was noted that the escalation regime is not statutory and that the Commissioner could depart from it depending upon the circumstances \[par 71\]. The Court then turned to the taxpayer's complaints and dismissed each in turn, applying the Court's view as articulated in the paragraphs quoted above and concluding there were no exceptional circumstances such as to justify judicial review (see for example \[par 74\]).

Returning to the escalation process and whether these gave raise to exceptional circumstances, it was said:

> \[94\] Although the escalation process and its resolution were causally connected to the amended assessment, we take the view that it would be inconsistent with the policy underlying sections 109 and 114 to allow the associated complaints of Westpac to be relied on in support of a validity challenge. To allow taxpayer litigants to trawl through processes which were antecedent to the issuing of an assessment (and the pre-assessment disputes procedure) with a view to identifying and then relying on perceived departures from internal department procedures is inconsistent with the orderly and efficient resolution of tax disputes. Such breaches could hardly be regarded as exceptional (in the sense of being rare) and to allow them to invalidate later assessments would leave very little scope for sections 109 and 114. Common-sense suggests that Inland Revenue Department officers will sometimes take shortcuts, perhaps occasionally with the knowledge that in doing so they are not conforming to, or are departing from, what is provided for in the departmental manual. Advertent departures from departmental procedures can hardly be exceptional (again in the sense of being rare). And in a situation in which the officer issuing an assessment believes that it is well founded on the facts and law, and that there is no legal impediment to it being issued, we take the view that an advertent departure is not conscious maladministration and in any event is not an exceptional circumstance in the relevant sense of excluding the operation of sections 109 and 114. This is all the more so where, as here, the alleged departure from department procedures is entirely collateral to the accuracy or otherwise of the assessment.
> 
> \[95\] In reaching this view we have had regard to a number of overlapping policy considerations:

1.  First and foremost the statutory policy reflected in sections 109 and 114;
2.  Secondly, the general undesirability of allowing judicial review in tax litigation (see \[62\], \[63\] and \[64\]);
3.  Finally, we see it as contrary to the need to treat taxpayers equally to permit a taxpayer to rely on a departure (advertent or otherwise) from a department procedure to defeat an assessment where the departure is irrelevant to the accuracy of the assessment. If this were permitted, it would amount to a judicially conferred dispensation for that taxpayer from the requirement to pay taxes which are owed and thus necessarily unfair to those taxpayers who do meet their obligations.

"Structured finance" transactions are tax avoidance arrangements
================================================================

2009 case note - Structured finance transactions entered into by BNZ are tax avoidance arrangements therefore void as against the CIR for income tax purposes.

Case

BNZ Investments Limited & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

Six structured finance transactions entered into by BNZ are tax avoidance arrangements and are therefore void as against the Commissioner for income tax purposes.

### Impact of decision

As with all tax avoidance cases, the decisions are specific to the facts. However, this decision is an indication of how a Court of first instance will apply the indicia and criteria as set out in the Supreme Court's _Ben Nevis_ decision in a tax avoidance case.

It is likely that this decision will be considered by the Courts when deciding other structured finance cases that come before them.

The decision has been appealed by the disputant.

### Facts

BNZ Investments Limited ("BNZ"), during 1998 and 2005 entered six "structured finance" transactions. BNZ borrowed money to fund those transactions and incurred interest costs in relation to that borrowing. The return on those transactions was by way of income that was free of income tax because of, in one transaction, a foreign tax credit ("FTC") and, in the other five, the operation of the conduit regime. Each of these transactions involved the provision of NZD$500 million of funding.

As part of the transactions, BNZ paid a guarantee procurement fee ("GPF") to the counter-party in the transactions for that counter-party to obtain a guarantee from its parent that the funds would be repaid.

Before entering the above six transactions, BNZ had obtained positive Rulings from the Commissioner in respect of two arguably similar transactions.

The Commissioner disallowed the deductions claimed in respect of the incurred interest costs and the GPF on the basis that the transactions were tax avoidance arrangements and were therefore void as against the Commissioner. The Commissioner further disallowed the GPF on a black letter law basis. It was these disallowances that were challenged by BNZ.

The transactions were complex and involved numerous steps but the above issues were the key elements for publication purposes.

### Decision

The Court decided that the obtained Rulings were not relevant. The reasons for this were twofold:

1.  that a binding ruling only applies to the transactions ruled upon
2.  that the six transactions were not identical to the transactions that were ruled upon (paragraph 45 of the decision).

The Court decided that the GPF was deductible on a black letter law basis as it was by definition a "financial arrangement" (paragraphs 143-162).

Before the Court proceeded to consider whether the transactions were tax avoidance arrangements, it considered the Supreme Court's decision in _Ben Nevis_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289_._ This was to determine how the law relating to tax avoidance should be applied. The Court determined that to apply _Ben Nevis_ correctly a two-step inquiry was required.

That two-step inquiry was summarised as follows (paragraph 137):

*   1.  Step 1 requires me, upon an ordinary interpretation of the applicable specific provisions to decide whether the arrangements comply with those provisions.
    2.  Step 2 requires me to decide, upon the scheme and purpose of the Act including section BG 1, whether the legislature would have contemplated and intended that the specific provisions be deployed as they were deployed by the taxpayer in the transactions in issue.

As the Commissioner had not disputed the claimed interest deductions on a black letter law basis and the Court had found that the GPF was deductible at a black letter law level the Court proceeded to step 2.

The Court found that the transactions were not within the scheme and purpose of the FTC regime or the conduit regime (paragraphs 487 and 491).

The Court found that the GPF was a contrivance (paragraph 511).

The Court set out six principal reasons why it considered that the transactions were caught by section BG 1 and were therefore tax avoidance arrangements (paragraph 526).

The Court held that all the deductions disallowed by the Commissioner were integral parts of the tax avoidance arrangements and were therefore correctly treated as void under section BG 1 (paragraph 539). Therefore the Commissioner's reconstruction was correct.

Student loan borrowers starting to get on top of their debt
===========================================================

**26 September 2018**

Student loan borrowers based overseas are showing a greater commitment to paying off their debt, latest figures reveal.

Loan repayments by overseas borrowers are 40% higher than four years ago and as a result, this eagerness to do the right thing is slowing the rise of debt in default.

Inland Revenue customer segment leader Bernadette Newman says people are becoming more aware that their student loan obligations don’t end when they leave the country.

“No one wants that feeling of returning home only to find their student debt has spiralled out of control due to non-payment penalties and interest.

“Luckily, it’s never been easier to pay off your student loan while working overseas. There is a range of fee free options that makes it much more convenient to set up regular payments.

“The difficulty of sending money home was previously a big barrier for borrowers but since that’s been removed by using our free service fee options, we’ve seen a steady pick up in overseas repayments.”

One of the big due dates for student loan borrowers overseas is September 30.

Ms Newman says now is as good a time as any to remind family members overseas to log-in to their myIR accounts, check out their balance and then encourage them to make a dent in it.

“The smart thing to do is keep up with small and regular instalments to avoid having to pay late payment interest when you default.”

Fewer borrowers are defaulting on their loans and the rate of increase in the amount of default debt has slowed by half over the past four years.

“The amount of debt in default at $1.32 billion remains significant,” says Ms Newman, “but we’re hoping that the change in attitudes we’re seeing and the fact more ex-students are taking ownership of their loan balance, will slow any further growth in that figure.

“We’re seeing the majority of the borrowers do the right thing but there are still some people who have consistently avoided and ignored their loan obligations over a long period of time.

“Inland Revenue is tracking down more of these borrowers all the time so it always pays to make contact with us and get back on track before we contact you.”   Find out just how easy it is to pay off your student loan at [www.ird.govt.nz/myloan](https://www.ird.govt.nz/myloan)

What

Interest is added to overseas based customers' student loans.

When

Interest is calculated daily and added to your loan balance at the end of the tax year.

Rate

Daily rate: 0.009041%. Annual rate: 3.3%

If you're a New Zealand-based customer, you're entitled to an interest-free student loan.

If you become overseas-based interest will be added to your student loan, but there are some situations where interest is not charged. It's calculated each day on your loan balance using the current interest rate. Interest is always included in your loan balance, but interest is only charged on this interest after 31 March each year.

The interest rate is set at the start of each [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
, 1 April. The annual interest rate is currently 3.3%.

[Moving overseas or returning to New Zealand](/student-loans/going-overseas-or-returning-to-new-zealand)

Late payment interest
---------------------

If you do not make your payments on time, we may charge late payment interest. 

This is only charged on the overdue amount, and only if the overdue amount is $334 or more. It will keep being charged until you have caught up with your payments.

The late payment interest rate is currently 7.3%. This is calculated as a monthly rate of 0.588%. The standard interest rate applies to the rest of your loan.

### Reduced late payment interest rates

If you contact us about late payments on your student loan, we may be able to reduce the amount of late payment interest you need to pay.

You can arrange an instalment plan to pay off your late payment amount. If you stick to the plan we can switch you to the reduced late payment rate so you pay less interest.

The reduced late payment interest rate is currently 5.3%. This is calculated as a monthly rate of 0.431%.

Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013
======================================

Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013 broadens the definition of income for repayment purposes, and implements an information-match with NZ Customs.

Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2013
--------------------------------------

The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill (No 2) was introduced into Parliament on 23 August 2012, receiving its first reading on 20 September 2012, its second reading on 28 February 2013 and the third reading on 28 March 2013. It received Royal assent on 29 March 2013.

The new legislation brings into effect two key measures to:

*   broaden the definition of income for student loan repayment purposes to align generally with that used for Working for Families Tax Credits, and
*   implement an ongoing information-match with the New Zealand Customs Service to identify borrowers who are in serious default on their loans when they enter or leave New Zealand.

The new legislation also contains several administrative efficiency measures.

Supplementary Order Paper No 185 amended the transitional regulation-making provision in the new legislation to clarify its operation.

The Supplementary Order Paper also included several amendments to ensure clarity, alignment of terminology, and correction of certain references and cross-references to ensure the legislation operates as intended.

The new legislation amends the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, the Accident Compensation Act 2001, the Customs and Excise Act 1996, the Privacy Act 1993, the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2012, the Student Loan Scheme (Budget Measures) Amendment Act 2012, and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

All section references are to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 unless otherwise stated.
